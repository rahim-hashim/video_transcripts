# Tucker Carlson and Michael Shellenberger Break Down the California Fires
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY)
*  So I guess the first question is thank you for doing this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=0.0s)]
*  What are we rolling? We're rolling. Okay. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2.0s)]
*  Good to be with you [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, as I've said to you privately, but I and I mean it I think you're maybe the best reporter working [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=10.52s)]
*  I know you don't even think of yourself as a reporter [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=15.64s)]
*  But a gatherer of facts and an explainer of what they mean. I think you're the best [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  You [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=30.0s)]
*  So [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=43.64s)]
*  Where do these fires first of all how many fires are there and where do they come from? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=44.88s)]
*  I believe there's five active fires right now and these are ignition driven fires [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=47.84s)]
*  Meaning that this these are all this is all shopper all or you know scrubland. Yes, no brush area [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=53.0s)]
*  So this isn't this is different than the Sierra forests, right? These are not forest fires [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=58.96s)]
*  Yeah, these are not forest fires and that doesn't mean that you're doomed to them [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=62.64s)]
*  But it's the it's not the same problem that we get in the Sierras [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=66.12s)]
*  So they're ignition driven and they're obviously wind driven [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  But there's nothing unusual, you know [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=73.6s)]
*  I just interviewed a climate scientist about this or rather a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=76.04s)]
*  Environmental forest science scientist about this. There's nothing unusual about this. I mean, it is somewhat unusual to get [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=79.72s)]
*  You know, you have a dry period and then the Santa Ana winds in January, but it's not like that never happens [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=91.4s)]
*  I'm working my way there. So of course ignition [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=92.92s)]
*  I mean the important thing to know is that the National Weather Service put out a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=95.36s)]
*  Fire warning on January 2nd and a local weatherman actually forecasted on January 1st [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=100.2s)]
*  They said we're headed towards super dangerous moment [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  The next day the National Weather Service Los Angeles held a briefing to underscore that point the day after that the mayor [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=111.28s)]
*  Flew to Ghana. I mean, it's crazy like you would have public press conferences [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=118.0s)]
*  Yeah, these were oh, I mean, it's absolutely public and it goes to the politicians first, but it's all said public [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  It's the National Weather Service. So [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=128.56s)]
*  That so that so that was like literally on the first or second the governor should have called out the National Guard [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=130.44s)]
*  Should have called all of our neighboring states. He should have called Canada and Mexico asked for all their backup help [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=136.67999999999998s)]
*  They should have started circling c-130s that are you know, especially retrofitted with that can dump the fire retardant or water [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  They should have had helicopters circling to see where the fires were. It should have been immediate mobilization [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=149.48s)]
*  Pardon my ignorance. I I didn't first of all, I didn't see that news when it happened [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=155.48s)]
*  But I didn't know that so it was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=159.76s)]
*  Really clear to the people who run the city in the state that you had this combination of dry conditions and heavy winds high winds [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and and because there's so many ignitions because of really these two factors [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=168.94000000000003s)]
*  mostly the electrical wires, you know [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  brushing up against [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=178.0s)]
*  You know vegetation and you're gonna fire. That's kind of the one the main ones [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=179.68s)]
*  The other one is homeless people starting fires all over LA [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=182.96s)]
*  Half of all fires put out by the LA Fire Department are started by homeless people. It's been that way for years [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=188.42s)]
*  Why do homeless people start fires? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, it turns out meth heads love to start fires [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=197.22s)]
*  You know, there's just every drug has its kind of weird element to but meth heads love starting fires [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=201.66s)]
*  They love destroying things like meth is like the drug of nihilism. So it's like perfect drug for LA and California at the moment [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=208.3s)]
*  So it's not these are not cooking fires [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=215.38s)]
*  They could be cooking fires, but starting fires to destroy things. Yeah. Oh for sure. Oh, yeah for sure [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=217.46s)]
*  You know, it's not evil or anything. No, it told me fine. Yeah, what could go wrong? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=223.46s)]
*  But isn't classically starting fires and torturing animals aren't those like signs of sociopathic? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean for sure. I mean look meth makes you psych, you know makes you psychopathic. It makes you psychotic [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=233.82s)]
*  It's meth and do psychosis. But I mean, yeah and all the crazy. I mean people behave [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean things that people do on meth. I mean it is like [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=244.42s)]
*  it's like they behave with like superhuman crazy powers the levels of violence the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=247.42s)]
*  Assaults the I mean you just when you interview people particularly people in recovery that describe being on meth [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=253.26s)]
*  I mean, they're just awake for like weeks at a time. Like it's not even clear how they get any sleep at all [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=259.6s)]
*  So that's just that madness has continued and you know and mayor bass who's the so just to isolate. Yeah saying and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=265.82s)]
*  Just to pause to kind of it's really important point [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=274.42s)]
*  Fires at least half of fires in LA County are started by homeless people [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=277.7s)]
*  Yeah, and you believe that's driven by their use of a specific drug meth [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=281.26s)]
*  Not totally. I mean, I think homeless people are gonna often start fires for a lot of different reasons [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=286.54s)]
*  I mean drugs can start fires, but but the meth heads are like into fire. Like it's a big part of meth culture [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=291.24s)]
*  It's just starting things on fire. No one sees this in theological terms. It's like this. I know it's amazing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=297.96s)]
*  It was amazing. Yeah. No, it's satanic. I mean [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=302.65999999999997s)]
*  It's awful [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=307.42s)]
*  So, but you know you kind of go I mean, so first of all that problem should have been dealt with obviously years ago [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=309.42s)]
*  It should never have been allowed [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=315.26s)]
*  So but that they knew on January 1st January 2nd that the fires were coming [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=317.26s)]
*  Like it was inevitable that there would be fires [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=322.82s)]
*  Like there was like zero doubt among anybody that knows anything about fire in Los Angeles that the fires were coming [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=325.34s)]
*  The fires were coming so then like the governor should have been the mayor should have been there [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=331.26s)]
*  The governor should have been the mayor should have been there you should like literally you should it's all about but it's all about prevention in part [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  Because by the time the fire trucks are having to weave their way up those little hills of the Pacific Palisades [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=341.58s)]
*  It's over. I mean, so the other thing to keep in mind is that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=348.38s)]
*  Okay. Well, so that's the first thing is that they just have to mobilize in advance [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=351.82s)]
*  So that's a feature for people aren't aware of the geography of LA. Oh, it's just incredibly [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=354.82s)]
*  It's why it's so beautiful. I beautiful places are exactly right. So [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=359.42s)]
*  So that was so that that's like the main event so the I mean because I knew I did my first thing I did [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=363.5s)]
*  Is I was like look they're gonna come out and say it was inevitable and that's just a total lie because of global warming [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=369.06s)]
*  Yeah, because of global warming and I mean anyway, we can get so there's so many places to go here [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=374.14s)]
*  But just on the most practical sense [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=379.78s)]
*  They knew the fires were coming and they didn't do anything the mayor leaves the country [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=382.26s)]
*  She flies to Ghana after having promised not to leave the country by the way as mayor [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=387.34s)]
*  She's traveled six at least six times out of the country and she promised not to travel [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=392.22s)]
*  Why is it important the mayor be there? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=397.38s)]
*  You see him or the other people in charge because it's a command it's an emergency command situation [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  She has to be able to issue orders and to you know, wave regulations and make things happen [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=403.42s)]
*  The governor has to be doing that they didn't do that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=409.3s)]
*  They should have had by the way the they get they get the fire trucks up into the fiery areas right away [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=412.4s)]
*  They can also start, you know, they can start clearing brush. They can start [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=417.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, but literally they could just be in those neighborhoods just sitting there for days at a time waiting for the fires to happen [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=422.18s)]
*  Put them out as soon as they happen [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=427.98s)]
*  I'm not saying that they would have been able to prevent all the fires from happening [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=430.1s)]
*  But you remember like the big fire in 19 in 1993 [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=434.14s)]
*  I think it was Laguna Beach or maybe it was Malibu as well, but it was like 700 homes [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=437.46000000000004s)]
*  We're at 10,000, you know structures at this point homes and buildings gone, you know, 200,000 people evacuated [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=443.06s)]
*  I mean, it's like it's it's madness. It never needed to get to that level [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=450.26000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so that's the first thing they just needed to have been there before the fire started and they didn't do that because the politicians are just [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=455.58000000000004s)]
*  They're focused on themselves. They're focused on the next political office. They want to get [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=463.74s)]
*  So that was the first thing the second thing is the water runs out, right? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=469.06s)]
*  So everybody so that was the and you hear people go [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=472.78000000000003s)]
*  Oh, well, there's something you can do because like once the homes are burned down like the water lines [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=474.72s)]
*  You can see the pictures, you know the water like will be spilling out, you know of the homes and so that lowered the water pressure [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=478.7s)]
*  That was a total lie. There is something called the Santa Ines [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=484.53999999999996s)]
*  Water reservoir which is the potable water meaning the drinking water that also goes into the fire hydrant system because the fire hydrant [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=489.06s)]
*  You know, the the fire hydrant system is the drinking water system. It's the same thing. There's exact same system [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=495.82s)]
*  That reservoir was empty and it was the second largest of the 10 [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=501.41999999999996s)]
*  Water potable water reservoirs that serve LA County [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=507.5s)]
*  There let me make one distinction here because there's actually two kinds of reservoirs [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  There's the reservoir with the snow melt water these really big lakes basically [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=515.02s)]
*  and then there's the and that's that's the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=520.46s)]
*  Unpurified water and then those and then they purify it and then they feed into these [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=523.62s)]
*  Reservoirs where they store the water for for all sorts of reasons for emergencies [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=527.54s)]
*  So that is an absolute crime that that Santa Ines reservoir why because first of all [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=531.58s)]
*  It was rich right next to the Pacific Palisades. So for people that don't know Pacific Palisades, of course [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=537.28s)]
*  It's like right near it's on your way to Malibu [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=542.64s)]
*  It's like the last big neighborhood before you get to them and their palisades through water [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=544.74s)]
*  That's right [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=548.74s)]
*  And so they have a reservoir you look at the Google Maps and you look at where the Santinez reservoir is [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=549.46s)]
*  It's right next to like a few thousand feet [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=554.06s)]
*  From Pacific Palisades and it's above it's really high up [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=557.14s)]
*  And so if you had had water coming from that the firefighters would have had plenty of water [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=560.26s)]
*  It would not have they would have had the water pressure [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=565.14s)]
*  Even if you had lost some homes and had those those the water out. So I mean so two major [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=567.74s)]
*  Failures the first was the failure to aggressively respond days in advance even though they had very clear warnings [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=575.02s)]
*  The second was the reservoir was empty [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=580.9000000000001s)]
*  One reporter has reported that the that the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=583.8199999999999s)]
*  The firefighters had not been warned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=587.54s)]
*  that that reservoir was empty if that's true, that's just additionally scandalous, but [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=592.86s)]
*  one of the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=599.46s)]
*  one of the things that we think probably happened is that they [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=601.06s)]
*  Had been required to build have a cover for the clean for the for the Santinez reservoir [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=604.66s)]
*  Which is the potable water the cover to prevent the water from being contaminated in the old days like the 50s and 60s [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=610.2199999999999s)]
*  You know birds would poop in those reservoirs and they would just put a bunch of chlorine in them, right? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=616.78s)]
*  And then we decided well that the water was still had a lot of you know [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=622.02s)]
*  It still was not particularly clean. So we wanted to be cleaner [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=625.18s)]
*  So you can just put a cover over it, which is a kind of plastic or rubber lining [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=628.18s)]
*  It appears that there was a tear in that they had to repair it [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=633.3399999999999s)]
*  They should not have removed that water ever [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=637.34s)]
*  During a fire season if you need to make that repair you you do need to drain right, you know [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=641.5s)]
*  Right before you do the repair, but you would make that drain the people that I interviewed [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=646.1800000000001s)]
*  Said look it would take you know days if not a couple of weeks to repair it [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=650.0600000000001s)]
*  It was empty for at least a year [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=655.1s)]
*  so it was sitting there for a year and the person I interviewed who works at a as a senior executive at a [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=657.26s)]
*  different [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=662.78s)]
*  Water utility in California said if we had any of our reservoirs empty [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=664.34s)]
*  We would be like super nervous the entire time and you would also then have backup water systems [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=669.34s)]
*  So it's like any catastrophe, you know, you just have multiple errors occurring in advance and at the moment [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=674.86s)]
*  And then the fires and then the actual ignitions you can't completely prevent ignitions [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=682.26s)]
*  But you can significantly reduce them one would be to not allow people to camp outside all over [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=688.4200000000001s)]
*  Los Angeles Los Angeles County with [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=694.62s)]
*  Somewhere around I think it's 40 to 60 thousand homeless people in the whole county [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=697.74s)]
*  Madness and then the other is the electrical wires that brush up against the vegetation and create fire [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=703.86s)]
*  With that you want to clear the vegetation from around the wires [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=710.0600000000001s)]
*  That's obvious and then and then you can also just stop [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=713.5s)]
*  I mean, this is a not great solution [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=717.1s)]
*  But you could certainly do it in a pinch if you need to just stop the electricity from going into those homes for some [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=719.86s)]
*  Period. I mean, it's a drag we haven't I live in the Berkeley Hills, which is also a dangerous fire zone [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=725.0600000000001s)]
*  And when the winds are really strong, they'll just cut off power as a precaution [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=730.7800000000001s)]
*  So that if they're so that to prevent an ignition [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=735.1400000000001s)]
*  So I think the the thing that the reason I wanted to come on this your show [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=737.58s)]
*  Even though I'm in the midst of a huge book deadline is [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=742.98s)]
*  Because I'm really concerned about this nihilistic discourse that there's literally nothing that could be done [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=746.14s)]
*  I mean that is that is exactly where the politicians want to go [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=752.38s)]
*  I worry that you know ordinary people have that idea the problem is it's absurd [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=755.02s)]
*  I mean this idea that you couldn't live in Los Angeles, right? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=760.2s)]
*  And it's like it's like you can say it about anywhere you'd be like, oh, it's there's snow falls in this place during winter [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=763.6s)]
*  You know or hurricanes. I mean we're in an area that's Hurricane Valley, right? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=770.08s)]
*  Huge amounts of hurricanes [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=773.3s)]
*  That's that's not how humans roll [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=774.8199999999999s)]
*  Like we're capable of living in many different environments including with extreme weather conditions [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=777.46s)]
*  And it's like saying I can't stop my kids from dying of tetanus right starving to death, right? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=782.56s)]
*  I mean what yes, right so there's no nihilistic agency. No, that's so nihilistic and you trace it back [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=787.02s)]
*  I mean the the best the most articulate [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=792.8199999999999s)]
*  Advocate of that view is a Marxist named Mike Davis who wrote this book called City of Courts [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=795.7s)]
*  It's a crazy nihilistic book, but he he had an essay and also it's a chapter in that book called let Malibu burn [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=802.7s)]
*  I mean, it's classic [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=809.9000000000001s)]
*  kind of radical left [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=811.9000000000001s)]
*  politics is classic sort of [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=813.9000000000001s)]
*  Envy or sour grapes. I mean sour grapes goes I can't remember the the parable, but basically it's like some animal wants to eat these [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=815.9000000000001s)]
*  It's like some animal wants to eat these grapes, but they're up too high and he says oh well those grapes were sour anyway [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=823.7s)]
*  It's like it's a consolation for your own personal weakness and failure [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=830.3000000000001s)]
*  That's just you know, let Malibu burn [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=833.94s)]
*  I mean, you know you have an ideology of Marxism that is based on resentment and envy and so then you go [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=835.94s)]
*  Well, yeah, those rich all those rich houses should go up in flames. It's a fantasy [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=843.1400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's a left-wing fan. I should know I was on the radical left like the fantasy [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=846.72s)]
*  You hate the rich people because you because you want their wealth and you you admire them in some level [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=851.98s)]
*  But you know, you can't get it. So I mean this is how envy works [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=857.92s)]
*  So you end up constructing this whole political ideology? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=860.62s)]
*  I mean, this is what Marx has done and it's infected like the citizenry. I mean, it's infected the politicians [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=863.38s)]
*  And so there's this I think that even though it's not consciously the politicians aren't consciously saying oh [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=870.18s)]
*  Let's let Malibu burn that is the con that is the behavior the behaviors they have taken have had that impact [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=877.0600000000001s)]
*  So I think that what you're seeing in real time in these in these fire these fires in Los Angeles [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=884.82s)]
*  Destruction fires is the manifestation of a nihilistic ideology. It's an emergent quality [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=890.98s)]
*  It happens through a million small steps [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=897.32s)]
*  But this heavy focus on left-wing ideology whether it's DEI or ESG or climate apocalypse or just class resentment [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=899.46s)]
*  Manifest itself is in like the most spectacular beautiful neighborhoods just being turned into ashes and cinders [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=907.46s)]
*  It's also on a more prosaic level of violation of like the most basic agreement [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=914.74s)]
*  There is between citizens and their government, which is I send you more than half of what I own [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=919.64s)]
*  But you keep my house from burning down and methods from scaring my children or whatever like you provide public safety [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=924.94s)]
*  fire protection [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=932.34s)]
*  You know water sewer electricity like just the basic stuff seems to be totally ignored [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=934.02s)]
*  Absolutely. So why is anyone paying taxes? Why isn't there a revolution there should be well because of course, they're all trapped by this ideology [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=940.1s)]
*  I mean, these are the neighborhoods that voted overwhelmingly for Kamala that voted overwhelmingly for Gavin Newsom that voted overwhelmingly for Karen Bass [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=946.58s)]
*  I mean Tucker I I watched folk. I saw focus groups [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=953.98s)]
*  in 2022 with [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=958.98s)]
*  Two Latinos men and women separated Latino group and a white group and [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=962.06s)]
*  The Latinos were great. I mean they were just like when they start time at the mayoral race [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=968.3s)]
*  They were like, well, what are their positions and like what are their policies and what do they want to do and whatever? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=972.0999999999999s)]
*  They're very rational about they're very as you would hope you they were self-interested. They were what do I get out of? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=976.0s)]
*  What do I get out of these cameras? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=981.02s)]
*  The white the whites I mean it was amazing like they first of all they every focus group when the the moderator would just be like [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=982.78s)]
*  Hey, you know just how's it going around here? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=989.62s)]
*  They don't even try to lead to the conversation anywhere and everybody just starts talking about the homeless situation and the crime [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=991.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, which is basically continuous with homelessness and then they would be like, oh, yeah. Okay. Well about the remedies [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=996.6600000000001s)]
*  Oh, there's a mayoral race coming up. I think it was in the it was like in the summer [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1002.74s)]
*  You know that yeah focus groups were held in Caruso versus bass Caruso versus bass and they hadn't really been thinking a ton about it [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1006.0600000000001s)]
*  But there's a moment there where you see it dawns on the white focus group participants [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  And they were not like recruiting like leftists or Democrats or anything. It was just supposed to be a mixed group of swing voters and [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1018.3199999999999s)]
*  They just as soon as it dawned on them that there was a black woman running. They were like, oh well [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1024.6s)]
*  I mean, that's I mean got a vote for the black woman like it was the most racist [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1030.68s)]
*  Like you would think like in the in the most racist moments in American history [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1037.36s)]
*  You know the stereotypes that we would have, you know about the South or whatever [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1041.48s)]
*  But you know reconstruction or something like people would not be as open and honest about it [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1046.52s)]
*  But they were just like openly like well [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1050.98s)]
*  We have to vote for the black woman and then in the rest of the focus group [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1053.4s)]
*  When they a lot of them knew who Caruso was because you know, he's famous for these really spectacular [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1059.0s)]
*  You know housing developments and also they're like kind of calling them malls is a kind of just little side [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1063.6200000000001s)]
*  Beautiful like an outdoor shopping centers with like lawns and you can get like a [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1070.4s)]
*  Fantastic restaurants and you can like have the kids can play freely on these lawns [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1075.48s)]
*  I mean it's sort of tragic because of course, it's all private. It's not public spaces, but nonetheless you feel safe you go in there [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1079.08s)]
*  It's amazing place. So they knew for that. I want these white participants [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  I was watching them through basically over like the next hour hour and a half [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1088.88s)]
*  I mean, I had to watch that for about an hour and a half [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1092.8799999999999s)]
*  Explaining why Caruso was a bad guy for just running against this black woman [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1096.7s)]
*  Like it was just outrageous and what is he trying to do? He's trying to make money [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1102.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, which is just crazy because of course he's just you know, like he's like a billionaire. I mean he's self-made and [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1105.8s)]
*  Extraordinarily successful person and clearly running for mayor is an altruistic act [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1113.12s)]
*  So it was just appalling. So of course, I mean I have to say, you know [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1118.2s)]
*  every big white country in the last year, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1121.24s)]
*  Australia, Canada, UK, US, obviously, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1123.76s)]
*  and that very specific brand of self-hatred, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1127.6s)]
*  nihilism, that brain disease is everywhere. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1131.96s)]
*  It's not just here, it's throughout the Anglosphere. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1135.76s)]
*  And it's history changing and it's effects. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1140.0s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1141.8s)]
*  Why is the white world determined to kill itself? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1143.04s)]
*  Do you have any idea? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1146.92s)]
*  It's really noticeable. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1148.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's so much in that. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1149.42s)]
*  I mean, it seems like there's multiple levels. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1150.74s)]
*  I mean, at one superficial level, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1152.8600000000001s)]
*  or at least a kind of psychological, sociological level, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1154.6200000000001s)]
*  they're all competing with each other [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1157.0600000000002s)]
*  to show who's a better person. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1158.38s)]
*  The more hatred I express towards white people, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1162.38s)]
*  the better I am as a human being. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1165.38s)]
*  But destroying your own kids is like the measure of virtue. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1166.8600000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the nihilism. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1169.5800000000002s)]
*  Obviously, this is a very old story about decadence [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1172.66s)]
*  and of comfort, and you start to kind of believe. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1175.72s)]
*  I mean, there's something really checked out [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1179.96s)]
*  from reality about the whole thing. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1181.98s)]
*  I mean, first of all, the stories that get told [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1183.84s)]
*  are just absurd, like 1619 being the founding of America. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1188.3999999999999s)]
*  That's just obviously wrong. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1193.9199999999998s)]
*  The country was founded, our constitution is 1789, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1195.8s)]
*  Declaration of Independence is 1776, and all of that. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1199.28s)]
*  But slavery was never at the heart of the United States. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1202.2s)]
*  It was a whole place committed to, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1206.0800000000002s)]
*  it was English Americans, or the American English, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1207.94s)]
*  as they were referred to, wanting to create a country [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1211.16s)]
*  the first time that was just founded [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1213.76s)]
*  on the Enlightenment ideals of freedom and of free expression. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1215.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's so important they put us the First Amendment, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1219.24s)]
*  they insisted on the Bill of Rights. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1220.92s)]
*  So you just get this completely twisted [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1222.54s)]
*  disinformation story about the United States [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1227.0800000000002s)]
*  that gets embraced. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1229.48s)]
*  But yeah, it's nihilism. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1231.0s)]
*  But embraced by whites, at its aimed. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1232.92s)]
*  So it is a, I mean, leaving aside the fact that it's false, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1235.48s)]
*  but a lot of creation myths are false, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1238.48s)]
*  but this one is false in a specific way, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1240.36s)]
*  which is like, you suck and you should die, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1242.6s)]
*  and all the whites are like, yeah, you're right, I should. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1244.96s)]
*  It's- [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1247.36s)]
*  It means end of civilization sort of ideology, isn't it? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1248.32s)]
*  That's it, it's like, I've never seen anything like it. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1251.08s)]
*  No, I mean, when you read the old- [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1254.48s)]
*  And it is the whites too. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1255.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, because the Latinos, I mean, they're still- [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1257.08s)]
*  They're like, what? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1259.68s)]
*  For sure. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1261.52s)]
*  They're like more working class, they're more Christian, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1262.36s)]
*  they love America more, they remember where they came from. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1265.52s)]
*  I agree. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1268.96s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, it's also, yeah, so it's just, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1269.96s)]
*  in some ways, it's an old story of a civilization [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1273.2s)]
*  just at its end, I mean, including all the transgenderism. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1276.42s)]
*  I mean, that's the Camille Polly is famous [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1279.8799999999999s)]
*  writing about how that shows up at the end of civilizations. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1282.8s)]
*  And so, you know, if you read Toynbee, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1287.28s)]
*  it's like, one of the characteristics is when the elites [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1289.1599999999999s)]
*  stop the creative class of elites, which is, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1292.0s)]
*  I mean, Los Angeles, they stop identifying [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1295.36s)]
*  with their own working class, and they start to identify [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1298.8999999999999s)]
*  with outsiders, basically, with people from foreigners [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1301.72s)]
*  from outside the country, that's another sign [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1306.56s)]
*  of a civilization at its end. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1308.48s)]
*  So we were meeting here at TCN the other day, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1310.72s)]
*  and I looked around the room and every other person [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1312.6599999999999s)]
*  had a kind of ruddy vitality, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1315.52s)]
*  sort of pink cheeks, alertness, bright eyes, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1319.12s)]
*  full mental acuity, and a cheerfulness [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1323.48s)]
*  you could almost smell. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1326.32s)]
*  And I asked, why does everyone look so good? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1328.6s)]
*  And part of the answer, of course, is they like [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1332.02s)]
*  what we do for a living, it's really interesting, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1334.22s)]
*  we think it's important. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1336.1399999999999s)]
*  But another reason everyone looks so good [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1337.6s)]
*  is because they had all had a great night's sleep. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1340.16s)]
*  I'm not making this up, almost everybody here uses [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1344.8s)]
*  a new sleep technology from a company called 8Sleep. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1349.1599999999999s)]
*  They sent it to us, and everyone here loves it, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1353.1599999999999s)]
*  it's called the pod. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1355.8999999999999s)]
*  It's a high-tech mattress cover, effectively, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1357.36s)]
*  that you add to your existing bed, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1359.62s)]
*  you don't need a new bed or anything like that, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1361.12s)]
*  you just throw this over what you have. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1362.84s)]
*  What it does is adjust the temperature of your bed, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1364.9199999999998s)]
*  warmer or cooler, depending on what you want, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1369.36s)]
*  and it maintains an ideal sleeping environment [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1372.04s)]
*  all night long. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1374.28s)]
*  So I didn't know this, but as you progress [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1375.8s)]
*  through different phases of sleep, your body's needs change. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1377.76s)]
*  And 8Sleep automatically keeps things exactly [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1381.6s)]
*  where they should be in the sweet spot [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1384.56s)]
*  through the entire night. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1386.96s)]
*  It's been proven to increase the quality of your sleep, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1388.92s)]
*  the amount you sleep, every night. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1392.2s)]
*  It improves your recovery time from physical exertion, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1394.8999999999999s)]
*  and it may even improve your cognitive performance [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1397.3999999999999s)]
*  and enhance your overall health. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1400.24s)]
*  It seems to be doing that in our office. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1402.72s)]
*  So it learns and adapts to your sleep patterns over time [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1405.16s)]
*  and automatically adjusts temperatures throughout the night [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1408.08s)]
*  through each phase of sleep. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1410.72s)]
*  And it does this independently for each sleeper [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1412.48s)]
*  on either side of the bed, that's pretty cool. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1416.68s)]
*  So you can sleep well and feel much better [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1419.48s)]
*  and be more effective the next morning as we are here. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1423.08s)]
*  Try it for yourself. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1427.0s)]
*  Go to 8Sleep.com slash Tucker, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1428.14s)]
*  use the promo code Tucker to get an extra 350 bucks [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1430.96s)]

*  Again, that's 8Sleep.com slash Tucker. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1440.8s)]
*  Better sleep today and look great in your morning meetings, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1443.8s)]
*  as our guys do. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1448.68s)]
*  You alluded a minute ago to its cause being affluence. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1449.76s)]
*  Just generational affluence makes people- [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1453.88s)]
*  Seems like it. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1455.28s)]
*  It feels that way to me too, I'm not an expert. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1456.38s)]
*  It's a cliche, but like a lot of cliches, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1459.3999999999999s)]
*  it's got a lot of truth to it, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1461.48s)]
*  is the good times make soft men and soft men make bad times. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1462.32s)]
*  So there's obviously been a huge correction [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1469.28s)]
*  in the United States, which is welcome, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1471.96s)]
*  which is a sort of re-embrace of the ideals [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1474.56s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  Let's hope that this has been a wake-up call [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1482.52s)]
*  for the people of Los Angeles. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1484.76s)]
*  I mean, they are reaping what they sowed, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1486.28s)]
*  and the people of California are reaping what we sowed. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1489.56s)]
*  And that is, I mean, it's really quite symbolic. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1492.32s)]
*  It's like the neighborhoods of the elites in Los Angeles [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1498.68s)]
*  that are really got the most effected, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1502.24s)]
*  that are having to flee. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1504.48s)]
*  But again, I mean, part of the reason I wanted to come on, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1506.44s)]
*  I've been writing about it every day [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1508.28s)]
*  and trying to surface the stories of the utility, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1509.8799999999999s)]
*  the water utility executives, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1512.3999999999999s)]
*  and I've got a story coming out later today [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1513.56s)]
*  from a firefighter who basically just described, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1514.88s)]
*  I mean, the firefighters, of course, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1520.6000000000001s)]
*  the men and women on the ground doing the hard work, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1523.0800000000002s)]
*  they're blameless, but I mean, the destruction, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1525.72s)]
*  there's 29 fire departments in Los Angeles, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1528.3600000000001s)]
*  including LA County Fire Department. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1531.6000000000001s)]
*  There's 88 cities, and people don't realize, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1534.8400000000001s)]
*  like Los Angeles is a city, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1537.44s)]
*  but then there's a much larger county around it [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1538.8400000000001s)]
*  with 88 cities in it. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1540.96s)]
*  And not all of them have fire departments, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1543.36s)]
*  in fact, most of them don't, right? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1545.48s)]
*  So the ones that don't have their own fire departments, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1546.44s)]
*  they depend on LA County Fire Department. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1548.92s)]
*  But anyway, and it's been this way for a long time, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1551.6s)]
*  so it's not like it can't work, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1554.0s)]
*  but it definitely introduces a level of complexity into it. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1555.28s)]
*  I mean, the priorities of these fire departments, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1558.52s)]
*  it's not just like a social media meme. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1560.32s)]
*  I mean, it really has been DEI, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1562.4s)]
*  like it really has been the priority [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1565.36s)]
*  of these fire departments. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1567.4s)]
*  The first priority of the fire departments [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1568.84s)]
*  should be to put out fires and keep people safe [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1570.2s)]
*  and save lives, but the first priority has been DEI. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1572.72s)]
*  I mean, that is clearly- [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1575.8400000000001s)]
*  Is there evidence, do we have social science [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1577.0800000000002s)]
*  that shows that lesbians are better firemen [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1579.24s)]
*  than non-lesbians? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1580.96s)]
*  I mean, what are the chances, right? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1583.16s)]
*  That like all three of these executives are, I mean, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1586.28s)]
*  you know, it's also sort of like, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1591.2s)]
*  I mean, it's funny because the way that the defenders of it [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1592.96s)]
*  sort of talk about it is as though [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1596.6399999999999s)]
*  they're imposing a quality, actually they're demanding [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1598.12s)]
*  that it not be based on merit. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1602.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, first of all, there was never any evidence [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1604.4399999999998s)]
*  that the fire departments were like systematically [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1606.6s)]
*  or structurally excluding qualified people. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1608.84s)]
*  I mean, that's not to say that never happened, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1612.04s)]
*  there wasn't some racism, I mean, of course there is, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1614.56s)]
*  but it's like, they got into a situation [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  where like people are getting promoted [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1619.24s)]
*  who were not as qualified as other people on basis of race. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1620.84s)]
*  I mean, that is anathema to the American system. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1624.0s)]
*  And by the way, the people of California [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1627.04s)]
*  have now twice rejected racial preferences. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1628.48s)]
*  One of them in 1996, I believe, and then the other again [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1631.08s)]
*  in 20, was it 2018, I believe. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1635.72s)]
*  They also rejected gay marriage, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1637.92s)]
*  but they're not allowed to get what they want, actually, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1639.24s)]
*  it turns out, because whatever you think of gay marriage [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1641.3600000000001s)]
*  or racial preferences or whatever, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1643.96s)]
*  if you believe in democracy and you have a referendum system, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1645.28s)]
*  you have to abide by the results. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1647.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, and they haven't. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1648.76s)]
*  No, they haven't. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1649.96s)]
*  I mean, the spirit of California, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1650.8s)]
*  there's a true spirit of California [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1652.52s)]
*  that I do think is very American, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1653.84s)]
*  which is really egalitarianism. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1656.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the American creed, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1658.44s)]
*  if you believe Daniel Bell's analysis of it, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1660.2s)]
*  it's liberty, it's laissez-faire, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  it's individualism, and it's egalitarianism. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1665.4s)]
*  That's the state I grew up in, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1667.52s)]
*  it was the most American of all states. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1668.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1670.16s)]
*  It's not equity, it's equality of opportunity, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1671.0s)]
*  that's what egalitarianism is. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1674.1200000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter who your family was. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1674.96s)]
*  We used to say when I was a kid, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1677.3600000000001s)]
*  no one in California used his last name, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1678.96s)]
*  now why would that be? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1680.68s)]
*  You go back east as we called it, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1682.0s)]
*  we'd go in the summertime, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1683.72s)]
*  I'd be like, hi, I'm Michael Schellberger, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1684.8s)]
*  in California, it's like, I'm Mike. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1686.8s)]
*  Well, my father would always say, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1688.52s)]
*  that's because in California, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1690.04s)]
*  it's not about the legacy of your family, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1691.8s)]
*  it's not about caste, it's about you. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1693.6s)]
*  Can you do it or not? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1696.0s)]
*  That seemed like a great system to me. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1697.64s)]
*  It's great. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1699.08s)]
*  I mean, that's the part I love about California, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1699.96s)]
*  is I lived on the East Coast for a year, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1702.16s)]
*  it was a traumatic experience. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1703.92s)]
*  You'd go to parties and someone would be like, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1705.32s)]
*  oh, what school did you go to? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1706.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1708.6s)]
*  And then they'd be kind of looking over your shoulder, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1709.44s)]
*  who cares what school I went to? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1712.1200000000001s)]
*  Who am I? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1714.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1715.0400000000002s)]
*  Where are my passions? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1715.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1716.72s)]
*  So that was like, wow, that is weird. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1717.5600000000002s)]
*  In California, it's like, what's your jam, dude? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1720.72s)]
*  It's really like, what are you into? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1722.6000000000001s)]
*  That's the best of it. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1724.5600000000002s)]
*  Who are you as a person? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1725.4s)]
*  Yeah, who are you as a person? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1726.68s)]
*  It's the human, obviously, you can get culty and whatever, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1727.68s)]
*  but it is the best of that human potential. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1731.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, you're not held responsible [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1733.76s)]
*  for the sins of people you're related to. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1735.24s)]
*  Well, I come from a complicated family, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1738.8400000000001s)]
*  I always loved that idea. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1741.8400000000001s)]
*  You're judged on you, the choices that you make [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1744.44s)]
*  and the character that you have. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1746.72s)]
*  Your decency. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1748.64s)]
*  Which is actually radical individual responsibility. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1749.52s)]
*  That's what I always thought. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1752.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that was always for me, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1753.48s)]
*  it was like, Victor Frankel, who wrote Man Search for Me, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1755.1200000000001s)]
*  he was this incredible Holocaust survivor, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1758.16s)]
*  the whole thing was like, being in a death camp, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1760.16s)]
*  shouldn't control how I think about the world. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1763.1200000000001s)]
*  That's about as radical of an individual mentality [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1766.0800000000002s)]
*  point of view, and now, of course, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1771.6000000000001s)]
*  that's viewed as very right-wing [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1772.8000000000002s)]
*  and very unsympathetic and whatever, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1774.88s)]
*  but Victor Frankel was just loved by the existentialist [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1776.8000000000002s)]
*  California left in the 60s. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1780.24s)]
*  He would sell out these huge auditorium in Berkeley [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1781.8000000000002s)]
*  and they'd go to Esalen. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1784.8400000000001s)]
*  So, you go from that to basically nobody [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1786.76s)]
*  taking responsibility, I mean, it's incredible. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1791.52s)]
*  Everyone living under the crushing burden of history, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1794.0s)]
*  most of it misconstrued in a lie anyway, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1797.2s)]
*  but still the idea that the past [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1799.1200000000001s)]
*  is determining the present and the future, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1801.4s)]
*  that's like the least California, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1803.72s)]
*  least American idea ever. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1805.2s)]
*  That's so well-spoken. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1807.08s)]
*  No, no, it's totally brilliantly well-spoken. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1808.1200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, yeah, I mean, it's like we, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1809.76s)]
*  in our next book, we're working on this idea [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1811.64s)]
*  of these singularities, meaning like these [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1814.48s)]
*  just awful events in the past, the Holocaust, slavery, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1816.8400000000001s)]
*  indigenous genocide, and they become like gods [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1820.92s)]
*  for secular people, they become like super present. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1824.7600000000002s)]
*  Like, it's just everything that we do [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1828.2800000000002s)]
*  is affected by slavery and everything. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1831.4s)]
*  This is indigenous land. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1834.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, I was just going through all of the various [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1835.16s)]

*  in those land acknowledgements. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1851.68s)]

*  And you may have seen, there's a clip that went viral [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1855.3600000000001s)]
*  on social media with the deputy police, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1858.44s)]
*  the deputy fire chief of Los Angeles, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1861.4s)]

*  can you carry my husband out of a house in danger? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1866.92s)]

*  in a place that he shouldn't have been. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1873.08s)]
*  That was her response. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1875.04s)]
*  It was like, dude. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1876.44s)]
*  I saw that video, and my first thought was, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1877.28s)]
*  that can't be, was that real? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1879.3999999999999s)]
*  I know, it looks like a parody. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1881.36s)]

*  You're like, yeah, that's literally your job [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1883.8799999999999s)]
*  is to be able to carry someone. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1885.76s)]
*  Can you imagine someone being like, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1887.52s)]
*  oh yeah, your father, your elderly father, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1888.6799999999998s)]
*  we couldn't carry him out of the house, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1892.8s)]
*  and he shouldn't have been in that house [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1894.24s)]
*  when it was burning down. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1895.6799999999998s)]
*  Or your daughter gets raped walking to school. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1896.52s)]
*  Well, she shouldn't have been wearing a skirt. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1898.12s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1899.32s)]
*  Which was all, what? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1900.3999999999999s)]
*  That's like the left campaign. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1902.12s)]
*  When I was in college, that was the whole, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1903.52s)]
*  don't blame the victim. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1905.3999999999999s)]
*  That was the whole thing. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1906.28s)]
*  Of course they're all. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1907.12s)]
*  Which I would kind of agree with, by the way. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1908.64s)]
*  I mean, you should be able to look attractive [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1910.24s)]
*  and not get raped. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1911.96s)]
*  Of course. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1912.92s)]
*  You should be allowed to be old and immobile [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1913.76s)]
*  and not die in a fire. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1914.96s)]
*  What are we even saying? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1916.24s)]
*  That's civilization. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1917.3600000000001s)]
*  It's civilization, exactly. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1918.52s)]
*  What's the point of civilization? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1920.72s)]
*  The point of civilization is to protect the vulnerable [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1922.24s)]
*  and to make it possible for people to reproduce [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1924.6s)]
*  and continue. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1927.08s)]
*  So make it possible for you to have kids [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1928.2s)]
*  and your kids to have kids. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1930.08s)]
*  There's no reason to have it other than that. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1931.04s)]
*  At the most basic level. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1932.8s)]
*  Yes, and so I don't understand, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1933.96s)]
*  how could she say something like that [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1935.84s)]
*  and not get fired or arrested? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1937.3999999999999s)]
*  She should have been fired as soon as that came out. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1939.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, and Gavin Newsom should have called for her [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1941.3999999999999s)]
*  to be fired. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1943.04s)]
*  The mayor should have called for her to be fired. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1943.8799999999999s)]
*  She's still in that job. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1944.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's dangerous. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1946.04s)]
*  Like it's a violation of firefighter ethics. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1949.12s)]
*  That person is a danger. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1952.08s)]
*  In other words, she's going around suggesting [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1954.24s)]
*  to all of her people that work for her [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1956.0s)]
*  that they're not responsible for saving. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1958.4399999999998s)]
*  But I think it reflects the mentality, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1960.6399999999999s)]
*  which is a nihilistic mentality, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1963.08s)]
*  which is that we don't belong here. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1964.4399999999998s)]
*  We stole this land. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1968.2s)]
*  And so, and this is this, let Malibu burn. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1970.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it is definitionally nihilism. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1974.16s)]
*  I mean, it's anti-civilization nihilism. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1977.92s)]
*  There's sort of two forms of nihilism. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1980.6399999999999s)]
*  One of them is basically anti-civilization, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1982.3999999999999s)]
*  anti-human, anti-modern life. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1985.32s)]
*  And it stems from this earlier nihilism, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1988.92s)]
*  which is that life has no meaning. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1991.36s)]
*  We're just like animals in the famous Russian novel, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1993.3999999999999s)]
*  Fathers and Sons by Turgerev, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1996.52s)]
*  the nihilistic character dissects a frog [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=1998.92s)]
*  and says, we're just like this frog. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2001.96s)]
*  We're just matter. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2004.6s)]
*  We're just dead matter, just this assemblage. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2006.32s)]
*  So it's a very dark nihilistic story [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2009.24s)]
*  that then leads to this just, yeah, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2011.8s)]
*  nihilistic anti-civilization ideology, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2016.3600000000001s)]
*  which became very fashionable. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2018.64s)]
*  I mean, City of Quartz, the Mike Davis book, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2019.84s)]
*  I mean, it was a very fashionable book to read [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2022.4s)]
*  in places like Pacific Palisades and Hollywood [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2025.56s)]
*  and Santa Monica and Venice. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2028.2s)]
*  So yeah, I think it's, I hope it's a wake-up call. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2031.4s)]
*  I don't know if it will be, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2035.4s)]
*  but it is a completely preventable disaster. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2037.24s)]
*  Fires are definitely not completely preventable, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2041.52s)]
*  but that level of destruction absolutely is. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2045.0s)]
*  And anybody who says that it is not preventable [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2047.72s)]
*  should be as far away from power as possible. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2051.36s)]
*  Anybody who believes that it was inevitable [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2054.24s)]
*  to lose 10,000 homes and buildings in Los Angeles [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2056.96s)]
*  over a week, they should not be in, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2060.96s)]
*  they should be very far away from political power. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2063.72s)]
*  They should not be in charge of any fire department [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2066.36s)]
*  because it ends up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2069.52s)]
*  So I've taken you right to 50,000 feet, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2071.72s)]
*  the future of the whites and all this stuff, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2074.3199999999997s)]
*  which I'm grateful that you addressed. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2076.36s)]
*  But just back to the, and I'm sorry for digressing so much, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2078.68s)]
*  back to the first question, how did this start? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2082.84s)]
*  You gave a great explanation. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2085.2000000000003s)]
*  Did climate change play a role? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2086.88s)]
*  Was this caused by climate change? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2088.88s)]
*  No, it's not caused by climate change. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2090.4s)]
*  I mean, certainly warmer weather's all else being equal [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2092.76s)]
*  makes the wood drier, but there is no change [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2095.92s)]
*  in precipitation over, since 1877, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2100.88s)]
*  they've kept very good records of rainfall, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2103.8s)]
*  annual rainfall in the Los Angeles basin, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2106.1600000000003s)]
*  and it's unchanged. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2108.6400000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2110.44s)]
*  I know, it's incredible. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2111.28s)]
*  There's wet years and dry years. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2112.2799999999997s)]
*  You look at it, I just posted on X, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2114.08s)]
*  it's just, people can go look at it, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2115.7999999999997s)]
*  it's from the Almanac. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2116.88s)]
*  No change in precipitation at all in Los Angeles. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2119.3599999999997s)]
*  There have been Santa Ana winds in January, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2123.44s)]
*  many times in the past, there have been, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2126.24s)]
*  and by the way, this is a dry year now, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2129.3199999999997s)]
*  but the last two years were very heavy rains. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2133.16s)]
*  Too heavy. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2135.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2136.7999999999997s)]
*  Much slide heavy. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2137.64s)]
*  Yeah, and so it's extremes. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2138.46s)]
*  That's why California's so beautiful, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2142.2400000000002s)]
*  it's a place of extremes, and so we adapt to that. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2143.52s)]
*  I mean, like. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2147.2400000000002s)]
*  But there's been no, in the aggregate, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2149.08s)]
*  change in rainfall in 140 years. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2150.84s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2153.48s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2155.48s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2156.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2157.14s)]
*  So why are they? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2157.98s)]
*  It's actually a remarkably stable climate. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2158.82s)]
*  Well, it is, I mean, anyone who's lived there [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2161.84s)]
*  can tell you that's its appeal. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2163.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2165.56s)]
*  It is a pretty stable climate, actually. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2166.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's stable climate [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2168.32s)]
*  with these amazing extremes. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2169.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, the best, I mean, for my favorite weather [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2172.08s)]
*  is after three days of just intense rains, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2174.7599999999998s)]
*  and you're just trying to make sure [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2178.3999999999996s)]
*  that your house isn't flooded, and the mud's everywhere, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2179.72s)]
*  it's just the dogs are bringing in mud, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2182.6s)]
*  and then the sun comes out, and it's just heaven on earth. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2184.8799999999997s)]
*  It's beyond. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2188.12s)]
*  I mean, that's why we're in California, right? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2188.96s)]
*  You're just like, ah. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2189.7999999999997s)]
*  So we love those extremes. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2191.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that's part of the, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2195.24s)]
*  I mean, it's so funny because it's like, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2196.7599999999998s)]
*  the reversion back to these, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2199.16s)]
*  people are cursing the weather. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2201.4s)]
*  They're blaming the weather. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2203.52s)]
*  That's why we do human sacrifice. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2206.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2207.48s)]
*  Well, another one was literally just before I got here, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2209.66s)]
*  the legislature got to its very important work [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2212.66s)]
*  of passing a bill just now that sets aside $50 million [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2214.8599999999997s)]
*  for California to sue Trump. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2220.48s)]
*  Like literally, and they were in a special session [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2222.92s)]
*  that they kept going. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2226.3199999999997s)]
*  They were in a special session to figure out [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2227.92s)]
*  how to sue Trump while LA is burning. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2230.56s)]
*  And meanwhile, Gavin's going out there all the time [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2233.88s)]
*  being like, oh, well, boy, it'd be really terrible [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2235.56s)]
*  if Trump withheld disaster aid or heaven forbid, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2237.6s)]
*  required that we get our shit together. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2242.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say it in your podcast, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2247.04s)]
*  get our things together. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2248.56s)]
*  And then literally he's like, we're gonna sue him [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2250.88s)]
*  for implementing the agenda he was elected on [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2253.12s)]
*  by a majority of the American people. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2255.56s)]
*  No, it's just an MSNBC agenda. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2256.92s)]
*  It's just a silly rich white liberal agenda. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2258.64s)]
*  And I will say I've thought for 20 years [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2260.84s)]
*  that California will only be saved [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2262.96s)]
*  by like Naib Bukele type figure. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2264.56s)]
*  Some authoritarian Latino in a cape is gonna show up [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2267.0s)]
*  and just impose order on the state. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2270.88s)]
*  And I'm not being, I am white, I'm not against whites. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2273.12s)]
*  I love whites, my children are white. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2275.2200000000003s)]
*  But the fact is they can't do it in that state. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2276.6s)]
*  Gavin Newsom can't do it. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2279.76s)]
*  The burden of guilt and self-hatred is too heavy. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2280.94s)]
*  And you're gonna get some guy from Oaxaca who's smart [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2284.0s)]
*  is gonna be like, we're not putting up [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2287.6s)]
*  any of this bullshit at all. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2288.6s)]
*  And no, you can't camp in LA. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2290.0s)]
*  No, you can't do meth in LA. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2291.68s)]
*  And yes, we are gonna have like full reservoir. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2293.2s)]
*  I mean, do you know what I mean? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2294.92s)]
*  You're gonna have it from Kelly. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2295.76s)]
*  It would be amazing if we had that. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2297.16s)]
*  I mean, there was sort of an idea that Karen Bass, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2298.64s)]
*  because she was black and because she came from the left, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2301.6s)]
*  would be able to do things [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2304.12s)]
*  that a white guy wouldn't be able to do. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2305.52s)]
*  That was part of the reasoning for her. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2307.0s)]
*  She didn't do it. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2310.12s)]
*  I mean, she's just, I mean, look, she's very, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2310.94s)]
*  people have to remember she's very radical. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2312.64s)]
*  I mean, and I get it. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2314.4s)]
*  I mean, I was like, I was there, I left it, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2315.3199999999997s)]
*  but she went to Cuba a bunch of times [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2317.52s)]
*  and like admired Castro and you kind of thought, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2320.08s)]
*  well, maybe that was behind her, but it's not. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2323.96s)]
*  It really isn't. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2326.16s)]
*  I mean, the thing where like, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2327.0s)]
*  you're like literally get a warning [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2328.3199999999997s)]
*  that the whole city is gonna go up in flames [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2329.62s)]
*  and you're like, oh, I really gotta be in Ghana [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2331.12s)]
*  for the inauguration of the new president. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2332.72s)]
*  I mean, look at where your head's at. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2334.92s)]
*  I mean, she talks about, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2336.96s)]
*  she just loves going to Africa all the time. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2338.0s)]
*  I love going to Africa, but- [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2339.12s)]
*  I do too. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2340.2799999999997s)]
*  You're like the mayor of like- [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2342.06s)]
*  It's just silly and selfish really. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2343.38s)]
*  It's really narcissistic. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2344.74s)]
*  It's really vapid. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2346.58s)]
*  So- [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2348.06s)]
*  It's not good to have people kiss your ass [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2348.9s)]
*  your whole life and tell you, I mean, that is just bad. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2350.5s)]
*  It's if it ever, when it happens to me, it's bad for me. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2352.7s)]
*  It's bad for anybody. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2355.42s)]
*  And if some people are always being like, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2356.5s)]
*  you've got black girl magic, like after a while, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2357.98s)]
*  no, I'm serious, cause there is no black girl magic. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2360.7s)]
*  There's no white man magic. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2362.7s)]
*  It's all bullshit actually. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2363.94s)]
*  But if you start to believe it, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2365.86s)]
*  having people kiss your ass, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2367.3399999999997s)]
*  having had many people kiss my ass, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2369.02s)]
*  I know corrodes your soul and makes you into a bad leader. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2370.22s)]
*  And I really think that's part of, we're seeing it, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2374.2599999999998s)]
*  not just in LA, but like the black girl magic thing [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2375.8999999999996s)]
*  has been bad for a lot of people. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2378.4199999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2379.98s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2380.8199999999997s)]
*  As the white man magic would be too. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2381.66s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2383.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, then she gets, I mean, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2384.22s)]
*  so the other thing was she did cut [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2386.06s)]
*  the fire department budget, okay? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2388.18s)]
*  She just cut it. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2389.9399999999996s)]
*  I mean, she just, it just happened. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2390.8599999999997s)]
*  And then literally- [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2392.98s)]
*  They're denying it. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2393.8199999999997s)]
*  I know, so she literally goes up at a press conference [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2394.66s)]
*  and it was word salad. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2397.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, it was quite impressive. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2398.58s)]
*  She was sort of like, you were like, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2399.8599999999997s)]
*  what did she just say? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2402.74s)]
*  I mean, she goes, well, that was, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2403.58s)]
*  it would kind of be like, well, that was different [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2406.4199999999996s)]
*  because we just approved this other money. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2407.74s)]
*  And she would basically just, was a non sequitur. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2410.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, she's describing a totally different [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2412.3799999999997s)]
*  salary negotiation. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2414.66s)]
*  They cut 17.5 million from the budget. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2415.74s)]
*  And not only that, but then they had this internal memo [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2418.9399999999996s)]
*  that leaked that said they were looking to cut [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2420.9399999999996s)]
*  another 48.8 million, another 49.8 million. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2423.1s)]
*  From the fire budget. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2426.8599999999997s)]
*  From the fire department, which had already [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2428.82s)]
*  was already decimated. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2430.5s)]
*  I mean, there's a whole story on this. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2432.7000000000003s)]
*  But it's Los Angeles, it's like famous for five years. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2433.54s)]
*  No, it's crazy. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2435.1800000000003s)]
*  So then like, so they do that. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2436.02s)]
*  And of course the LA Times and Politico [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2437.5800000000004s)]
*  and I can't remember other people, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2442.34s)]
*  they all come out and they go, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2443.9s)]
*  they go, did she cut the budget? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2444.98s)]
*  You know, it's complicated, you know? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2446.54s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing, you know? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2448.7400000000002s)]
*  It's complicated, which is like, yeah, yeah, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2452.1800000000003s)]
*  she did cut, she did cut the budget. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2453.9s)]
*  But nobody, the media was not being honest with people [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2455.86s)]
*  about what was really going on until the fire chief, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2459.2599999999998s)]
*  the lesbians, LA County fire chief, to her credit. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2462.34s)]
*  She was being, actually she was being grilled [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2466.7799999999997s)]
*  by a local Fox television reporter [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2469.14s)]
*  who was just doing a great job, actually. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2471.62s)]
*  I mean, just to be handed to the local TV, actually, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2473.22s)]
*  some of the best reporting still. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2475.42s)]
*  And she just- [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2477.42s)]
*  Only in LA, LA has always had great local television. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2478.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2482.3s)]
*  No, I think I agree with you, yeah. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2483.58s)]
*  It's fallen off in the Bay Area, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2486.06s)]
*  they did a little bit better on Oakland [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2487.3399999999997s)]
*  when things get really crazy. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2488.66s)]
*  But she just kept going after her. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2490.3799999999997s)]
*  She just kept asking her over and over again [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2491.98s)]
*  about the budget cuts. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2493.62s)]
*  And she was kind of having a high, finally, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2495.4199999999996s)]
*  she was just like, yeah, yeah, she did, she cut that money. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2496.7s)]
*  And she's like, and did it matter? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2499.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it mattered, you know? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2500.7799999999997s)]
*  She had sent a letter, I mean, there was a letter [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2502.3399999999997s)]
*  from, I think it was December 4th [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2504.8599999999997s)]
*  that the fire chief had sent, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2506.46s)]
*  which said specifically, this is gonna reduce our ability [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2509.1s)]
*  to deal with wildfires. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2512.02s)]
*  She said it twice. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2513.46s)]
*  Yes, she said it twice in the letter. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2514.46s)]
*  So it was a little bit like, okay, you were on the record [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2516.54s)]
*  saying it was gonna hurt you. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2518.18s)]
*  So, but then she was like, yes, yes, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2519.42s)]
*  it did hurt our ability to deal with it. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2521.2599999999998s)]
*  Then she just was like, I think at that point, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2524.22s)]
*  the fire chief, she was just like, all right, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2526.02s)]
*  like the gloves are off. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2528.66s)]
*  So she goes on CBS and on CNN and reiterates it. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2530.98s)]
*  And with very strong language, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2534.9s)]
*  ICE was able to get into this piece that will come out [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2537.58s)]
*  shortly, I was able to get into the weeds a little bit on it, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2540.9s)]
*  but basically there's a hundred fire trucks [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2544.06s)]
*  that are currently in the maintenance shop [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2547.22s)]
*  that just need to be fixed. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2550.86s)]
*  There's a hundred fire trucks missing. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2552.22s)]
*  The person I interviewed was like, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2554.46s)]
*  we could have bought for a hundred million dollars, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2556.58s)]
*  we could have bought, you know, like a hundred or 200, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2559.7799999999997s)]
*  you know, kind of used fire trucks or whatever, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2567.14s)]
*  just get fire trucks from wherever, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2569.2599999999998s)]
*  maintain them and just put them in different points [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2570.82s)]
*  all around the city. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2573.46s)]
*  You wouldn't necessarily have the staff to deal with them, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2574.7400000000002s)]
*  but you could then, as soon as you get that fire warning, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2578.38s)]
*  again, on January 1st to January 2nd, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2580.9s)]
*  you can just fly in firefighters from around the country, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2582.78s)]
*  from around the world. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2585.7400000000002s)]
*  You would just be like, look, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2586.62s)]
*  we're just gonna bring everybody in. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2587.46s)]
*  We don't know what's gonna happen. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2589.18s)]
*  And then they can just go, he was, this person was like, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2590.7400000000002s)]
*  you know, we could put like 30 of them at Dodger Stadium. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2592.62s)]
*  You know, you could just like put these fire trucks [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2594.82s)]
*  that are well maintained, you know. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2597.34s)]
*  But so she was like, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2598.58s)]
*  cause I didn't quite understand it either, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2599.7s)]
*  cause she was like, we didn't have the money [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2600.82s)]
*  for the mechanics. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2602.14s)]
*  And you're like, well, why do you, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2603.46s)]
*  like, what do you need the mechanics for? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2604.42s)]
*  Well, you need the mechanics to maintain the fire engines. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2605.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2608.42s)]
*  So, I mean, this is what, you know, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2609.2599999999998s)]
*  it's like when civilization breaks down, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2610.38s)]
*  it breaks down in like just a million small ways, you know. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2612.1s)]
*  So, you know, is there some DEI part of it? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2616.74s)]
*  Yeah, there was, they were promoting people [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2618.9s)]
*  not based on merit. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2620.5s)]
*  Is there budget cuts? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2622.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2623.74s)]
*  I mean, they didn't, you know, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2624.58s)]
*  and what goes wrong when you don't have those budget cuts? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2625.42s)]
*  Everything, you know, I mean, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2627.7799999999997s)]
*  the other complaint I've heard, you know, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2629.2999999999997s)]
*  is just that, it's just the advanced thinking. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2632.58s)]
*  It's just getting people that can kind of be thinking [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2634.8599999999997s)]
*  in advance, that's where their focus is, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2636.98s)]
*  that's where their priority is. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2638.62s)]
*  So the problem with the DEI is that [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2639.46s)]
*  when you're just orienting an entire organizational culture [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2641.62s)]
*  towards racial and sex quotas, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2644.3399999999997s)]
*  rather than towards, okay, you know, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2646.7799999999997s)]
*  what about the Santa Ana winds [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2648.8599999999997s)]
*  and the fire risk and whatever, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2650.42s)]
*  it's just, we all know that like, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2651.66s)]
*  it's not just time in the day, it's also mind time. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2654.42s)]
*  It's like, what do you think about when you take a shower? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2656.94s)]
*  What do you think about when you're putting on your shoes? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2658.62s)]
*  Like, where is your head at? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2660.3s)]
*  Their head has been in the clouds around, you know, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2662.0600000000004s)]
*  DEI, the Larger Society, ESG, climate, homelessness. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2665.54s)]
*  I mean, the list goes on and on, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2670.02s)]
*  but the, you know, it was on homelessness. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2672.5800000000004s)]
*  We now know, cause the state audit came out, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2675.3s)]
*  $24 billion on homelessness since Gavin took office in 2019. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2677.42s)]
*  Tucker, homelessness in California [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2684.7400000000002s)]
*  increased by 40% under Gavin. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2686.3s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2689.0600000000004s)]
*  So, cause everyone goes, it's such a curious, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2690.7400000000002s)]
*  it's such a curious mystery [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2694.5s)]
*  as to we spent all this money on homelessness [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2696.78s)]
*  and yet it just increased. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2700.34s)]
*  It's like, well, yeah, because you spent money [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2702.5s)]
*  incentivizing and subsidizing homelessness. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2704.78s)]
*  You spent all this money to attract people [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2707.38s)]
*  from all over the United States. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2709.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I interviewed people in California [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2711.14s)]
*  that are on the streets and it's like, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2713.1800000000003s)]
*  nobody's from California. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2714.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, they come in. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2715.82s)]
*  The only reason I feel like I have any understanding [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2717.26s)]
*  of what homelessness is is because of the interviews [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2720.5s)]
*  that you did several years ago, which are the most, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2721.54s)]
*  I never heard of you before I saw these interviews [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2723.66s)]
*  and you did, and I would recommend to our listeners [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2725.58s)]
*  to go find them cause they're on YouTube. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2728.1s)]
*  You did the thing that nobody, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2730.2599999999998s)]
*  I've never seen anybody do it before. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2731.3799999999997s)]
*  Others have followed since you did it, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2732.62s)]
*  but you just went and you interviewed the homeless. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2734.14s)]
*  They're like, what are you doing here? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2735.7s)]
*  Tell me your story. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2737.2599999999998s)]
*  And they were remarkably honest. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2738.1s)]
*  Oh, they're, they want to be. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2739.9399999999996s)]
*  They see the thing is like homeless people, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2741.3399999999997s)]
*  they're always lonely, you know? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2742.7799999999997s)]
*  And so they're, obviously these are people [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2744.1s)]
*  in a really bad way and they're eager to tell their story. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2746.7s)]
*  They have a lot to say. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2748.98s)]

*  and then the truth comes out. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2767.9s)]
*  So like you'll interview people and you'll be like, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2769.02s)]
*  you're like, where are you from brother? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2770.66s)]

*  And then you get like 30 minutes in the interview, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=2773.94s)]

*  Yeah, I grew up around this. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3044.06s)]
*  Classic, right. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3045.34s)]
*  That's like the greatest. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3046.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's like, and you realize it's essential [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3047.02s)]
*  to the functioning of civilization [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3048.9s)]
*  to have a bunch of disagreeable people running around [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3050.82s)]
*  asking impertinent questions. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3053.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3055.58s)]
*  So with this one, it was like, yeah. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3056.42s)]
*  So I mean, you basically get, like, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3057.98s)]
*  when you just look at the coverage of the fires, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3059.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it was like the reporters that are going out [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3061.66s)]
*  and doing it, it's like their whole thing is like, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3064.3799999999997s)]
*  oh, we've got to make sure that the right wing doesn't [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3065.66s)]
*  take advantage of this situation to push their, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3068.98s)]
*  like literally that's how they think about it. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3071.02s)]
*  So they're out there running cover for the, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3072.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing, you know? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3075.8199999999997s)]
*  Somebody did like a little meme on it, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3077.46s)]
*  but it's like that thing where it's like, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3078.8599999999997s)]
*  yeah, it used to be that the reporter would like [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3080.8199999999997s)]
*  be holding the microphone up to the politicians [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3082.58s)]
*  and being like, answer my questions. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3084.8199999999997s)]
*  And now they're like demanding that the people [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3086.1s)]
*  defend themselves for their terrible votes, you know? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3088.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like a complete reversal. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3091.8599999999997s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3093.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, they're the Praetorian guard for the powerful. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3094.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3096.2999999999997s)]
*  So, but one of the things I learned from your interviews [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3097.3399999999997s)]
*  with the homeless, which I just cannot recommend [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3100.18s)]
*  strongly enough as a primary source of information, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3103.06s)]
*  actual information, is the degree to which [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3105.22s)]
*  the narcotics fuel homelessness. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3107.8599999999997s)]
*  So you can't really disaggregate homelessness [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3110.62s)]
*  from drug addiction. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3112.18s)]
*  No, of course. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3113.02s)]
*  I mean, it's really- [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3114.62s)]
*  I mean, you say of course, but like- [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3115.46s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3116.5s)]
*  I wrote San Francisco because it was literally like, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3117.82s)]
*  because I knew drugs. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3120.7400000000002s)]
*  Me too. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3122.42s)]
*  I know drugs. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3123.26s)]
*  I made three friends from high school [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3124.1000000000004s)]
*  that became homeless addicts. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3125.42s)]
*  Two are dead. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3126.82s)]
*  It's like, I happily avoided personally all the hard ones, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3127.86s)]
*  but you saw your friends, like you'd leave you. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3133.7000000000003s)]
*  Wow, you guys have the same experience. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3135.6600000000003s)]
*  You had the same bath. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3136.5s)]
*  It's like, that's bad, guys. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3137.6600000000003s)]
*  What town did you go to high school in? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3138.82s)]
*  Greeley, Colorado. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3140.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3141.86s)]
*  So, my parents are psychologists. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3144.5s)]
*  I remember just being around, my aunt had schizophrenia. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3148.06s)]
*  I've told the story a million times, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3151.4199999999996s)]
*  so I don't want to bore you, but basically it was like, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3152.3799999999997s)]
*  it was just kind of like, so wait, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3154.58s)]
*  everyone just thinks that this is like a housing problem. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3156.2599999999998s)]
*  That's just crazy. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3158.7s)]
*  So, you sort of needed to, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3160.2999999999997s)]
*  I needed to go do all those interviews, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3162.18s)]
*  but I mean, really the first homelessness epidemic, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3163.62s)]
*  the first time that we're modern homelessness [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3166.02s)]
*  was in the early 80s, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3168.2999999999997s)]
*  and it was just, it was basically, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3170.4599999999996s)]
*  all it was was a combination of the emptying, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3172.74s)]
*  the final closure of all the mental hospitals [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3176.14s)]
*  where they literally, literally dumped people on the streets. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3178.38s)]
*  Like I thought that that was, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3181.06s)]
*  that sounded like an exaggeration when I first started. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3182.14s)]
*  They literally were putting, you know, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3183.94s)]
*  schizophrenics and stuff on the streets. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3185.2999999999997s)]
*  And then the crack epidemic, like that's all it was. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3187.2999999999997s)]
*  It was just those two things. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3189.66s)]
*  And then of course, then, you know, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3191.42s)]
*  left-wing mayor of San Francisco and others are like, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3193.02s)]
*  oh, well, we can't like, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3195.14s)]
*  we can't like require that people not camp outside. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3196.54s)]
*  They're poor. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3199.14s)]
*  The left in reaction to Reagan then took up homelessness [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3200.22s)]
*  as something that they claimed was caused by Reagan. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3205.14s)]
*  Like, I mean, he'd been in office for like, whatever, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3207.98s)]
*  two or three years, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3209.42s)]
*  and they would just make ridiculous claims, you know, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3210.24s)]
*  the Reagan budget, you know, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3212.22s)]
*  that's why it raised on the street. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3213.2599999999998s)]
*  So it really gets used, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3215.02s)]
*  so it becomes viewed by the left early on [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3216.58s)]
*  as a political propaganda tool. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3219.8599999999997s)]
*  I also blame the comics, by the way. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3222.5s)]
*  I mean, and just I'll name them, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3224.18s)]
*  Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3225.3399999999997s)]
*  They did this whole thing, you may remember comic relief, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3228.2999999999997s)]
*  where they framed the whole thing as a problem of poverty, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3230.8199999999997s)]
*  which is just, you know, it's just, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3234.18s)]
*  it's just such a disservice to the people on the street [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3236.1s)]
*  who need an intervention. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3238.58s)]
*  There's a natural, like when, for addicts, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3240.58s)]
*  there's a natural progression where you, you know, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3243.8199999999997s)]
*  whether from trauma or just because you enjoyed getting high, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3248.2599999999998s)]
*  your addiction gets in the way of your job [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3251.7799999999997s)]
*  and you stop going to work, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3254.66s)]
*  and you often, you know, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3256.18s)]
*  live at home with your parents or with friends. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3257.62s)]
*  You lie, steal and cheat from them repeatedly. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3259.98s)]
*  They give you multiple warnings. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3262.58s)]
*  They finally kick you out. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3264.58s)]
*  That's often the route to homelessness. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3266.02s)]
*  You end up on the street. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3268.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the moment where the society, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3270.02s)]
*  the parent, the family and friends [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3272.22s)]
*  were not able to impose an intervention. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3273.58s)]
*  So the way it should work is that you end up, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3275.98s)]
*  you go out camp on the street and the cop goes, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3278.42s)]
*  hey, you can't camp here. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3280.06s)]
*  It's illegal to camp here. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3281.06s)]
*  And they go, what am I supposed to do? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3282.54s)]
*  And they're like, well, we're gonna take you to jail [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3283.54s)]
*  or you can go to rehab. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3285.66s)]
*  Like those are your two choices, two choices. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3287.46s)]
*  A natural intervention is imposed in that situation. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3290.74s)]
*  What progressives and Democrats did for 40 years [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3293.9799999999996s)]
*  is they just removed the intervention [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3297.3799999999997s)]
*  in the name of compassion. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3299.74s)]
*  The most compassionate thing is to impose the intervention. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3301.56s)]
*  I mean, the thing that's most common, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3303.3799999999997s)]
*  I'll even find this with like harm reduction workers. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3305.06s)]
*  I was just with some harm reduction workers in Skid Row [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3307.2s)]
*  and one of them was telling me the whole usual thing. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3310.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, you can't make somebody get clean. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3313.2999999999997s)]
*  They have to hit their own bottom, like whatever. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3315.9599999999996s)]
*  And I was like, and they were like, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3318.3399999999997s)]
*  I used to run around here on meth. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3319.5s)]
*  It was an Asian American woman who was doing this. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3322.46s)]
*  And I was like, oh, wow. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3326.42s)]
*  I was like, what did it finally take for you to get clean? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3327.82s)]
*  She was like, well, I went to prison. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3329.66s)]
*  It's like, well, right. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3331.58s)]
*  I have a really close friend [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3333.22s)]
*  who's lived that same trajectory. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3334.74s)]
*  I have a couple of friends, but a very, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3336.0s)]
*  I have a legit close friend who's totally out of control [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3337.26s)]
*  on drugs and lost kids and all the things that happen [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3340.02s)]
*  when you're addicted and got sober in prison [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3343.12s)]
*  and rebuilt a life, a wonderful life. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3345.88s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3349.74s)]
*  And they're like the best, by the way, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3351.2999999999997s)]
*  the recovering addicts are like the greatest people. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3352.66s)]
*  I mean, they're the funniest, most honest people. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3354.8599999999997s)]
*  They have an equanimity about them. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3359.9399999999996s)]
*  I go to AA meetings when I can, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3361.66s)]
*  not because I'm in danger of partying again. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3363.62s)]
*  I'm not after 22 years, but because I like the people [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3365.5s)]
*  because they're so honest [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3368.3799999999997s)]
*  and they're honest about the one thing [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3369.8599999999997s)]
*  no one's ever honest about, which is themselves. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3372.18s)]
*  It's super easy to be honest about you. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3373.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't like your sweater, Mike. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3375.8599999999997s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3377.1s)]
*  Like, that's not hard. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3377.9199999999996s)]
*  That's not hard. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3379.0400000000004s)]
*  I've gained weight. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3380.38s)]
*  I'm wearing an ugly sweater. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3381.2200000000003s)]
*  Those are hard. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3382.42s)]
*  And you find among those people, the recovered people, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3383.76s)]
*  like a true honesty about themselves. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3387.28s)]
*  It's like the greatest church service there is. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3389.84s)]
*  Because they're all born again in an important sense. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3392.88s)]
*  They've all died in some way. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3395.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3397.0s)]
*  No, so that's the- [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3397.84s)]
*  But to deprive people of that [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3399.4s)]
*  and to encourage them to continue to use drugs [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3401.28s)]
*  and alcohol is like, I mean, don't even, I mean, whatever. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3404.9s)]
*  It's an interview of you, not me, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3408.2799999999997s)]
*  but I just feel like sobriety has to be the goal, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3409.2s)]
*  not just for the individual, but for the society [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3412.44s)]
*  that really believe that. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3414.96s)]
*  So sobriety is the greatest gift. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3416.08s)]
*  A. B. Use of drugs and alcohol causes mental illness, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3418.24s)]
*  which nobody ever says out loud. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3422.16s)]
*  I've seen it, to some extent experienced it. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3423.6s)]
*  I know you can cause severe mental illness [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3426.64s)]
*  by using drugs and alcohol. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3430.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, right? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3431.44s)]
*  Is that even controversial? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3432.2799999999997s)]
*  It shouldn't be. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3433.3599999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3434.4s)]
*  I mean, you've done more on this than I have, much more, but- [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3435.24s)]
*  It's sort of coming back a little bit. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3437.6s)]
*  People talk about meth-induced psychosis now more, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3439.16s)]
*  but yeah, it's really- [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3441.68s)]
*  And weed-induced psychosis. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3444.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, and the weed now, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3445.92s)]
*  it's just so potent and dangerous and yeah. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3447.16s)]
*  So, but you, as someone who still lives in California, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3450.96s)]
*  does anybody, do you ever hear people say that? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3453.56s)]
*  Like, why are we paying people to use drugs? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3455.6s)]
*  Like, should it surprise us that things are falling apart? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3457.92s)]
*  I mean, I do think that the conversation has changed a bit. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3460.24s)]
*  I'll take some credit for it with San Francisco [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3464.62s)]
*  and the videos in particular, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3466.7s)]
*  but yeah, it's just still that thing where it's like, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3469.58s)]
*  they kind of go, but yeah, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3471.66s)]
*  but there's a black woman running for mayor. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3472.54s)]
*  And it just, it's like the singularity. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3474.5s)]
*  It's like, when I always say that, it's like this, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3476.1s)]
*  it's just hovering over people. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3477.98s)]
*  And of course- It's a race thing. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3480.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's really about race in a really important sense. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3481.62s)]
*  And then the guilt- [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3487.42s)]
*  It's like the dealers are all immigrants [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3488.2599999999998s)]
*  from Central America. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3489.8599999999997s)]
*  We can't do anything about it. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3490.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3491.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, sanctuary state, sanctuary city. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3492.66s)]
*  That's part of what they're gonna sue on. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3494.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that it's just, yeah, it's a big trap. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3497.94s)]
*  I mean, I think that it's funny because, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3501.02s)]
*  we're a guilt culture. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3503.1400000000003s)]
*  And so, like Japan's a shame culture [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3504.46s)]
*  and guilt is this incredibly important part [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3507.6200000000003s)]
*  of the Christian tradition. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3510.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3512.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, you stop believing in original sin [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3513.5s)]
*  and you stop believing in Christianity. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3516.46s)]
*  Apparently there's still this deep desire [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3518.2200000000003s)]
*  to feel that guilt and to sort of show it [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3520.3s)]
*  as well. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3525.3s)]
*  In other words, it is a social part of it. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3526.1400000000003s)]
*  People wanted to see in that focus, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3527.1000000000004s)]
*  they wanted other people to see in that focus group [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3528.86s)]
*  that they felt guilty. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3530.54s)]
*  It was very important to them. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3532.3s)]
*  But what's interesting is so in traditional Christianity [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3533.1400000000003s)]
*  and other religions, the guilty person repents atones, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3535.86s)]
*  dons ashes, those sackcloth and covers himself in ashes [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3543.1000000000004s)]
*  as a way of saying, I am worthy of the degradation. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3547.1400000000003s)]
*  But we've kind of transferred that. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3550.54s)]
*  It's almost like the homeless are in sackcloth and ashes. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3552.86s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3556.34s)]
*  Like I live in the palisades, I produce music videos, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3557.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm doing pretty well, but I still feel guilt. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3560.1s)]
*  So, but like seeing somebody like, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3562.1s)]
*  riding on the sidewalk, I'm like displacing my atonement. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3564.42s)]
*  Wow, that's really interesting. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3567.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3568.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, then they talk about it that way. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3569.7000000000003s)]
*  Even when you talk to the activists that justify it, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3571.54s)]
*  they're like, well, that's a, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3574.1800000000003s)]
*  those people are suffering because of capitalism. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3575.6600000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3578.1s)]
*  And slavery and- [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3578.94s)]
*  But the whole point of Christianity is, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3580.86s)]
*  you suffer, you confess your sin. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3582.38s)]
*  You don't put it off on some junkie. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3586.8199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3588.86s)]
*  Well, it's the part of it that's just really satanic. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3589.7s)]
*  I mean, not to be theological about it, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3591.18s)]
*  but it's just a complete reversal [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3593.14s)]
*  of the traditional Christian process. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3594.98s)]
*  It's just, yeah, it's exactly, it's making other people- [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3598.02s)]
*  Atone for your sins. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3601.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3602.14s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3603.86s)]
*  It's so bad. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3605.3399999999997s)]
*  And they're sort of on display. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3606.18s)]
*  You know, it's the, it's really, if you kind of read it, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3607.94s)]
*  I mean, it's like, they want it to be on display. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3611.14s)]
*  They want to sort of show it. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3615.74s)]
*  And that's why they insist that they not be arrested [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3617.54s)]
*  or mandated treatment. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3620.66s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3623.7s)]
*  It is like, you know, like you go to Skid Row [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3624.7s)]
*  and it's still like a Hieronymus, is it Hieronymus Bosch painting? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3626.62s)]
*  You know, it's just like, you just can't, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3629.8199999999997s)]
*  you still can't believe it. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3631.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, you still can't believe [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3632.5s)]
*  there's a person lying there, you know, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3633.98s)]
*  sweating profusely, passed out. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3636.8599999999997s)]
*  You can't tell if they're alive or dead. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3638.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know, like, do I do an intervention? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3639.62s)]
*  And it's just, it's really breaking down. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3642.54s)]
*  These are human beings. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3645.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know, that's, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3646.54s)]
*  I'm not a particularly compassionate or kind person. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3647.46s)]
*  I'm kind of a dick actually. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3649.5s)]
*  But even I, like, whenever I see that, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3650.66s)]
*  I feel such deep sadness for the person. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3652.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like heartbreaking. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3655.98s)]
*  Of course. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3657.1s)]
*  If that was my child, would I allow it? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3658.18s)]
*  Now for one second, I would take that child [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3660.3399999999997s)]
*  and chain him to the fucking radiator until he got better. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3663.06s)]
*  I would not allow that. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3665.18s)]
*  My child. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3666.7s)]
*  It's a healthy response, by the way. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3667.7s)]
*  Absolutely it is. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3669.54s)]
*  Absolutely it is. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3670.98s)]

*  So okay, so there are in LA County 78, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3729.78s)]
*  how many fire departments? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3732.34s)]
*  Well, there's 88 cities and there's 29 fire departments [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3733.34s)]
*  in county and the county. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3736.26s)]
*  No, no, no, that's fine. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3737.1s)]
*  But yeah, so like literally, like once the fire starts, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3738.86s)]
*  I didn't even understand this until I started [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3742.62s)]
*  investigating it. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3744.6600000000003s)]
*  The county fire chief has to call all these cities [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3745.6600000000003s)]
*  and be like, hey, can you send a couple of trucks? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3748.94s)]
*  We're putting together a strike team. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3750.94s)]
*  Can you send some engines or whatever? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3753.8199999999997s)]
*  And they have to call around and they're like, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3754.66s)]
*  okay, we're all gonna meet. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3755.94s)]
*  The fire's like blazing away and they're like, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3756.7799999999997s)]
*  okay, well, we're all gonna meet wherever, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3759.7s)]
*  Sepulveda or whatever the streets are in LA. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3762.7799999999997s)]
*  We'll meet in this place and we'll get together [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3766.02s)]
*  and we'll sync the radios and we'll develop a plan. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3767.9s)]
*  I mean, this is all happening like while the city's burning. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3771.54s)]
*  I mean, it's madness, right? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3774.06s)]
*  The other thing is, I mean, there's like most- [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3776.2599999999998s)]
*  So they didn't have any preparation for this? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3778.62s)]
*  There's nothing, man. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3780.7s)]
*  I mean, there might've been something that we, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3781.7s)]
*  but obviously if there was, it wasn't enough. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3783.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's a little bit like when they go, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3786.2999999999997s)]
*  when the people that are like, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3788.3799999999997s)]
*  when the nihilists are defending what happened, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3789.7799999999997s)]
*  they're like, well, there was nothing else [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3793.22s)]
*  we could have done or we did everything we could have. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3794.3399999999997s)]
*  It's like, well, no, obviously you didn't. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3795.62s)]
*  Like, it doesn't matter what it is. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3797.4199999999996s)]
*  It obviously was, there's only one right answer, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3799.9399999999996s)]
*  which is that you didn't do enough. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3802.46s)]
*  The fatalism, you know, it's a, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3806.98s)]
*  it's a way to disavow responsibility on the one hand. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3811.8599999999997s)]
*  Again, I think it expresses that nihilism, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3814.62s)]
*  but I think it's like people just have been out of practice, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3816.7799999999997s)]
*  but you have to, this is part of the journalism too, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3819.5s)]
*  you know, is that you kind of, it has to be like, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3822.06s)]
*  no, no, we're not accepting that as an answer. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3824.2599999999998s)]
*  Like the right attitude for the journalist [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3826.7s)]
*  is to basically be no excuses. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3829.4199999999996s)]
*  Of course. It makes for like, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3831.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, maybe the journalists are being too much [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3832.8599999999997s)]
*  of a hard ass and too much of a dick about it, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3835.18s)]
*  and maybe they need to be a little bit whatever. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3836.8599999999997s)]
*  That's fine, that's their role. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3838.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like, your role is to be the prosecutor against the, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3840.1s)]
*  on the case of the failure. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3844.74s)]
*  Of course. Your role is to be [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3846.06s)]
*  the investigator. You're the public defender. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3846.9s)]
*  Yeah, the public defender, the prosecutor, the, you know, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3848.2999999999997s)]
*  but your point is to be like, oh no, that can't be right. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3851.18s)]
*  So, because when they go, well, we ran out of water. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3853.42s)]
*  Well, why'd you run out of water? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3855.38s)]
*  Well, there wasn't enough water. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3856.98s)]
*  No, well, why wasn't it? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3858.02s)]
*  Well, because actually to not one of the reservoirs [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3858.98s)]
*  didn't have any water. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3860.58s)]
*  Isn't it your job to make sure there's enough water? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3861.42s)]
*  You know, I mean, and this is what they do [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3863.1s)]
*  when they go after Trump and stuff, is that like, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3864.9s)]
*  because Trump will often be like, directionally correct. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3867.38s)]
*  Right. You know, like, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3870.2200000000003s)]
*  oh, but Trump was referring to the wrong kind of reservoir. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3871.26s)]
*  You know, the other reservoirs were full. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3874.6600000000003s)]
*  It's like, okay, fine, but the reservoir [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3877.58s)]
*  right next to the Pacific Palisades was empty. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3880.1400000000003s)]
*  So, you know, the basic intuition, which is, I think, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3882.78s)]
*  I often talk about the importance of, you know, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3886.98s)]
*  like if you're defending civilization, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3888.7400000000002s)]
*  it's a physical thing, right? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3890.3s)]
*  So I'm always thinking to myself as like, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3891.94s)]
*  like there's a physicalism in my worldview, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3894.1800000000003s)]
*  which is like, okay, that's a person, that's a body. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3898.06s)]
*  You need to, they need to, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3901.66s)]
*  they're in somewhere they shouldn't be. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3903.8999999999996s)]
*  They need to be somewhere else. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3905.2999999999997s)]
*  So we can have a debate about [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3906.5s)]
*  how to move them somewhere else. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3907.4599999999996s)]
*  That's a totally reasonable debate to have, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3908.8199999999997s)]
*  but they can't be there. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3910.3799999999997s)]
*  They can't be there because they're creating fires, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3911.8199999999997s)]
*  they're breaking the law, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3913.66s)]
*  they're hurting themselves and others. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3914.54s)]
*  Similarly, there wasn't water there. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3916.54s)]
*  There needed to be more water. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3919.9399999999996s)]
*  And if you go, okay, well, we actually, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3920.8999999999996s)]
*  let's say that they had all the reservoirs, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3922.58s)]
*  the potable water reservoirs. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3925.3799999999997s)]
*  Let's say they had all been full [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3927.78s)]
*  and they'd still run out of water. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3928.62s)]
*  Well, then there was some other problem [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3929.46s)]
*  you needed to solve. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3930.98s)]
*  Maybe you needed more reservoirs [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3931.82s)]
*  or maybe you needed the preparation there. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3933.1s)]
*  So you just have to have, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3935.86s)]
*  I mean, you know, the Bukele type [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3938.1s)]
*  that you'd want to see or somebody, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3939.5s)]
*  you just have to have something that's just like, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3941.14s)]
*  literally no excuses all the way down the line. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3942.58s)]
*  But when you say there's a, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3945.3s)]
*  I feel like you're on something super important, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3946.66s)]
*  if you could flesh it out, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3949.02s)]
*  you say there's a physicalism to your worldview. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3949.86s)]
*  Contrast that with the worldview currently in power. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3952.94s)]
*  Oh, well, this is, yeah, this is exactly, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3955.7799999999997s)]
*  it's like, first of all, it's like, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3957.58s)]
*  I mean, it's just so symbolic. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3959.9799999999996s)]
*  It's the city of angels, you know? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3961.4199999999996s)]
*  So it's like, we're up here and you want it, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3963.58s)]
*  like the wealthier you get in LA, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3965.8199999999997s)]
*  and I guess with some exceptions like Venice Beach, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3967.3399999999997s)]
*  but mostly you're getting up higher. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3969.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3970.8199999999997s)]
*  You're moving up, up, up, up, up. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3971.66s)]
*  You're trying to get away from- [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3972.9399999999996s)]
*  To the cliffs of Malibu. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3973.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and you end up in the heavens [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3975.14s)]
*  and people talk about, I live in a little tree house. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3976.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I get it, I love it. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3978.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like, I live in the Berkeley Hills. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3979.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm not like, you know, but it's like, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3981.06s)]
*  I'm above all that, I'm away from all that. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3983.3799999999997s)]
*  Like, I'm connected to nature up here, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3985.3399999999997s)]
*  but also, you know, away from all the, you know, the plebes. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3987.8599999999997s)]
*  And so you actually, I think they do, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3991.3399999999997s)]
*  it's that whole thing, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3992.8199999999997s)]
*  we talk about people being a bubble, you know? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3993.66s)]
*  I mean, it's like the most bubbly place in the world, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3995.3799999999997s)]
*  except for that it's not, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3998.4199999999996s)]
*  and you're in a massive fire zone [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=3999.7799999999997s)]
*  that must be constantly managed. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4002.22s)]
*  There's consequences of living in these spectacular places, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4004.74s)]
*  but you've got people that are, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4008.2999999999997s)]
*  the whole industry is a fantasy industry. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4010.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's just exist to construct a fantasy reality. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4013.5800000000004s)]
*  And yeah, you would hope that people would be able [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4017.2200000000003s)]
*  to compartmentalize. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4020.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, my day job is constructing fantasies [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4022.1000000000004s)]
*  that we charge, you know, $20 to stream. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4023.9s)]
*  But I know that when I go home, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4027.78s)]
*  that like all the brush has to be cleared around my house [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4029.42s)]
*  and I have to vote for candidates that are physicalists. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4031.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, look at- Physicalists? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4036.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if that's the right word. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4037.38s)]
*  There's something there, right? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4039.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4041.58s)]
*  So important. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4042.4199999999996s)]
*  They're fantasyists. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4044.22s)]
*  I mean, they're the people, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4045.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I don't wanna use the word idealist [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4046.22s)]
*  because there's too many other connotations to it, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4048.02s)]
*  but it's just a difference between being your heads up [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4049.9399999999996s)]
*  in the clouds and also, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4053.8599999999997s)]
*  as opposed to just being really, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4055.22s)]
*  you need the firefighter view of the world. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4057.22s)]
*  You need the cop view of the world. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4059.8999999999996s)]
*  Frankly, you need the homeless guys view. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4062.06s)]
*  The homeless people like live in a, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4063.58s)]
*  I mean, they're high a lot, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4065.8199999999997s)]
*  so they're switching in and out, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4066.98s)]
*  but they have to get their physical needs met. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4068.06s)]
*  You know, there's just a, yeah, so it's- [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4070.94s)]
*  When we first had kids, I remember my wife being, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4073.18s)]
*  and I had much lower standards, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4076.54s)]
*  but insistent on the house being clean and orderly. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4077.62s)]
*  And I remember saying like, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4081.18s)]
*  the point of having kids is to instill values in them. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4083.58s)]
*  She goes, yeah, but one of the values [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4085.98s)]
*  is like order and cleanliness. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4087.58s)]
*  And like, they will feel like things are out of control [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4088.74s)]
*  if the house isn't clean and orderly. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4093.62s)]
*  And she's really insistent on that. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4095.58s)]
*  And we've lived that way our whole lives. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4097.34s)]
*  And it's a version of what you're saying. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4098.74s)]
*  It's like, you can tell your kids about honesty [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4102.02s)]
*  and decency and compassion and high achievement or whatever, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4104.74s)]
*  but like, someone has to make the bed and vacuum the floor [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4107.9400000000005s)]
*  if there's dog shit in the kitchen, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4110.74s)]
*  like it has to be cleaned up. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4112.18s)]
*  Like, she understood that and has imposed it [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4113.7s)]
*  to great effect, I would say. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4116.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4118.34s)]
*  No, I think that's right. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4119.26s)]
*  And also like parents, we all, I did it too, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4120.14s)]
*  so I'm not like judging, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4121.9800000000005s)]
*  but like we talk too much to the kids. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4123.14s)]
*  Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4124.82s)]
*  And you see like new parents talking to their kid [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4126.14s)]
*  and the kid's like, what? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4128.54s)]
*  It's like the peanuts is right. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4129.780000000001s)]
*  Like the whole, what they hear is a wah wah wah wah. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4131.1s)]
*  As opposed to like, could you set the table? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4134.5s)]
*  You know, like the kids like, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4140.02s)]
*  I mean, the kids like to have a job. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4141.62s)]
*  They wanna have a chore. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4144.18s)]
*  Chores are super, like kids love that. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4145.54s)]
*  You know, and so you're teaching the kids [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4148.5s)]
*  to clean the classroom every morning. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4151.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, the problem is the specialization [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4153.700000000001s)]
*  and the wealth, they sort of get disconnected from it. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4155.54s)]
*  We talk too much to the kids. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4157.46s)]
*  Do you know what I mean though? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4159.14s)]
*  That's why I'm laughing. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4159.98s)]
*  And dogs too, people deal with their dogs. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4161.1s)]
*  You ever see people with like, they're like, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4163.22s)]
*  whatever, I live in the Berkeley Hills, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4165.42s)]
*  it's like older ladies and their dogs [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4166.42s)]
*  and they're just like saying blah, blah, blah, blah, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4168.26s)]
*  but the dogs, it's like, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4170.1s)]
*  well, you're not holding the leash tight enough, lady. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4170.94s)]
*  You rewarded the dog when he did something bad. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4175.34s)]
*  You should have rewarded it when it came to you. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4177.86s)]
*  Anyway, so all these things break down, all these norms. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4179.74s)]
*  It's so deep and true. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4183.1s)]
*  You just said you're a physicalist. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4184.780000000001s)]
*  I want that to become intercom and usage [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4187.660000000001s)]
*  because I think that is really, really important. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4190.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's because it's like, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4193.580000000001s)]
*  people will say things like practical, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4195.1s)]
*  which is good and pragmatic, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4196.780000000001s)]
*  but some pragmatic got started to mean things [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4198.620000000001s)]
*  like making shitty political compromises. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4200.820000000001s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4203.18s)]
*  Or it's an American linguistic tradition [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4204.820000000001s)]
*  or a philosophical tradition, but yeah, physicalist. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4206.780000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, somebody's gotta clean up all the, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4209.02s)]
*  you know, if you have all the homeless people, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4211.14s)]
*  you're gonna have to spend millions of dollars [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4212.38s)]
*  on cleaning up crap all the time. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4214.18s)]
*  And you know, the homeless, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4217.14s)]
*  one of the things you probably have observed [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4218.34s)]
*  is that I think it's probably a compensating mechanism, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4220.7s)]
*  but they're just, they're obsessed with collecting [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4223.9800000000005s)]
*  tons and tons of garbage, basically. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4226.34s)]
*  So you'll clean up these homeless encampments [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4228.46s)]
*  and you'll be like, oh, wow. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4230.62s)]
*  They're not minimalists. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4231.9400000000005s)]
*  No, no, they're not living the Zen lifestyle. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4232.9400000000005s)]
*  Banging Olfson life, it's like very much. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4236.22s)]
*  No, no, it's very cluttered. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4239.02s)]
*  And so they're probably over, but so yeah, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4241.34s)]
*  I mean, they need, you need to, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4242.900000000001s)]
*  we need to reimpose some limits. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4244.5s)]
*  You know, there's a, I'm also, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4247.1s)]
*  I just became really obsessed with this scholar [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4248.18s)]
*  I just discovered who wrote a trilogy on nationalism [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4250.22s)]
*  named Leah Greenfeld. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4253.46s)]
*  Highly recommend her books. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4255.1s)]
*  Her first book is called Nationalism. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4256.58s)]
*  Second book is called Spirit of Capitalism. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4258.02s)]
*  And the third book is called Mind, Madness and Modernity. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4260.34s)]
*  And these books are just incredible, but basically- [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4264.1s)]
*  LEAH. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4266.5s)]
*  It's actually L-I-A-H and then Greenfeld. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4267.74s)]
*  Common spelling. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4272.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4274.06s)]
*  L-I-A-H. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4274.9s)]
*  L-I-A-H, yeah, she's a Russian, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4276.02s)]
*  I think she's a Russian Jew who went to Israel, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4278.58s)]
*  lived in Israel for a long time. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4280.78s)]
*  And then her mentor was Edward Shills, the sociologist. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4282.18s)]
*  So she's a sociologist, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4288.3s)]
*  but the Nationalism book is beautiful. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4289.5s)]
*  I mean, it's like the famous book on nationalism [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4291.42s)]
*  is called Imaginary Communities by Benedict Anderson. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4295.3s)]
*  And he's a Marxist. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4297.38s)]
*  And so it's all the whole things like him trying to explain [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4298.74s)]
*  how nationalism, why it's so powerful [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4300.94s)]
*  when Marx thought it should wither away. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4302.86s)]
*  And, but she describes, so she defines nationalism, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4305.74s)]
*  the picture that people have of nationalism [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4309.14s)]
*  is completely wrong. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4310.9800000000005s)]
*  She describes nationalism as a sovereign community [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4312.26s)]
*  of fundamentally equal individuals [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4316.06s)]
*  who have a shared identity. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4318.5s)]
*  And so she's like, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4320.3s)]
*  nationalism is fundamentally democratic. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4321.22s)]
*  Now you might have some systems that are nationalist, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4324.46s)]
*  but they don't have proper democracy. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4326.820000000001s)]
*  But really the basic idea is that egalitarian idea [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4329.14s)]
*  that we're Americans, we live here, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4331.780000000001s)]
*  we have the same solidarity. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4333.14s)]
*  I've also become, I'll come back to the Greenfeld, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4335.1s)]
*  but I've also been obsessed with Hannah Arendt, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4338.58s)]
*  who I had never read until recently. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4340.42s)]
*  And she points out- [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4342.66s)]
*  I don't think you're allowed to read her anymore. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4343.5s)]
*  And well, I know, well, she was canceled. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4344.9800000000005s)]
*  I know, I discovered she was canceled. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4346.74s)]
*  I love Hannah Arendt, so I, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4348.78s)]
*  but I didn't realize just like Freud, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4350.3s)]
*  who was also a huge figure in my childhood, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4352.58s)]
*  everyone talked about Freud, alluded to Freud. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4354.7s)]
*  And then he just kind of disappeared one day. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4357.66s)]
*  And Hannah Arendt, same thing. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4359.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah, totally canceled, but it's brilliant. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4360.98s)]
*  She's too honest. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4364.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, yeah, yeah, she was very, well, it's really in, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4365.099999999999s)]
*  I read her two books, one is the Ante-Toletarianism book [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4368.7s)]
*  and the other one is Eichmann in Jerusalem. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4371.46s)]
*  Eichmann in Jerusalem, it's rough [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4373.219999999999s)]
*  because she describes how the Jewish council- [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4374.98s)]
*  It is rough. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4376.94s)]
*  Participated in the Nazis. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4377.78s)]
*  I mean, that was what was really controversial. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4379.259999999999s)]
*  But what really blew me away from reading Hannah Arendt, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4382.0599999999995s)]
*  because I was coming to the nationalism conversation. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4386.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, I should, I've self-confession [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4388.58s)]
*  because I should have been reading [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4390.9s)]
*  nationalism starting in 2016. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4391.74s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4393.46s)]
*  But you know, I finally was reading on it [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4394.3s)]
*  and it was like, she was like, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4395.94s)]
*  nationalism is a barrier to totalitarianism [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4397.54s)]
*  because totalitarianism is attempting to destroy [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4400.66s)]
*  all relationships between people [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4403.94s)]
*  other than the relationship with the state. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4405.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4406.98s)]
*  And so religion, nationalism, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4407.82s)]
*  the classic de Tocqueville associative ties. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4411.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4414.379999999999s)]
*  All of that is a threat to totalitarianism. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4415.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4417.219999999999s)]
*  And so that really struck me. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4418.0599999999995s)]
*  And Leah Greenfield kind of, she has a, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4421.299999999999s)]
*  I just interviewed her, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4423.66s)]
*  she has like a difference of opinion with, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4424.5s)]
*  Arendt on this issue. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4429.179999999999s)]
*  But nonetheless, I was just struck by how, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4430.139999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the right, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4435.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm just like, for me, like nationalism, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4435.9s)]
*  because I come from the left, from the radical left. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4438.339999999999s)]
*  And we would code our socialist yearnings [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4440.5s)]
*  as the public interest. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4444.179999999999s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4445.58s)]
*  You know, Ralph Nader kind of took all of the Chomsky [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4446.42s)]
*  and left-wing views of the early 60s [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4449.139999999999s)]
*  and packaged them for moderate, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4450.7s)]
*  he kind of made it all seem very reasonable, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4452.62s)]
*  and the environmentalists did the same thing. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4455.58s)]
*  So the brilliance of the left in general, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4457.259999999999s)]
*  but the radical left in particular, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4460.94s)]
*  was of just cross-dressing as mainstream issues. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4462.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4466.099999999999s)]
*  So it became, so really what is a socialist movement [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4466.94s)]
*  became a consumer rights public interest, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4471.62s)]
*  the women's rights movement. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4474.26s)]
*  Yep. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4475.86s)]
*  And you get these really radical ideologies. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4476.7s)]
*  I mean, I'm just obsessed with this, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4479.0199999999995s)]
*  the ways in which like, so Marxism, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4481.9s)]
*  look back on it, I was like, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4484.74s)]
*  wow, I can't believe the things I believed in. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4485.58s)]
*  Marxism has this idea that the capitalists, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4487.0199999999995s)]
*  like what's distinct about them [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4490.7s)]
*  is that they're just super greedy, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4492.14s)]
*  and they're thieves, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4495.3s)]
*  and that they're stealing from their workers. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4496.660000000001s)]
*  And there's really no difference between the entrepreneur, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4498.820000000001s)]
*  the capital's entrepreneur, like Elon Musk, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4501.42s)]
*  or Thomas Edison, or Henry Ford, and their workers. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4503.3s)]
*  They're just meaner, and they steal from them. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4506.22s)]
*  And it's like, it's just an amazingly audacious lie, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4508.740000000001s)]
*  because whenever you go and actually study an entrepreneur, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4511.860000000001s)]
*  what's incredible is that it's not just that they are doing, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4515.34s)]
*  it's not like they're the best at what they're doing. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4518.22s)]
*  They're the best at like 12 different things. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4520.38s)]
*  You may remember when Trump and Elon [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4522.900000000001s)]
*  were beginning their bromance, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4525.18s)]
*  Trump goes, he goes, you know what I asked Elon, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4527.14s)]
*  I was like, what is that you're really good at? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4529.46s)]
*  You know, you can see it was like probably a question [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4531.3s)]
*  that Trump is used to asking people [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4532.54s)]
*  that he interviews for a job or something. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4533.86s)]
*  And he goes, turned out it was a lot of different things. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4535.58s)]
*  You know, and it's like, well, yeah, like, I mean, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4538.62s)]
*  because of course, like with Thomas Edison, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4541.38s)]
*  people go, oh, we invented the light bulb. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4542.74s)]
*  He didn't invent the light bulb, he improved it. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4543.74s)]
*  He invented a viable economic model [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4546.22s)]
*  for electricity production. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4549.38s)]
*  I mean, he invented the electrical grid. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4551.02s)]
*  He found the customers. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4552.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that impresses me so much [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4555.14s)]
*  with Elon is like, I'll see him, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4556.9800000000005s)]
*  you'll see him out there and he'll be selling, you know, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4559.820000000001s)]
*  which is kind of, I mean, selling is sort of the worst part [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4562.5s)]
*  of our jobs in some ways. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4565.1s)]
*  I mean, you can do it with pleasure [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4566.26s)]
*  and you can do it with verve and stuff, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4567.62s)]
*  but you know, you're kind of like, and I do it. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4569.02s)]
*  I mean, I'm always like, subscribe now, you know, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4570.9400000000005s)]
*  and you're like, you have to do it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4572.820000000001s)]
*  Like, it's part of the work, but I'm always like, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4574.02s)]
*  wow, Elon is still, he's the richest man in the world. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4575.78s)]
*  He's probably, he may be the greatest innovator [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4578.22s)]
*  in American history, certainly top three. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4581.06s)]
*  And he's still out there having to hawk his products [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4584.9800000000005s)]
*  and he does it great. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4588.1s)]
*  He's an amazing job of it. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4589.46s)]
*  He like, one of the innovations was, you know, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4590.54s)]
*  he just become the biggest user of Twitter [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4592.46s)]
*  rather than buying paid ads. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4594.82s)]
*  But so this gigantic lie from Marx, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4597.18s)]
*  which is that the, first of all, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4600.02s)]
*  the entrepreneur, the capitalist is just a meaner version [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4602.42s)]
*  of the worker as opposed to this genius, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4606.42s)]
*  you know, this Shumpeterian genius. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4608.1s)]
*  And Shumpeter comes along and then his, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4611.38s)]
*  the other thing, the big lie, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4613.06s)]
*  and then Shumpeter points it out, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4614.5s)]
*  is that the owner of the company and the workers [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4616.3s)]
*  have the same fundamental interest. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4619.3s)]
*  In other words, Elon Musk's employees [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4621.46s)]
*  and Elon have the same interest. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4623.9s)]
*  They want to expand their markets [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4625.78s)]
*  and want to expand their products. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4627.38s)]
*  So to put them opposed, it's just so, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4629.06s)]
*  it's just so dishonest and it's so reminiscent of what, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4632.0199999999995s)]
*  you can say feminism or radical feminism, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4636.94s)]
*  but this idea that the interests of women [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4639.259999999999s)]
*  are opposed by men, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4642.179999999999s)]
*  that women and men have different interests. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4644.179999999999s)]
*  And of course you trace it back, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4646.86s)]
*  it all goes back to Simone de Beauvoir, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4648.78s)]
*  who's a Marxist writing in the post-war period. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4651.419999999999s)]
*  I guess it was like the forties, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4654.259999999999s)]
*  her book came out, The Second Sex. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4655.66s)]
*  But she's just taking this totally idiotic [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4656.98s)]
*  Marxist framework and applying it to women and men. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4659.22s)]
*  What's the biggest lie? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4662.820000000001s)]
*  Because, I mean, it ignores the very obvious symbiosis. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4663.66s)]
*  It's just, it's like it's not possible [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4665.9800000000005s)]
*  for them to exist apart. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4667.5s)]
*  And it's not possible to continue the species. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4668.62s)]
*  It's like so dumb that they need each other [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4671.1s)]
*  that actually power is exerted in very subtle [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4673.9800000000005s)]
*  but powerful ways within a relationship [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4677.1s)]
*  between a man and a woman that are not at all described [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4679.740000000001s)]
*  or even acknowledged, right? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4682.34s)]
*  It's the basis of life itself. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4684.3s)]
*  Of course. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4686.46s)]
*  So it is like really, you trace back [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4687.3s)]
*  to the emergence of nihilism. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4689.62s)]
*  It really is in Marxism, it's in feminism. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4690.74s)]
*  And then they successfully cross-dress for decades [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4694.58s)]
*  and they get so good at it. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4698.0599999999995s)]
*  This is the famous long march through institutions [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4699.0199999999995s)]
*  or what they call cultural Marxism. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4701.94s)]
*  But they basically dress themselves up as, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4704.86s)]
*  I mean, basically civil rights. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4706.86s)]
*  I mean, because once you get equal rights, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4708.86s)]
*  the work is done. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4711.0199999999995s)]
*  Same thing with gays and lesbians. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4711.98s)]
*  But then the radical left activists [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4713.5s)]
*  then go and grab all those trappings. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4715.42s)]
*  We started the conversation. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4717.46s)]
*  This may seem like a digression, but it's important, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4719.34s)]
*  I think for normies and everybody to understand that. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4721.62s)]
*  I mean, it took a long time for me to get it, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4725.66s)]
*  but it was like, oh, right. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4727.66s)]
*  Like the people that call themselves environmentalists [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4728.78s)]
*  are actually just radical leftists, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4731.14s)]
*  slightly different from Marx [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4733.66s)]
*  because they're actually into Malthus, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4734.900000000001s)]
*  this totally dystopian anti-human view. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4737.58s)]
*  But the genius of the left is that they are so successful [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4740.7s)]
*  at masking their real agenda behind something else. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4745.26s)]
*  We just want equality for people of color. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4749.34s)]
*  We just wanna create equal opportunity for migrants. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4752.42s)]
*  No, their agenda is the destruction of civilization. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4754.820000000001s)]
*  I know, and you see on the environmental- [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4758.1s)]
*  And it's working in LA. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4760.22s)]
*  Well, it is working. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4761.62s)]
*  And I always thought on the environmental movement, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4763.1s)]
*  there was one called Julia Butterfly Hill. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4766.58s)]
*  I spent more than a year in a Redwood. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4768.42s)]
*  And I always thought, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4771.18s)]
*  if you were sincere about environmentalism, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4774.06s)]
*  she would be, whatever happened to her, nobody knows. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4776.06s)]
*  And that was, to your point about physicalism, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4778.900000000001s)]
*  I like Redwoods, and if there's a reason [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4782.700000000001s)]
*  to cut them down, okay, but maybe don't [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4784.54s)]
*  because they're just so beautiful. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4787.02s)]
*  That's my personal view, I always have felt that way. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4788.38s)]
*  So here was someone who was, she saved a tree, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4790.700000000001s)]
*  that's gotta be the highest level [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4793.580000000001s)]
*  of what they claim they're trying to do, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4795.54s)]
*  but they totally ignored her. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4797.620000000001s)]
*  They don't give a shit about her at all. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4798.820000000001s)]
*  She died in a tree, probably better for them. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4800.06s)]
*  What they really wanted to do was [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4802.34s)]
*  disconnect people from nature, it was the opposite. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4804.66s)]
*  So why is it that every single person I know [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4809.1s)]
*  who really spends a lot of time outdoors, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4811.66s)]
*  who's into the sporting life or whatever, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4813.22s)]
*  lives in a rural area, man, their goals are the opposite [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4816.38s)]
*  of those of the Environmental Defense Fund [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4820.58s)]
*  in the Sierra Club. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4822.5s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4823.900000000001s)]
*  Well, and also, I think the physicalist distinction [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4824.74s)]
*  works on that as well. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4827.7s)]
*  I mean, here you have, I did an interview [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4828.860000000001s)]
*  with a terrific scientist I mentioned, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4831.26s)]
*  and he's just like, when you're dealing with fires, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4833.9400000000005s)]
*  the main event is what is happening on the ground. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4837.14s)]
*  And the climate extremists are out there basically saying, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4840.34s)]
*  no, no, no, ignore this whole physical reality. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4844.74s)]
*  We just need to reorganize the entire global economy. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4847.860000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4851.14s)]
*  We can't stop these fires, let Malibu burn, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4851.9800000000005s)]
*  but give us control over the driver of the economy. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4854.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's such madness. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4858.900000000001s)]
*  And it's the opposite and they don't care. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4861.46s)]
*  I mean, what's the pollution generated by these fires? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4863.7s)]
*  Oh, it's so much. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4866.82s)]
*  I mean, I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4868.259999999999s)]
*  but it's massive. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4870.139999999999s)]
*  Now, I mean, I will say- [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4871.139999999999s)]
*  And dangerous, right? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4871.98s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, oh my gosh, the air in LA now. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4872.86s)]
*  I mean, it is, my daughter's in college there. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4875.62s)]
*  I'm worried about her. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4877.9s)]
*  I mean, it is absolutely toxic air. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4878.94s)]
*  I mean, of course it is. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4881.5s)]
*  You know, and you have a lot of electric cars [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4882.54s)]
*  and you have a lot of batteries going up. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4884.34s)]
*  We don't know what that stuff is playing out [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4887.0199999999995s)]
*  in terms of particulate matter. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4888.54s)]
*  So no, it's awful. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4890.22s)]
*  I mean, ostensibly you'll get tree growth [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4892.18s)]
*  and the carbon will be reabsorbed [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4895.66s)]
*  and those plants will be reabsorbed. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4897.54s)]
*  But yeah, no, I mean, it is- [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4898.700000000001s)]
*  I'm not talking about carbon. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4899.54s)]
*  I mean like poison in the air and water. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4900.38s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4903.02s)]
*  I mean, I think of all the houses with all the plastic [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4903.860000000001s)]
*  and electricity burning, it's terrible. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4907.06s)]
*  No, for sure. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4909.3s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's a chance to get regrounded, I think. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4910.26s)]
*  A chance to, I mean, it is also an interesting moment, right? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4914.22s)]
*  Because Hollywood, it's just producing garbage. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4917.38s)]
*  It is just, it is incredible [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4920.18s)]
*  how bad the cultural production is. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4922.14s)]
*  Just at a straight, like any of you're someone [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4923.900000000001s)]
*  that just loves pop culture, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4925.66s)]
*  like you just love Steven Spielberg. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4926.9400000000005s)]
*  We're not getting that level of quality. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4929.26s)]
*  I mean, we tried to watch something on Netflix. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4932.06s)]
*  It's just awful. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4935.02s)]
*  And it's because they're all trying to fit it in. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4936.62s)]
*  Artistry and creativity is transgressive. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4939.5s)]
*  It's supposed to be- [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4942.3s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4943.34s)]
*  It's supposed to be breaking. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4944.18s)]
*  I mean, that's actually where you want your- [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4945.02s)]
*  I want my transgression in my art, not in my civilization. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4946.14s)]
*  I want a really boring civilization [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4950.38s)]
*  and really transgressive art, but it's become the opposite. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4953.06s)]
*  The art has become boring and conformist and authoritarian [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4956.62s)]
*  and the civilization has gotten completely transgressive. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4961.820000000001s)]
*  So people are not where they need to be. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4965.22s)]
*  The laws are not being enforced. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4966.740000000001s)]
*  So I mean, part of you go, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4968.26s)]
*  God, I do hope it is a wake-up call. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4969.1s)]
*  It was five years ago this month [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4971.34s)]
*  that people started to drop dead [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4973.18s)]
*  in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4974.78s)]
*  Five years since the beginning of COVID, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4977.139999999999s)]
*  tens of millions dead, societies reordered completely, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4979.34s)]
*  economies destroyed. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4983.38s)]
*  And yet for some reason, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4984.66s)]
*  we still don't know answers to the most basic questions. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4985.9s)]
*  Where did this virus come from? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4989.139999999999s)]
*  How did it get here? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4990.58s)]
*  Why did the government tell us to do things [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4992.0199999999995s)]
*  they knew wouldn't work? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4994.0199999999995s)]
*  None of those questions have been adequately answered [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4995.38s)]
*  and one man knows those answers. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4997.62s)]
*  His name is Dr. Tony Fauci. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=4999.5s)]
*  Until now, nobody has really pressed [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5001.3s)]
*  and now a documentary filmmaker called Jennifer First [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5004.34s)]
*  is out with a new film explaining exactly what happened. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5006.9800000000005s)]
*  The film is called, Thank You Dr. Fauci. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5011.38s)]
*  Jennifer first spent years trying to get answers [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5013.7s)]
*  and in that time as he awaited Dr. Fauci's response, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5015.9400000000005s)]
*  he went through tens of thousands of pages of documents [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5018.900000000001s)]
*  and pieced together the story, which is shocking. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5022.14s)]
*  We are proud to host that documentary here on TCN [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5024.38s)]
*  from December 20th to January 19th. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5027.3s)]
*  You will see it exclusively here on TCN. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5029.62s)]
*  Again, it's called, Thank You Dr. Fauci and it's worth it. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5031.9s)]
*  So what, speaking of the laws not being enforced, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5046.0199999999995s)]
*  tell us what you know about looting. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5048.78s)]
*  Oh, I mean, that's kind of the standard. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5051.54s)]
*  That's like the norm in Los Angeles, isn't it? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5055.259999999999s)]
*  I mean. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5058.42s)]
*  Even when there's not a fire burning. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5060.379999999999s)]
*  No, of course it's terrible. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5062.78s)]
*  I mean, you don't even saw the arrest. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5063.62s)]
*  I guess they had a couple of guys, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5065.0199999999995s)]
*  they found a couple of guys looting Kamala's house [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5066.74s)]
*  and then they let them go. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5069.66s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5071.54s)]
*  They got the guy, they found the guy that set one [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5072.7s)]
*  of the fires, a homeless guy that set one of the fires [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5074.66s)]
*  and they let him go. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5076.34s)]
*  I mean, it is, it's amazing. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5077.94s)]
*  I mean, the comedians like all their best materials [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5083.58s)]
*  just in the news already. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5085.7s)]
*  How could they let your stealing from people [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5087.98s)]
*  in the middle of a profound disaster, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5091.0199999999995s)]
*  the city's burning down and you're stealing, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5093.66s)]
*  people are dying and you're stealing. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5095.339999999999s)]
*  Aren't you, you're like a true villain. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5097.379999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5099.139999999999s)]
*  And then they let them go [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5100.58s)]
*  and then that became widely publicized. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5102.259999999999s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5104.58s)]
*  This is the thing that people have to understand. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5105.78s)]
*  Criminals, they read the news. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5106.9s)]
*  Criminals are very online. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5109.58s)]
*  It's not like criminals don't know what's going on. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5111.299999999999s)]
*  And we have these amazing, there's these amazing, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5114.0199999999995s)]
*  I think it was like phone calls between people [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5116.66s)]
*  in the Oakland jails and their friends [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5118.379999999999s)]
*  and they're like basically Auntie Pam, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5119.86s)]
*  the name of the DA, they're like, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5123.259999999999s)]
*  the Auntie Pam is gonna make sure we get off. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5124.74s)]
*  They all know where the laws are not being enforced. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5127.98s)]
*  What's their job? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5131.62s)]
*  Of course, yeah, they're rational actors. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5132.46s)]
*  The irrational ones are the rest of us. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5136.0199999999995s)]
*  They're the ones trying to live there. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5137.74s)]
*  So if you're Gavin Newsom or Karen Bass, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5140.299999999999s)]
*  like you're all in on the climate change explanation, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5142.98s)]
*  right, that's all you've got at this point. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5145.82s)]
*  I mean, they did, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5147.34s)]
*  I think they are backing off a little bit from it. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5148.18s)]
*  I think that they're a little trapped, which is great, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5151.5s)]
*  which is that on the one hand, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5154.58s)]
*  they can't accept responsibility [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5158.9400000000005s)]
*  because they know that if they accept responsibility, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5160.740000000001s)]
*  then it's just, then their political futures are doomed. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5162.66s)]
*  On the other hand, by not accepting responsibility [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5167.14s)]
*  and passing the buck, that also becomes obvious to people. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5170.38s)]
*  So they should all go. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5172.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, remember like, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5174.700000000001s)]
*  New Orleans, like that mayor was out of there. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5175.94s)]
*  I mean, like- [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5178.74s)]
*  Ray Nagin, he was there for that. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5179.58s)]
*  Yeah, so that should be what happens. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5180.82s)]
*  But New Orleans has, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5183.78s)]
*  that just accelerated the decline of the city. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5185.58s)]
*  I mean, I was there for Katrina, I covered that. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5187.94s)]
*  And I thought at the time, 20 years, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5190.9s)]
*  I guess it was 20 years ago, incredibly, 2005. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5193.7s)]
*  I thought, well, it's obviously tragic, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5197.46s)]
*  but Bush is sending over a billion dollars to rebuild it. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5199.7s)]
*  I'm sure the city will be better. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5202.259999999999s)]
*  And it's been much worse ever since. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5203.339999999999s)]
*  That's depressing. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5205.900000000001s)]
*  But LA is not New Orleans. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5206.9800000000005s)]
*  That's our second biggest city. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5208.54s)]
*  It's the, in a lot of ways, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5209.66s)]
*  the greatest city we've ever built. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5210.82s)]
*  And in my opinion, and like, so what happens to it now? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5212.22s)]
*  Well, there's no vision for it at all. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5216.62s)]
*  And we don't have anybody visionary in there. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5219.02s)]
*  You know, and they did, I mean, I think we had this guy, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5221.26s)]
*  Rick Caruso, as you were mentioning, who ran for mayor. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5222.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, someone found, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5225.38s)]
*  there is a video of him calling [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5226.900000000001s)]
*  for increasing the fire department budget. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5228.3s)]
*  I mean, kind of like that. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5230.26s)]
*  What else do you need to know at this point? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5231.82s)]
*  I do think that the woke trance was broken. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5233.86s)]
*  I mean, Trump broke it. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5239.62s)]
*  You do? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5240.46s)]
*  I do, for sure. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5241.299999999999s)]
*  And look at that. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5242.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, look at the catastrophe that the news media is in [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5242.98s)]
*  and the success that people like you and I are having [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5244.58s)]
*  and Joe Rogan being the most influential. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5246.82s)]
*  He's like the new Walter Cronkite. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5249.42s)]
*  He's where, somebody was observing, [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5251.219999999999s)]
*  he's where Mark Zuckerberg goes to confess his sins. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5252.94s)]
*  So it's a different world. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5256.82s)]
*  I do have some hope for it. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5258.5s)]
*  I mean, the thing about the United States [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5259.7s)]
*  that's so different from Europe is just that literally, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5261.62s)]
*  they, I'm becoming like an old man, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5264.58s)]
*  I guess I'm talking about how great [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5266.62s)]
*  the founding fathers were, but it's like, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5267.46s)]
*  literally they created this incredible system [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5269.14s)]
*  that if you have free speech, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5272.0599999999995s)]
*  if you can protect your free speech, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5275.26s)]
*  which we've, I think succeeded in doing, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5278.14s)]
*  you bake it in, you remind people of its importance, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5280.34s)]
*  you then are, I think, gonna be able to self-correct [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5283.38s)]
*  in ways that places that allow higher levels [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5286.66s)]
*  of censorship are simply not gonna be able to do. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5289.14s)]
*  I mean, just look at this impact [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5291.700000000001s)]
*  that Elon is having right now. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5292.9400000000005s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5294.42s)]
*  I was on some social media chat group [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5295.38s)]
*  and somebody was like, how come we're all talking [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5297.34s)]
*  about the British grooming gangs? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5299.42s)]
*  It's like, cause Elon decided that that was an issue. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5301.42s)]
*  The AFD in Germany may end up, you know, be, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5305.3s)]
*  I mean, I think they're gonna come in at least second [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5308.06s)]
*  in the elections next month [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5310.26s)]
*  cause Elon has mainstreamed them. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5312.02s)]
*  Of course. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5314.3s)]
*  So that gives me a lot of hope. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5315.14s)]
*  You've got a platform now that is still just the, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5317.14s)]
*  I mean, we always knew that the media [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5320.820000000001s)]
*  had that agenda setting power, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5323.26s)]
*  but it's amazing to sort of see it so dramatically. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5326.42s)]
*  You only can really see it when it shifts [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5329.9400000000005s)]
*  from the mainstream news media. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5332.22s)]
*  We were writing last summer about how the sovereign [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5334.02s)]
*  in the United States, meaning like the true power center [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5338.22s)]
*  in the United States was the news media. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5341.02s)]
*  That is now, my view clearly shifted to acts. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5343.58s)]
*  It's just, I think you said something recently. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5347.22s)]
*  I think I saw a clip of you saying the same thing. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5348.62s)]
*  I mean, it's just clear, like that is where- [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5350.3s)]
*  It dominates everything. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5352.34s)]
*  It's just everything, you know, and like blue sky gave it, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5353.18s)]
*  they gave it a shot, but nobody can go on there. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5356.46s)]
*  It's too mad. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5358.42s)]
*  It's too insane. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5359.26s)]
*  So I think it can be very, very positive. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5360.66s)]
*  You know, I always compare acts to, you know, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5362.9s)]
*  it's like when the printing press was, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5366.14s)]
*  first shows up in the end of the 15th century [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5368.5s)]
*  for like about a hundred years, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5371.14s)]
*  the Catholic church was like, the printing press is great. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5372.78s)]
*  You know, we can print Bibles and give them out [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5375.259999999999s)]
*  to all the priests, it's very cheap. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5377.5s)]
*  The Catholic church loved the printing press. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5379.0599999999995s)]
*  And then Martin Luther got ahold of the printing press. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5381.3s)]
*  And it was just, for the next, you know, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5384.82s)]
*  five centuries, it was game over. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5387.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, the best history of the printing press, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5388.7s)]
*  she goes back, I think it's a Oxford history. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5392.3s)]
*  She goes back and just looks at its impact [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5395.0199999999995s)]
*  and she comes back and she's just like, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5396.82s)]
*  you know, a few years of study or whatever. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5398.54s)]
*  And she's like, oh, we knew it was a big deal, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5399.66s)]
*  but it was a much bigger deal than we thought. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5402.3s)]
*  It's not just the Protestant Reformation. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5404.06s)]
*  It is that it's also the scientific revolution. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5405.900000000001s)]
*  It's the industrial revolution, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5408.78s)]
*  it's nationalism and it's democracy. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5410.7s)]
*  I mean, so you get a huge, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5412.9800000000005s)]
*  ethical change with this shift of communications technologies [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5414.34s)]
*  and social media, we knew it, I mean, we, you know, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5417.62s)]
*  Martin Gury famously wrote this book, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5420.14s)]
*  Revolt of the Public, [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5421.860000000001s)]
*  about the game-changing aspects of social media, [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5423.42s)]
*  just on the Arab Spring, you know, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5425.820000000001s)]
*  which is now 14 years ago, but in some senses, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5427.66s)]
*  it really just didn't get its power until Elon came in, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5431.26s)]
*  bought it and held strong against people calling him [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5433.9800000000005s)]
*  a racist anti-Semite for two years. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5437.54s)]
*  I mean, it was just crazy. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5440.34s)]
*  It was like two years of the media just making him out [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5441.7s)]
*  to be the devil incarnate and he held strong [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5445.22s)]
*  and he ended up breaking the news media. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5448.1s)]
*  I mean, they're just not getting the traffic. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5450.7s)]
*  They're done. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5453.1s)]
*  It's over. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5453.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. It's over. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5454.860000000001s)]
*  So where does, I mean, so if I'm- [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5456.1s)]
*  And it couldn't have happened to a worse group of people. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5458.26s)]
*  I spent my whole life among them. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5461.0199999999995s)]
*  I can tell you that's absolutely true [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5462.099999999999s)]
*  and they're, you know, they're terrified. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5463.74s)]
*  I was watching John Karl on CBS who I've known, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5466.3s)]
*  someone sent me a clip this morning, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5470.58s)]
*  John Karl, I've known him for over 30 years, nice guy, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5472.3s)]
*  you know, reasonable guy. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5474.58s)]
*  And then Trump comes, the business starts to collapse [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5477.5s)]
*  and he realizes, I'm speaking for him, but he realizes, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5479.86s)]
*  oh shit, you know, I'm a middle-aged white guy, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5482.3s)]
*  I better go along and he becomes just this cheerleader [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5484.42s)]
*  for every stupid woke idea ever. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5486.9s)]
*  He feels sorry for him. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5490.22s)]
*  He's a nice guy actually and not a stupid guy. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5491.18s)]
*  Someone just sent me a clip of John Karl, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5493.62s)]
*  like basically defending Trump. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5496.06s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5497.94s)]
*  And it's just like, I'm again, I'm not attacked. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5498.78s)]
*  The wind moved. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5501.78s)]
*  The wind moved. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5502.62s)]
*  Then you realize that most people just kind of, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5504.42s)]
*  you know, they're easy to control. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5507.82s)]
*  You just tell them what the program is [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5511.46s)]
*  and they go along with it. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5513.74s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's Kent Brockman. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5514.58s)]
*  No, you're totally right. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5515.98s)]
*  I welcome our new alien overlords. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5517.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5519.26s)]
*  They're the first ones to shift. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5521.34s)]
*  No, you're right. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5523.7s)]
*  You're right. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5524.54s)]
*  Yeah, because they're covering the news. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5525.38s)]
*  Like they know, they're the first ones [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5526.78s)]
*  that know when the winds are coming. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5528.58s)]
*  The principle plays no role. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5529.7s)]
*  Most people just kind of go along with what they think [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5530.9800000000005s)]
*  the marching orders are. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5532.82s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5533.66s)]
*  It really reveals, doesn't it, the herd animals. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5534.5s)]
*  Yeah, and did I say CBS? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5537.3s)]
*  I think he's at ABC, whatever. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5538.26s)]
*  They're all the same and they're all going away. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5539.46s)]
*  But if you're true entrenched power, which does exist, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5541.58s)]
*  particularly in the intel agencies, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5544.42s)]
*  I mean, that's where it really resides, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5545.86s)]
*  as far as I can tell. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5547.46s)]
*  I don't know, it's like pretty threatening. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5550.0599999999995s)]
*  There's been a massive movement in power [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5552.34s)]
*  from the news media, which you control. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5554.98s)]
*  That's a fact, I would say. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5557.62s)]
*  In effect, control, news media is controlled [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5559.78s)]
*  by the intel agencies. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5561.46s)]
*  Fact to something you can't control. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5562.299999999999s)]
*  So that's a huge loss of power for you. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5564.42s)]
*  So like, how can you let this continue? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5565.82s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, how can they stop it though? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5567.9s)]
*  I mean, the- [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5570.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5571.58s)]
*  I'm just feeling a little paranoid right now. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5572.42s)]
*  No, no, I am too. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5573.259999999999s)]
*  This is too much freedom. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5574.099999999999s)]
*  No, I know. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5574.94s)]
*  No, I totally do too. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5575.78s)]
*  You're like, when's the penny gonna drop? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5577.86s)]
*  Yeah, kind of. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5579.7s)]
*  Well, yeah, and I also kind of go, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5581.339999999999s)]
*  are they really gonna disclose [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5582.379999999999s)]
*  all the stuff that they have? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5583.5s)]
*  I mean, we were going down, we just did a, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5584.66s)]
*  actually, I don't know if we published it yet, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5586.219999999999s)]
*  but we were just going down the list [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5587.219999999999s)]
*  of all the files that we want. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5588.259999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5589.86s)]
*  Because people were like, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5590.7s)]
*  oh, can we have the Twitter files for the government? [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5591.5199999999995s)]
*  And you're like, yes. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5592.36s)]
*  There's so much in there, right? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5595.66s)]
*  It's like Russiagate, the Russiaclusion hoax, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5596.5s)]
*  COVID origins, COVID vaccines, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5600.0199999999995s)]
*  Hunter Biden laptop. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5603.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5604.9s)]
*  I mean, I'm assuming there's just a bunch of stuff [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5605.74s)]
*  on Russia, Ukraine that's there. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5606.94s)]
*  I mean, remember, because they keep leaking, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5608.9s)]
*  they'd go, there's no bio labs in Ukraine. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5610.179999999999s)]
*  Well, there were some, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5614.94s)]
*  we were doing some help with the bio safety. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5615.78s)]
*  Well, not only are there bio labs in Ukraine, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5617.139999999999s)]
*  there are a lot of bio labs in Ukraine, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5619.099999999999s)]
*  which are working on biological weapons. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5620.34s)]
*  That's what they're not there for, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5622.34s)]
*  livestock vaccine, sorry. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5624.26s)]
*  And the thing that people don't in this country understand [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5626.26s)]
*  is that the Ukrainian military is selling [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5630.3s)]
*  about half of the arms they get from the United States [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5632.08s)]
*  into international black markets. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5634.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're winding up in some case [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5635.98s)]
*  with the drug cartels in Latin America. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5637.0s)]
*  That's a fact, okay, it's a fact. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5639.08s)]
*  And you can buy them. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5641.16s)]
*  And I spoke to someone who did buy some actually. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5642.8s)]
*  So I know this is a fact and they're bragging about it. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5644.86s)]
*  So they're selling conventional weapons, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5647.96s)]
*  including weapons systems that are very dangerous [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5649.74s)]
*  and very destabilizing that would make commercial air travel [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5651.64s)]
*  impossible, for example. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5654.12s)]
*  And so what are they doing with the pathogens [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5656.24s)]
*  in those bio labs? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5658.12s)]
*  And does the Biden administration have a manifest? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5659.04s)]
*  Do they know exactly what's in those labs? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5663.24s)]
*  And will they turn it over to the Trump administration [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5664.96s)]
*  so we can keep track of these things? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5666.86s)]
*  And the answer is no, actually. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5668.6s)]
*  The answer is no, I know this. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5670.36s)]
*  So that's like the scariest thing that's ever happened. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5671.88s)]
*  And so like, I think the Ukraine war has the potential [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5676.32s)]
*  to destabilize the world more than anything [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5682.26s)]
*  that's happened in my lifetime, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5683.8s)]
*  just because of the scale of the weapons systems [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5685.44s)]
*  and biological agents involved [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5689.48s)]
*  in the most corrupt country in the West, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5692.599999999999s)]
*  which is Ukraine, not attacking Ukraine, [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5694.759999999999s)]
*  I feel sorry for Ukraine, but what the hell? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5695.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5699.12s)]
*  And so we could use some, we could use, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5699.96s)]
*  that's why I'm saying this right now, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5701.839999999999s)]
*  because I hope this is widely disseminated, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5702.96s)]
*  because I think it's like the scariest thing [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5705.16s)]
*  I've heard in a long, long time. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5706.719999999999s)]
*  That is scary. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5708.719999999999s)]
*  But it's all flowered in secrecy, that's the point. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5709.5599999999995s)]
*  The only reason this stuff has happened, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5713.16s)]
*  like this end of the world stuff has happened [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5716.24s)]
*  is because there's no disclosure at all. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5717.38s)]
*  Everything is- [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5719.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5720.06s)]
*  Oh, it's so much pent up stuff. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5720.900000000001s)]
*  So much. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5722.26s)]
*  I mean, we're still, yeah, we have the JFK files, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5723.54s)]
*  the UFO files, UAP files, I was just to say. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5725.34s)]
*  Yeah, there's so much there. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5729.14s)]
*  So I spoke to someone about the UAP thing, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5729.9800000000005s)]
*  now we're so far afield, but do you think it's all connected? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5731.42s)]
*  No, it is all connected though. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5733.62s)]
*  It's like none of this stuff happens except in secrecy. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5734.82s)]
*  And this, I said, well, stop playing, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5737.82s)]
*  like you've been talking to these people for years now. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5740.14s)]
*  And the answer was the public is not ready [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5743.66s)]
*  for this information because it's just too much. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5746.139999999999s)]
*  And what's your view of that? [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5752.76s)]
*  And this is someone who's pushing disclosure, by the way. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5755.38s)]
*  This is not- [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5757.22s)]
*  I know. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5758.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5758.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm worried that it's bad news. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5759.72s)]
*  Well, that's the point, it's bad news. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5761.46s)]
*  I'm worried it's bad news. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5763.0199999999995s)]
*  Really bad news. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5763.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5764.68s)]
*  Do you think that's true? [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5765.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5766.34s)]
*  No, I'm not even saying it [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5767.18s)]
*  because I don't know if it's true and it is bad. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5768.5s)]
*  It's super bad. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5770.18s)]
*  I mean, it seems like the dominant two theories [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5771.02s)]
*  are now that it's non-human intelligence [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5773.900000000001s)]
*  or that we or our adversaries [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5776.580000000001s)]
*  have mastered anti-gravity technology. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5778.780000000001s)]
*  The other scenarios of some kind of new plasma [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5783.06s)]
*  or it's just kind of, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5787.22s)]
*  the phenomenon doesn't seem to be showing up in that way. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5790.860000000001s)]
*  Well, the core idea seems to be [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5793.06s)]
*  that there is non-human intelligence, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5794.46s)]
*  whether all these manifestations of it are that, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5796.52s)]
*  or whether they're government programs, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5798.5s)]
*  or Chinese or whatever. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5799.700000000001s)]
*  There's probably a pastiche of all of them. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5801.38s)]
*  But the core idea seems to be [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5802.94s)]
*  that there is non-human intelligence, which is plausible, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5805.34s)]
*  and that it's been in interaction with the US government [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5807.74s)]
*  for quite some time, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5811.3s)]
*  and that it plays a role in our- [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5812.66s)]
*  What role is it playing? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5815.26s)]
*  I mean, well, there are all these things that I, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5816.34s)]
*  I don't know if what is true or what's not true. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5818.78s)]
*  Do you think any of that is true? [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5820.78s)]
*  I know you've done work on this. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5822.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and it's hard. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5824.58s)]
*  I mean, I covered the New Jersey drone situation. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5826.98s)]
*  I went to Jersey and interviewed a bunch of people. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5832.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, for me, the weirdest moment [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5834.299999999999s)]
*  is where you have John Kirby, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5836.179999999999s)]
*  the Defense Department spokesperson at Mayorkas, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5838.58s)]
*  basically on the same day or the same 48 hours, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5840.9s)]
*  just when they were asked about it, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5843.5s)]
*  they just came out affirmatively and they were like, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5845.0199999999995s)]
*  well, we're definitely not getting any drones [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5846.82s)]
*  over the military bases or other sensitive sites. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5849.099999999999s)]
*  And you're like, I was like, why would you lie about that? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5851.62s)]
*  I couldn't because of course, all else being equal, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5854.9400000000005s)]
*  I think that people don't wanna lie, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5858.18s)]
*  politicians don't wanna lie [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5860.14s)]
*  because it just creates more work or hassle for them. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5861.18s)]
*  It complicates your life, yeah. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5863.06s)]
*  It complicates your life. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5863.900000000001s)]
*  It honestly is the best policy. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5864.740000000001s)]
*  So why would they lie about that? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5866.42s)]
*  Especially because the Wall Street Journal had like, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5868.02s)]
*  they did this huge piece about all of the drone, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5870.38s)]
*  so-called, by the way, unidentified anomalous drone flyovers [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5873.42s)]
*  over the military bases and sensitive sites, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5878.54s)]
*  which includes nuclear plants. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5880.42s)]
*  Part of my interest in this was always, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5882.34s)]
*  I was trying to save Diablo Canyon in California, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5884.7s)]
*  they kept getting drone flyovers. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5886.7s)]
*  Also Palo Verde, which is our biggest nuclear plant, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5888.38s)]
*  three beautiful reactors there in Arizona, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5891.46s)]
*  like a lot of drone flyovers. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5893.82s)]
*  I'm also from Northeast Colorado, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5896.66s)]
*  which is where the ICBMs are. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5898.0599999999995s)]
*  They had this exact same drone situation, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5900.38s)]
*  I believe it was December, I wanna say December 2019, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5904.74s)]
*  and they had this whole interagency task force [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5908.54s)]
*  and they were like, oh, we're gonna put a plane up, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5910.66s)]
*  and they kinda put a plane up, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5912.5s)]
*  and you're watching them, you're like, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5913.34s)]
*  well, why are they not scrambling jets? [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5915.099999999999s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5917.42s)]
*  This is really bizarre. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5919.22s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5920.42s)]
*  I can't figure it out because I think the other issue [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5921.94s)]
*  is that they may not know. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5924.62s)]
*  Okay, well, so to finish that story, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5926.46s)]
*  so then drone migras do that, I go out and I'm just like, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5928.22s)]
*  that's the weirdest lie because it's been heavily reported. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5932.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, the drones over sensitive military bases [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5936.42s)]
*  is really well reported, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5939.86s)]
*  and some of the best reporting was by a publication [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5940.86s)]
*  called The War Zone, which I highly recommend, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5944.34s)]
*  very good serious investigative reporting. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5947.42s)]
*  They don't believe it's aliens at all. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5949.22s)]
*  They're just openly anti-alien. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5951.099999999999s)]
*  They're like, this is, and I think it's, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5953.26s)]
*  well, anyway, for whatever reason, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5955.86s)]
*  they're just like, this is Chinese or Russian or whatever, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5957.9s)]
*  they're not taking it seriously, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5960.179999999999s)]
*  but they do some of the best reporting [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5961.179999999999s)]
*  because they can't figure out why the military's [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5962.82s)]
*  being so weird about it. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5964.46s)]
*  So then Trump comes out and he goes, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5966.62s)]
*  they know what it is, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5970.38s)]
*  I don't know why they're not telling anybody. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5971.22s)]
*  And I'm gonna tell everybody on the 20th. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5973.9s)]
*  I mean, first of all, I'm really happy [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5976.94s)]
*  that they're gonna disclose, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5979.26s)]
*  and I wanna raise expectations [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5980.78s)]
*  about what the Trump administration is gonna do. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5982.7s)]
*  We want the data, and I mean, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5984.22s)]
*  someone was criticizing me because they were like, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5986.46s)]
*  oh, because I came out, I said, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5987.94s)]
*  oh, I'm confident the Trump administration [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5989.0199999999995s)]
*  is gonna share the data, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5990.3s)]
*  and they're like, that just shows that Schellenberger is, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5991.14s)]
*  it's like pro-Trump and whatever, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5993.9s)]
*  and I was like, no, I'm just like pro-disclosure. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5995.18s)]
*  I want the expectations to be high [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5996.74s)]
*  because they should be high. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5998.46s)]
*  There is so much information they're not releasing. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=5999.62s)]
*  So they were over Bedminster, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6002.22s)]
*  and he's talked about it twice now, by the way. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6003.9800000000005s)]
*  So look- [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6007.06s)]
*  At least he's distressed about it, obviously. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6007.9s)]
*  He's worried about it. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6009.1s)]
*  So we're either headed for a pretty epic moment [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6010.02s)]
*  of disclosure. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6013.1s)]
*  There's another part of me that worries. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6013.94s)]
*  So, okay, so it seems like, [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6016.06s)]
*  yeah, they could do disclosure [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6018.62s)]
*  and we could find out what it is. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6019.74s)]
*  Is it, there's gonna be aliens. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6021.54s)]
*  If it's aliens, that's just a whole can of worms, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6023.38s)]
*  and then you have to be like, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6025.9800000000005s)]
*  is there, like, do we talk to them? [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6026.82s)]
*  And if so, who's doing that? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6029.5s)]
*  Do you think we have? [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6032.259999999999s)]
*  I genuinely don't know. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6033.62s)]
*  I genuinely don't know. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6035.5s)]
*  I mean, there's this guy named, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6036.94s)]
*  I can't remember his first name, Stringfield. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6040.54s)]
*  He wrote this incredible thick book of UAP crashes, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6042.74s)]
*  crash retrievals, and he started doing it, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6049.219999999999s)]
*  I wanna say 50s or 60s, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6051.34s)]
*  and I think he went for like multiple decades, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6054.34s)]
*  and you just sit down with that book, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6056.06s)]
*  and it is like, it's impressive. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6057.38s)]
*  I mean, if it's a hoax, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6060.700000000001s)]
*  it's just one of the greatest hoaxes of all times. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6062.580000000001s)]
*  You know, like other hoaxes, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6065.620000000001s)]
*  like the protocols of the elders of Zion or whatever, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6068.54s)]
*  they're really bad. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6070.700000000001s)]
*  Like they're really, you're just like, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6072.14s)]
*  this is like the dumbest hoax ever. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6073.56s)]
*  Like most hoaxes are not that sophisticated [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6076.1s)]
*  with all these details, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6078.9400000000005s)]
*  and those people were interviewed. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6079.860000000001s)]
*  Of course, Roswell is the big case, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6080.700000000001s)]
*  but it's only apparently one of them. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6082.360000000001s)]
*  There's others. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6083.580000000001s)]
*  So there is this incredible gray literature, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6084.98s)]
*  never published by any academic press, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6089.179999999999s)]
*  by any really, a little bit of commercial nonfiction. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6090.9s)]
*  Obviously you have David Grush and Lou Elizondo. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6095.599999999999s)]
*  I testified in front of Congress on this in, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6097.419999999999s)]
*  guess I was in December or November, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6100.339999999999s)]
*  and two people, the two guys from the military, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6102.54s)]
*  when we were asked, what are they, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6105.98s)]
*  two guys said non-human intelligence, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6107.66s)]
*  and then me and the NASA guy said, we don't know, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6110.2s)]
*  because I just don't. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6113.459999999999s)]
*  What do you think the Jones over in New Jersey were? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6115.3s)]
*  I mean, look, here, let me tell, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6119.26s)]
*  let's just look at the possibility that they're human. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6121.14s)]
*  They didn't get a single one of them. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6127.1s)]
*  They didn't down a single one of them, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6128.74s)]
*  not a single one of them crashed. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6130.26s)]
*  And there was a lot of them. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6131.78s)]
*  And there was a lot of, look, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6133.46s)]
*  there's a lot of mistaken sightings. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6134.58s)]
*  It is easy to mistake things, it's totally natural. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6137.7s)]
*  But there was also, I mean, I interviewed mayors [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6140.5s)]
*  where like one of them was like, [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6145.02s)]
*  I had an SUV sized drone flying over my house. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6147.06s)]
*  Another one said he was going to a Fox News interview [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6149.46s)]
*  in New York, the car came for me, walks out his door, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6151.58s)]
*  and there's one hovering right over him. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6153.740000000001s)]
*  And he felt like it was watching him, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6155.18s)]
*  like it was there monitoring him. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6158.3s)]
*  I mean, that's weird stuff. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6159.58s)]
*  So we can't get a single drone down. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6162.12s)]
*  They're over military bases. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6164.14s)]
*  They can't seem to get any of them. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6165.34s)]
*  Do I think the Chinese could be behind, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6169.9800000000005s)]
*  or the Chinese, I mean, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6172.02s)]
*  when the Chinese decide to like encroach in you [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6174.860000000001s)]
*  in like in the South China Sea, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6177.580000000001s)]
*  when they decide, you know how they'll like warn [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6179.22s)]
*  the United States occasionally, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6181.46s)]
*  they'll be like, you're flying over our airspace. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6182.3s)]
*  It's all super calculated and like, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6183.92s)]
*  it's like a performance. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6189.26s)]
*  The Chinese are like, we're messing with you, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6190.42s)]
*  like you all kind of know. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6192.9800000000005s)]
*  And they're doing it in ways where they don't want it [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6194.0s)]
*  to escalate, but they want to get a little bit more [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6195.700000000001s)]
*  of that space. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6197.26s)]
*  It's all super calculated. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6198.1s)]
*  Now there was the balloon, you know, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6199.72s)]
*  are there Chinese balloons? [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6202.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6203.16s)]
*  But I mean, to be buzzing air, our military bases, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6204.16s)]
*  it's just so aggressive. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6208.08s)]
*  Now, when I've said that before, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6209.76s)]
*  I've had other people point out, they go, well, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6211.320000000001s)]
*  they're aggressive with the cyber attacks. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6212.4400000000005s)]
*  I guess that's true. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6215.66s)]
*  As a physicalist, I guess I kind of go flying your drones [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6217.2s)]
*  over US military bases and nuclear plants, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6221.3s)]
*  that is just a level of aggression [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6223.46s)]
*  that just doesn't seem characteristic of the Chinese. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6225.04s)]
*  Unless you were, well, of course I agree with you, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6226.64s)]
*  an intel person told me that this person believed [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6229.24s)]
*  that they were in fact Chinese [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6235.599999999999s)]
*  and that a Chinese satellite went down, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6237.32s)]
*  was visible to the naked eye. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6240.72s)]
*  There were some new stories about it. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6241.88s)]
*  It evaporated, it burned up, and that this person told me [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6244.48s)]
*  that was taken down by the US government, [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6248.72s)]
*  that was a command and control satellite for these drones. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6250.04s)]
*  Oh wow, okay. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6252.639999999999s)]
*  And the belief was the Chinese government [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6253.48s)]
*  was sending the following message, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6255.84s)]
*  that we're moving on Taiwan and maybe other things. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6257.16s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6259.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6260.76s)]
*  So, I have no idea if that's true or not, zero. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6261.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6266.16s)]
*  That just doesn't, I just gotta say, it's just so aggressive. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6268.28s)]
*  And also, but the other thing is that like- [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6272.92s)]
*  Seems reckless, actually. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6275.16s)]
*  Seems really reckless. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6276.44s)]
*  And the Chinese have not been seeking confrontations [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6277.92s)]
*  like that for the most part. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6281.64s)]
*  Now, Jesse Michaels, who is doing some of the best reporting [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6283.5599999999995s)]
*  on this issue of UAPs, he's doing YouTube videos. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6286.24s)]
*  He just did a documentary that was incredible. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6289.88s)]
*  I think it's like a couple of hours, highly recommended, [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6292.04s)]
*  that goes through the very long history [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6295.32s)]
*  of unidentified anomalous phenomena [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6297.5199999999995s)]
*  over US military bases, including all these cases of, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6299.92s)]
*  several cases of them shutting down a missile system. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6305.28s)]
*  Like a 65 year long history. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6309.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6311.599999999999s)]
*  And there was this famous press conference [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6312.44s)]
*  with like missileers and others from military bases [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6315.4s)]
*  in Washington, DC, I wanna say in the 90s, maybe, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6318.12s)]
*  maybe 80s. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6322.4s)]
*  So, like that predates any of the Chinese stuff by far. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6324.24s)]
*  It predates all the drones. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6329.24s)]
*  So that was going on for a really long time. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6330.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, if you just kind of, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6333.24s)]
*  if you step back and you look at it, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6334.5599999999995s)]
*  it looks like a very, like, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6336.36s)]
*  what is it communicating on a very basic level? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6338.2s)]
*  It's definitely communicating dominance. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6340.16s)]
*  You know, it's, you can read in a lot of different ways. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6343.040000000001s)]
*  And that's similar to what the Navy pilot said [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6345.4800000000005s)]
*  around the Tic Tac interactions off both coasts, [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6348.160000000001s)]
*  is that these were phenomena or objects, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6352.92s)]
*  whatever you're gonna call them, or craft, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6357.92s)]
*  that were just demonstrating dominance over our craft. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6359.92s)]
*  They were able to do things that our craft weren't doing. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6362.72s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6365.280000000001s)]
*  And that was, from their perspective, [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6367.52s)]
*  the point of the behavior was to say, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6369.240000000001s)]
*  we can do things that you can't. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6371.76s)]
*  Yeah, and so then the question would be, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6373.2s)]
*  so if it is an NHI, then the question is, [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6376.4400000000005s)]
*  are they communicating something? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6378.56s)]
*  And if they are communicating something, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6380.8s)]
*  why would they only be doing it in that way? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6382.04s)]
*  Like, you would, like, if you're trying to demonstrate [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6384.84s)]
*  your strength and adversary or something, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6388.72s)]
*  you're trying to send some message, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6390.16s)]
*  why would you just do that? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6391.84s)]
*  Because there's nothing that we can do [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6393.04s)]
*  with that information. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6394.280000000001s)]
*  So then you have to wonder, okay, if it is NHI [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6395.76s)]
*  and it's behaving in that way. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6399.16s)]
*  Non-human intelligence. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6400.0s)]
*  Non-human intelligence, then, is there some, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6400.88s)]
*  is there actually some other communication going on [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6404.4800000000005s)]
*  that we don't know about? [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6407.16s)]
*  And of course, there's just a long history [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6408.32s)]
*  and there's all these crazy stories of presidents. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6410.88s)]
*  I mean, going back to Eisenhower. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6414.4400000000005s)]
*  So just to bottom line your view after reporting [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6416.68s)]
*  on the lights over New Jersey, in Pennsylvania, New York, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6421.16s)]
*  mid-Atlantic drone hysteria, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6425.08s)]
*  do you think they were human-made drones? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6429.68s)]
*  I genuinely don't know. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6432.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, I will be, I'll be, I might be more shocked [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6434.08s)]
*  if they were human-made because of their behaviors [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6436.72s)]
*  and they never were able to get one. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6439.0s)]
*  I did have somebody tell me recently that they had heard, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6440.64s)]
*  I mean, again, it's always second-hand, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6443.56s)]
*  it's so untrustworthy, but somebody told me [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6445.160000000001s)]
*  that the military got one of the orbs, the famous orbs, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6446.92s)]
*  and opened it up and it was Chinese. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6451.56s)]
*  I mean, if that's the case, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6454.04s)]
*  then somebody has mastered anti-gravity [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6456.52s)]
*  and that's almost harder for me to believe [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6459.0s)]
*  than that it's NHI because I mean, it's just, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6461.36s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6465.6s)]
*  I mean, look, we have a, I mean, here's the, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6466.44s)]
*  I literally go back and forth, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6467.72s)]
*  you can see me doing it in the same conversation, [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6469.16s)]
*  but we have these huge black budgets in the military. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6470.72s)]
*  I mean, just gigantic and they've been there for decades. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6473.48s)]
*  So is it possible to cover up something like that? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6476.64s)]
*  I think it might be. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6479.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm much more after having covered [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6480.72s)]
*  the Hunter Biden laptop and I mean, Russia gate too, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6482.56s)]
*  but really the Hunter Biden laptop, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6486.28s)]
*  I was just impressed by how many people were involved [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6487.84s)]
*  in the conspiracy to cover it up. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6490.6s)]
*  I mean, you had the FBI getting it, covering it up, [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6492.64s)]
*  basically working with Aspen Institute [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6496.12s)]
*  to run a disinformation campaign. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6499.96s)]
*  By the way, this is Vivian Schiller and Garrett Graff [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6502.6s)]
*  run the disinformation campaign aimed at persuading [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6508.28s)]
*  journalists in advance of the release [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6511.28s)]
*  of the Hunter Biden laptop [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6513.12s)]
*  that it was a Russian information operation. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6515.12s)]
*  Garrett Graff is the guy that goes [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6519.5599999999995s)]
*  and does the big UFO book. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6522.24s)]
*  So these things all, I mean, this was very weird. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6525.24s)]
*  So he comes out with a big book on UFOs. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6527.599999999999s)]
*  I think it was last year, it was called UFO, Garrett Graff. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6529.48s)]
*  This is somebody that is famously close [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6532.5599999999995s)]
*  with the intelligence community. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6534.84s)]
*  His other books were on Watergate and on 9-11. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6536.28s)]
*  The book, both of which were totally legitimate. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6540.2s)]
*  No, for sure. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6542.48s)]
*  The official story is everything we need to know. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6543.719999999999s)]
*  So you sort of go. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6546.44s)]
*  And what was his conclusion on UFOs? [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6548.32s)]
*  Well, it was very, it's the narrative is [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6549.719999999999s)]
*  that they don't know what they are. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6553.44s)]
*  So he doesn't fully, he's not like a debunker, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6555.08s)]
*  like these guys who are like, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6557.719999999999s)]
*  oh, we can explain everything. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6558.719999999999s)]
*  So he's much more sophisticated than that. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6560.32s)]
*  But it's basically a debunking. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6563.0s)]
*  It's basically that it's just all the typical explanations [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6564.48s)]
*  and then maybe some US military programs. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6569.679999999999s)]
*  But he also just says that he just argues [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6572.679999999999s)]
*  that the US military doesn't know what it is. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6574.599999999999s)]
*  I don't believe Garrett Graff. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6577.719999999999s)]
*  And the reason I don't believe Garrett Graff [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6580.32s)]
*  is because I saw him participate [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6582.4s)]
*  in a disinformation campaign on Hunter buying a laptop. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6584.24s)]
*  And I know for a fact that there's something else going on [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6586.839999999999s)]
*  at that Aspen Institute program. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6590.16s)]
*  And Aspen Institute, of course, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6591.879999999999s)]
*  is a massive US government funded NGO [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6592.719999999999s)]
*  that cosplayed the US military. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6595.5599999999995s)]
*  That cosplays as a kind of, you know, bourgeois gab fest. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6598.6s)]
*  So there, I mean, so I'm like, that was for me, [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6603.6s)]
*  that was all came out on the Twitter files. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6606.68s)]
*  I discovered that in the Twitter files. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6608.04s)]
*  And for me, it was like pulling back the curtain [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6609.76s)]
*  and you actually have, as a journalist, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6611.92s)]
*  like you, we have the emails, you know, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6614.0s)]
*  like you have the documents, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6616.08s)]
*  you have the tabletop exercise [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6617.28s)]
*  where they're brainwashing journalists [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6619.360000000001s)]
*  into believing a lie about the Hunter buying a laptop. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6620.76s)]
*  That was so sophisticated of that [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6624.84s)]
*  because they basically go and brainwash journalists [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6628.04s)]
*  before the story comes out [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6630.28s)]
*  because they know they're listening to Giuliani, [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6631.68s)]
*  you know, their FBI tap on Giuliani. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6633.76s)]
*  They're listening to Giuliani. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6635.2s)]
*  They know they gotta go brainwash the journalists. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6636.56s)]
*  They go get all the journalists from all the major outlets [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6639.400000000001s)]
*  plus the social media platforms in these seminars [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6641.72s)]
*  where they program them. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6644.72s)]
*  I mean, that was like, for me, it was like, wow, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6647.76s)]
*  there's like a secret government. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6649.28s)]
*  Like it was like, there's like a whole, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6650.6s)]
*  there's like a whole, it's a very, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6652.92s)]
*  and it was very, just sophisticated. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6654.88s)]
*  I don't know how else to describe it. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6656.04s)]
*  Like it was very, everything seemed very careful. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6656.92s)]
*  Also with all the censorship stuff, [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6659.4s)]
*  you see these limited hangouts, right? [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6660.719999999999s)]
*  Where limited hangouts are kind of like [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6663.2s)]
*  the public relations of a covert operation, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6665.5199999999995s)]
*  of like a covert propaganda operation [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6669.759999999999s)]
*  where like after they get caught, they can be like, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6671.92s)]
*  oh no, we were totally honest about what we were doing. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6673.5599999999995s)]
*  We were talking about it, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6675.4s)]
*  but they do these weird limited hangouts. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6676.24s)]
*  You'll see these people that clearly look like [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6678.719999999999s)]
*  either directly intelligence community [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6680.759999999999s)]
*  or their intermediaries having these conversations [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6682.8s)]
*  they put on YouTube and like, they're like, [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6685.6s)]
*  but it's like, you know, a couple hundred views, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6687.28s)]
*  like they're not promoting them in any way. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6691.08s)]
*  And so you just kind of go, wow, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6693.88s)]
*  there's like a whole creepy like world of disinformation. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6695.12s)]
*  And what you realize is that the covert operations [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6698.360000000001s)]
*  are really not covert. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6700.6s)]
*  Like all the information's out there actually, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6701.4800000000005s)]
*  but it's just discredited or unnoticed [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6705.4800000000005s)]
*  or no one collates it. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6708.16s)]
*  Have you noticed that? [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6709.8s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6711.08s)]
*  And you only can understand it [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6712.44s)]
*  when you see the whole big picture [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6715.5599999999995s)]
*  because there's no smoking guns ever. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6717.28s)]
*  So there's never something you can, [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6719.24s)]
*  I mean, a hunter buying a laptop got us about as close [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6720.24s)]
*  as a smoking gun as you can get. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6722.76s)]
*  And it helped because it was, [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6724.72s)]
*  what helped to expose it was that it was partisan. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6726.68s)]
*  And so it was a particular partisan weaponization. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6729.8s)]
*  My concern with the UAPs, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6732.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's now, I guess the strength and a weakness [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6734.84s)]
*  is that it's become bipartisan in terms of the desire. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6737.4s)]
*  I mean, it was really, I mean, Tucker, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6740.68s)]
*  the weirdest experience I've had, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6742.12s)]
*  I've testified now like 12 times or 13 times [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6743.64s)]
*  in front of Congress in the last few years, [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6746.0s)]
*  the weirdest experience I've had was on UAPs, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6747.84s)]
*  seeing the Democrats and Republicans basically being aligned [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6751.04s)]
*  in wanting to get to the bottom of the UAP thing. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6754.52s)]
*  I mean, it's beautiful. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6756.6s)]
*  Like I've never seen it. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6757.4400000000005s)]
*  I was like, I've never heard of bipartisanship. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6758.280000000001s)]
*  Never thought I would see it in the wild. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6760.68s)]
*  So that is exciting. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6764.64s)]
*  On the other hand, I suspect that there is also [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6765.84s)]
*  some bipartisan group that's trying [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6768.320000000001s)]
*  to prevent that information from being out for some reason. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6769.68s)]
*  So, I mean, look, I mean, it is, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6772.6s)]
*  I mean, what is gonna happen? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6775.96s)]
*  I mean, part of me is, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6777.200000000001s)]
*  maybe it's my defensive pessimism on it [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6779.4800000000005s)]
*  because like everybody else, I want the information. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6781.4800000000005s)]
*  Part of me is like, there's just no way [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6784.360000000001s)]
*  they're gonna let that information out. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6785.52s)]
*  It's just something is too, [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6787.12s)]
*  there's something about the UAP thing, like the JFK thing, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6788.92s)]
*  where there's some secret there that they are really, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6792.68s)]
*  there is some group of people [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6796.04s)]
*  that really don't want us to know. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6797.2s)]
*  So, you know. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6799.8s)]
*  Well, that's a fact. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6800.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6802.12s)]
*  I bumped up against that personally several times [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6802.96s)]
*  on both of those issues, which appear to be related. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6805.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6808.4s)]
*  But I don't know the answer. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6809.72s)]
*  It's almost like seeing something in photographic negative. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6811.92s)]
*  All I know for a fact confirmed [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6814.76s)]
*  is that they are willing to go to extreme lengths [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6817.4s)]
*  to keep it secret. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6820.599999999999s)]
*  And so that's just to tell that it's, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6822.16s)]
*  there's something profound there. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6823.639999999999s)]
*  It's not just a bureaucracy covering its own ass. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6824.88s)]
*  I mean, how about the clip where Pompeo is being interviewed [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6827.84s)]
*  about the JFK files, and then he like literally [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6830.44s)]
*  mid-sense goes, but I mean, I've also seen the UFO files. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6833.4s)]
*  And it was like, well, why did you just switch [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6836.64s)]
*  from like, what made you think of the UFO files [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6839.28s)]
*  on the JFK files? [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6842.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6846.0s)]
*  I mean, so anyway, is there a secret, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6846.92s)]
*  have we developed anti-gravity? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6850.4s)]
*  Have we developed, I mean, we know that in the 50s, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6852.4s)]
*  there were like, there was a, there's a whole book on it. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6855.5199999999995s)]
*  It's very fascinating, but there was like, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6858.12s)]
*  there was an anti-gravity program in the US military [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6859.5599999999995s)]
*  with our defense contractors. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6862.08s)]
*  It made the cover of one of the aerospace magazines. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6863.839999999999s)]
*  It was like, there's like a cover of it. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6867.12s)]
*  And then it just disappeared. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6868.759999999999s)]
*  And so you can kind of go, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6870.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, the official experts go, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6872.679999999999s)]
*  yeah, we tried that and it didn't work. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6873.839999999999s)]
*  It's like, well, how would, that's never stopped you before. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6875.28s)]
*  Like it not working, like that's like, you know, [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6880.24s)]
*  like you would keep working on it [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6884.56s)]
*  if you can do anti-gravity. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6885.92s)]
*  So the other possibility is that it just went dark [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6886.88s)]
*  and they just, they kept doing it. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6888.68s)]
*  Well, I wonder though about the, like the possibility [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6890.64s)]
*  that there is a, or has been technology transfer [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6893.4800000000005s)]
*  from some other realm to this realm. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6897.16s)]
*  Cause there are, you know, just in the study of history, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6901.76s)]
*  there are, it's like, there's really no understanding [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6903.68s)]
*  at a bunch of different points of in human societal evolution. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6906.88s)]
*  Like, where did that technology come from? [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6910.16s)]
*  And you see that on a bunch of different technologies. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6912.48s)]
*  So, but nuclear, anti-gravity, that kind of stuff, [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6916.36s)]
*  like, are you open to the possibility that, [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6919.599999999999s)]
*  that there's been like a transfer of that technology [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6923.959999999999s)]
*  from some other realm? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6926.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, that is definitely, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6927.719999999999s)]
*  that is what a lot of people talk about. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6929.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6931.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, the problem with this issue is just, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6932.759999999999s)]
*  it's very frustrating because it's just all secondhand. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6934.799999999999s)]
*  Of course it is. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6937.759999999999s)]
*  And so like the 100-byton laptop is not secondhand. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6938.599999999999s)]
*  Like it's firsthand and I have the documents. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6941.76s)]
*  Now there are a bunch of really fascinating, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6944.96s)]
*  you know, alleged US secret, US government documents [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6949.6s)]
*  on UFOs, on alleged alien spacecraft crashes. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6952.360000000001s)]
*  They're called the, you know, majestic documents [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6958.56s)]
*  or the MJ-12 documents. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6961.16s)]
*  And so the story is that, you know, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6962.92s)]
*  that one or two of these craft crashed in 1947 [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6966.08s)]
*  near Roswell, New Mexico. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6970.12s)]
*  And that sort of begins in, you know, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6972.2s)]
*  and there's a whole cast of characters that allegedly, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6974.24s)]
*  you know, including Oppenheimer were involved [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6976.48s)]
*  in that program, you know, the- [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6979.5599999999995s)]
*  Why would Oppenheimer be involved? [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6982.36s)]
*  Well, why, I mean, because he was the man, you know, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6983.84s)]
*  like he was like, he was our greatest scientist, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6986.28s)]
*  obviously the father of the atomic bomb. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6988.96s)]
*  And, and, you know, Roswell is where the, [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6991.5599999999995s)]
*  where we launched the flights to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6994.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's very symbolic in that sense. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=6998.8s)]
*  Maybe more than symbolic. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7001.12s)]
*  Yeah, maybe more than symbolic. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7002.52s)]
*  I mean, they keep flying over nuclear, like, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7003.92s)]
*  as my wife says, she's like, [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7005.6s)]
*  they're aliens really, they don't like the nuclear, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7006.52s)]
*  you know, cause I love nuclear. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7009.04s)]
*  So, and I'm kind of like, I'm like, well, yeah, I mean, like, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7010.16s)]
*  and also the most ridiculous thing is when people are like, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7013.52s)]
*  oh, yeah, they want us to give, give up our, you know, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7016.2s)]
*  the people that believe in them, they go, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7018.64s)]
*  the aliens are here and they want us to give up [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7019.76s)]
*  our nuclear weapons. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7021.56s)]
*  It was like, doesn't sound like a good idea to me. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7022.400000000001s)]
*  The foreign space invaders would like you to give up [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7025.88s)]
*  your most powerful weapons. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7027.76s)]
*  But those documents, I spent a bunch of time on them [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7029.72s)]
*  and I couldn't figure out how to report anything on it [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7031.96s)]
*  because of course, of course, FBI was like, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7033.88s)]
*  these are all debunked, they're all frauds. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7036.04s)]
*  But there are, first of all, there's a lot more of them. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7038.320000000001s)]
*  You go to majesticdocuments.com and you can look at them. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7040.280000000001s)]
*  They're amazing. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7043.0s)]
*  I mean, if they are, and I've also had, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7043.96s)]
*  the other, and they're by the way, in those, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7046.92s)]
*  in the Gert Graf book, they're in that book. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7049.0s)]
*  There's another debunking book called, by Mark Pilkington, [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7050.56s)]
*  I'm blanking on the name right now, [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7055.88s)]
*  but they all, all the people that are the debunkers [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7058.72s)]
*  deal with these documents. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7060.320000000001s)]
*  And their story is not that they were all hoaxes. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7061.84s)]
*  Their story is that they were what's called [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7065.360000000001s)]
*  counterintelligence passage material, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7067.2s)]
*  documents that were created by the US government, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7070.240000000001s)]
*  but leaked to people to ostensibly be able to smoke out [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7072.64s)]
*  double agents or people like you would see them, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7076.4400000000005s)]
*  I guess you would trace these documents. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7078.92s)]
*  Like putting dye in the water to find the leak. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7080.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7082.8s)]
*  So, I mean, but the thing is, I mean, it is like, [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7083.88s)]
*  one of them is a handbook of crash retrieval, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7087.72s)]
*  like for like to, like that the soldiers [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7091.5199999999995s)]
*  would ostensibly read to retrieve these crash. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7093.92s)]
*  I mean, it's, if they're hoaxes, they're incredible. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7095.88s)]
*  I mean, like they have like the people, [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7100.599999999999s)]
*  like they have, I forgot what it's called, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7103.16s)]
*  but like basically like a manifest [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7104.24s)]
*  where they show who's checked it out and read it. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7105.76s)]
*  And they have all these different names [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7107.84s)]
*  and they've checked those names. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7108.72s)]
*  And those were like real people at those air bases [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7109.76s)]
*  that had these documents. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7111.679999999999s)]
*  So, and then, you know, there was one document [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7114.28s)]
*  in particular where it was a memo from JFK [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7117.72s)]
*  to the CIA director Dulles, where he says, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7120.28s)]
*  I wanna see you on this particular day. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7122.599999999999s)]
*  It was like July 62 or 63, I can't remember which. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7124.12s)]
*  And that again, it was like, well, that's a forgery. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7128.0s)]
*  It's part of the MJ-12 documents or whatever, it's not real. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7129.5599999999995s)]
*  But then they released the JFK files. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7132.16s)]
*  And then sure enough, we see the Dulles calendar [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7133.8s)]
*  and he had met with JFK twice that day. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7135.5199999999995s)]
*  And nobody had known that they had had those meetings [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7137.32s)]
*  until we had that JFK mem, [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7139.72s)]
*  until we had the confirmation of the memo. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7142.96s)]
*  So that would suggest that at least [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7144.8s)]
*  either that document is real, the JFK memo to Dulles, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7147.56s)]
*  or whoever forged it knew that he had met [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7152.08s)]
*  with Dulles that day and nobody else had known that. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7155.64s)]
*  So, you know, you'd be sort of like, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7158.64s)]
*  I guess you could still put it in, [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7160.64s)]
*  this is why, this is the problem with this issue [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7162.4800000000005s)]
*  is you can still, there's still plausible deniability [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7164.0s)]
*  for a lot, for all of these things. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7167.68s)]
*  You know, you can make up a reason [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7169.52s)]
*  for why these documents are all [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7170.8s)]
*  counterintelligence passage material. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7172.96s)]
*  I don't know, that's why I just have to kind of go, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7177.64s)]
*  I don't know, I mean, I talk to a lot of people and yeah, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7179.360000000001s)]
*  it's just a lot of secondhand information [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7184.12s)]
*  and the documents are secondhand. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7185.88s)]
*  So you kind of go, there's like my world [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7186.96s)]
*  of like the Hunter Biden laptop, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7189.12s)]
*  which still a bunch of my progressive and Democrat [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7190.52s)]
*  friends and family don't believe, you know, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7192.64s)]
*  they still think the Russians were somehow involved. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7194.4800000000005s)]
*  But like, I actually have the documents [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7198.28s)]
*  and we can prove what happened there. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7199.76s)]
*  On the UAP stuff, it's just still just surrounded in- [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7201.4800000000005s)]
*  But the incoming president has said, he just said, [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7205.64s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you what those drones were about. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7208.2s)]
*  He was very relaxed about it too. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7212.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, I was struck that when he, [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7214.360000000001s)]
*  she said it twice, he said it again recently, [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7215.96s)]
*  like last week, right? [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7217.6s)]
*  And, but then he said it in December, [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7218.68s)]
*  he goes, I don't know why they're Biden, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7220.64s)]
*  like, I don't know why they're not telling people [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7222.16s)]
*  what they are, they know what they are. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7223.52s)]
*  And I was like, I mean, it was a really, [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7225.24s)]
*  he made it sound like it's no big deal, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7228.96s)]
*  like we should just tell people what it is. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7230.28s)]
*  But if Trump knew what it is, and if it's NHI [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7232.04s)]
*  and Trump knows that, he seemed very relaxed about that. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7234.92s)]
*  Because of course, the, I mean, the main, [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7238.32s)]
*  the dominant, the conventional wisdom among people [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7242.16s)]
*  that follow this who think it's NHI is that it's bad news. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7244.08s)]
*  But it's not a great story, that if it were good news [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7250.92s)]
*  and that they were just friendly space brothers, [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7254.8s)]
*  offering us advanced tech, then, and they'd be like, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7257.04s)]
*  and there's no strings attached or whatever, [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7260.72s)]
*  that would be a much easier story to sell. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7262.72s)]
*  But if there's some bad news in that story, [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7265.0s)]
*  then that might explain why they're so secretive. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7267.16s)]
*  Well, clearly there's some bad news. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7268.84s)]
*  My theory is that the reason that permanent Washington [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7269.96s)]
*  or deep state or whatever, people who administer the system [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7273.84s)]
*  hate Trump is not because of any of his policies, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7276.88s)]
*  which they're probably agnostic on, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7279.84s)]
*  but because they fear that he will disclose information. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7281.24s)]
*  I think it's everything's about disclosure. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7286.28s)]
*  If you look at the federal government, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7287.96s)]
*  it's defining quality is secrecy, right? [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7289.24s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7291.24s)]
*  Billion classified documents, why is that? [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7292.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7293.639999999999s)]
*  It's not good, it's never good. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7294.48s)]
*  Your kids behave like that, it's not good. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7295.32s)]
*  No. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7296.92s)]
*  They're using drugs or whatever, you know what I mean? [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7297.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7299.48s)]
*  They're having sex they shouldn't be having. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7300.32s)]
*  There's never a good reason for that kind of secrecy. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7301.28s)]
*  It's not privacy, it's secrecy. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7303.8s)]
*  So. Right, yes. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7304.92s)]
*  And there's something about Trump [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7306.16s)]
*  that makes everybody nervous that he might say [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7307.24s)]
*  more of what he knows than he should. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7311.04s)]
*  Well, they don't control him, obviously. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7312.36s)]
*  So that's very nerve wracking. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7314.76s)]
*  I mean, how much do you think that they're just worried [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7316.4400000000005s)]
*  that he's gonna pull out of NATO? [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7318.360000000001s)]
*  How much of it is that? [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7320.84s)]
*  That's, I mean, of course, that's in my daily prayers [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7321.96s)]
*  that he would do that. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7325.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think he's in danger doing that. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7326.24s)]
*  I certainly hope so, but I think it's even more fundamental. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7329.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like this guy could say the truth. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7332.64s)]
*  Because Trump is not much of a liar actually [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7336.360000000001s)]
*  by Washington Sanders, he's an exaggerator, of course, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7338.92s)]
*  but actually his defining quality is like saying the truth. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7342.4s)]
*  Is being honest about kind of the issues. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7345.4s)]
*  The big issues. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7347.24s)]
*  So what do you, so you think he knows what it is? [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7348.08s)]
*  The UAP stuff? Yeah. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7352.92s)]
*  I do think that, yes. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7353.92s)]
*  And you think it's an NHI? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7355.0s)]
*  You know, he hasn't told me, but yeah, [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7358.48s)]
*  I do think he knows, I'm pretty sure, pretty sure he knows. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7361.32s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure that everybody I've ever spoken to [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7364.36s)]
*  who I think knows a lot more than I do, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7366.92s)]
*  I mean, what does it mean to know? [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7369.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, do we really know anything? [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7370.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7373.08s)]
*  I'm not sure anybody fully understands this [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7373.92s)]
*  or even partially understands it, [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7375.76s)]
*  but the people who I'm confident [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7376.88s)]
*  have a lot more information than I have, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7380.04s)]
*  to a person are very, very uncomfortable about it. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7382.88s)]
*  Not in public and private, which is another tell. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7386.599999999999s)]
*  I've just, I mean, you've talked to a lot of people. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7390.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, it's very, yeah. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7393.16s)]
*  I mean, I say my prayers, I'm still Christian. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7396.36s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's interesting, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7399.16s)]
*  Joe, when I was on Joe Rogan's podcast last time, [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7401.84s)]
*  I mean, here, you know, Joe was like, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7404.48s)]
*  I think that they're extraterrestrials. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7406.599999999999s)]
*  You know, he's openly saying that. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7408.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7409.5199999999995s)]
*  So you kind of- [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7410.36s)]
*  It's not the case. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7411.2s)]
*  Well, okay, or NHI, I guess NHI. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7412.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7413.16s)]
*  But I mean, here, you and Joe are like the two big, [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7414.639999999999s)]
*  most influential podcasters in the country [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7416.96s)]
*  and you both think that it's not just a government [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7419.44s)]
*  secret tech or that it's not just plasmas. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7422.639999999999s)]
*  And Joe's very close with Elon, loves Elon, you know, [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7425.6s)]
*  like me, and I think probably like you, [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7430.4400000000005s)]
*  believes that Elon deserves a huge amount of credit [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7432.080000000001s)]
*  for saving free speech in this country. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7434.52s)]
*  Elon says there's nothing there, never sees anything, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7438.56s)]
*  and they've got an amazing rocket system [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7442.160000000001s)]
*  that sees a lot of things. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7443.96s)]
*  Not sure, I've talked to Elon about this a number of times [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7445.080000000001s)]
*  and I'm not sure he says that. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7447.76s)]
*  Okay, I thought he did say that. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7449.04s)]
*  I thought he said if I see, if there's any aliens- [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7450.400000000001s)]
*  He jokes about it, which is a tell. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7452.360000000001s)]
*  Trump does too. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7455.6s)]
*  And they joke in the same way. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7457.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, of course I love them both, obviously, [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7459.04s)]
*  and I feel like, you know, I feel like they both [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7461.8s)]
*  have really been great for this country, you know, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7465.76s)]
*  net-net, as they say, but no, they joke about it [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7468.64s)]
*  in the same way that a lot of people joke about. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7472.080000000001s)]
*  They're like, no, there are no flying saucers from Mars. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7474.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7476.64s)]
*  Of course they're not from Mars. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7477.4800000000005s)]
*  They're not from another planet. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7478.320000000001s)]
*  They're from here, they've always been here. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7479.92s)]
*  These are spiritual entities. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7481.96s)]
*  This is my view and I sincerely believe it. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7482.96s)]
*  Can't prove it. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7484.96s)]
*  But since you asked, so he is, [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7486.32s)]
*  I've never heard Elon say that's not true. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7488.08s)]
*  Be dismissive. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7490.76s)]
*  That there's nothing there. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7491.72s)]
*  He just said that we monitor space. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7492.84s)]
*  That's what they do, right? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7495.2s)]
*  And this is self-evident. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7496.56s)]
*  If there were, there've been so many sightings [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7498.28s)]
*  in this country and around the world [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7501.0s)]
*  that if they were from another galaxy far, far away, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7502.56s)]
*  there would be some satellite evidence of that. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7506.0s)]
*  They'd be picked up coming into our atmosphere. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7509.88s)]
*  And of course that's not, as far as I know, true. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7512.16s)]
*  But we do have some photos. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7515.8s)]
*  I mean, there's that one photo of the one, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7516.64s)]
*  I can't remember, it's like, [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7518.2s)]
*  it's in the James Fox documentary. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7519.4800000000005s)]
*  So there are some of those, apparently. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7521.16s)]
*  Coming through space in here. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7523.2s)]
*  And certainly I've been told there's a lot more [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7524.28s)]
*  of those photos and images. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7526.16s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, there's also- [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7527.32s)]
*  It would not surprise me though. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7528.16s)]
*  I mean, it's clear that these things reside, you know, [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7529.400000000001s)]
*  deep in the earth, under the water and in the atmosphere. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7532.72s)]
*  So, I mean, that's- [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7536.92s)]
*  And why the elusiveness then? [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7538.32s)]
*  Why the secrecy? [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7539.64s)]
*  Well, that's the question. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7540.92s)]
*  Why don't they wanna- [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7541.76s)]
*  That is the question. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7542.6s)]
*  Everybody who, again, [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7543.44s)]
*  I don't know what anybody really knows. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7545.2s)]
*  I don't know anything. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7546.679999999999s)]
*  I just wanna start every sentence by admitting [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7547.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know anything. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7549.44s)]
*  I don't know what happens when you die. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7551.08s)]
*  I don't know how the brain works. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7552.639999999999s)]
*  I don't know anything. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7554.44s)]
*  I don't know what sleep is for. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7555.28s)]
*  None of us do. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7557.28s)]
*  That's a really interesting one. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7558.16s)]
*  That's a surprisingly interesting one, actually. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7559.5599999999995s)]
*  But it's such a, it's so revealing [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7561.799999999999s)]
*  of the limits of human knowledge. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7563.759999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, science has solved this. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7565.12s)]
*  Really? [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7566.799999999999s)]
*  What's sleep for? [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7567.62s)]
*  Tell me how that benefits us. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7568.799999999999s)]
*  Sleep, really? [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7570.16s)]
*  But anyway, so I just always wanna say [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7572.08s)]
*  and remind myself of the limits of my knowledge, [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7574.5199999999995s)]
*  which are profound. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7576.36s)]
*  So I don't know anything. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7577.2s)]
*  But once again, every person I've talked to [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7578.48s)]
*  who I believe has deeper knowledge [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7581.12s)]
*  on this question than I have, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7584.04s)]
*  has seemed burdened by it. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7585.64s)]
*  Have you noticed this? [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7588.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7589.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's not fun anymore. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7590.36s)]
*  And these are not people who are making money from it. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7591.2s)]
*  No. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7593.08s)]
*  These are not people trying to get famous from it. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7593.92s)]
*  These are people who just seem to have this knowledge [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7595.2s)]
*  and they're bothered by it. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7597.2s)]
*  So that's- [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7598.4s)]
*  And I don't think it's to cover up [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7599.24s)]
*  a secret weapons program. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7601.04s)]
*  I mean, in other words, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7602.2s)]
*  I don't think that's how you would do it. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7603.04s)]
*  It's so like, yeah, I don't believe it. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7604.56s)]
*  A secret weapons program. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7607.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7608.56s)]
*  Sorry, it's much deeper. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7609.4s)]
*  Weapons programs come and go. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7610.96s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7612.64s)]
*  Weapons that we thought were fearsome [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7613.48s)]
*  when I was a child are a joke now. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7614.84s)]
*  We're watching weapons technology change so fast [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7616.48s)]
*  in the Ukraine war [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7619.4s)]
*  that people can't even get their brains around. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7620.24s)]
*  And you wouldn't need this elaborate. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7621.6s)]
*  And also if you're doing passage material, [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7623.36s)]
*  just to go back to those cases, [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7625.5199999999995s)]
*  why would it be that? [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7626.84s)]
*  And why would there be so much of it? [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7628.04s)]
*  Why wouldn't it be something? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7629.839999999999s)]
*  Anyway, it's a very curiously large body of passage material [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7632.28s)]
*  on this particular topic. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7637.679999999999s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7639.24s)]
*  Well, that's what I was saying. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7640.28s)]
*  Like I do think all the puzzle pieces [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7641.44s)]
*  are sort of in plain sight. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7644.32s)]
*  Did you ask Putin about it? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7647.36s)]
*  I did not ask Putin about it. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7651.12s)]
*  I would never have done it on air [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7653.759999999999s)]
*  because I did ask him a bunch of questions off camera [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7656.16s)]
*  about, you know, he has access to, of course, [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7660.44s)]
*  he controls the Soviet archives, [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7662.8s)]
*  which and the Soviets are great archivists. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7664.36s)]
*  And we know that from the, you know, couple of, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7667.24s)]
*  I'm interested in Soviet leadership [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7669.639999999999s)]
*  and government and all that stuff. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7671.68s)]
*  There've been a couple of amazing books written. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7672.5599999999995s)]
*  The Court of the Red Tsar being, [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7675.639999999999s)]
*  I think the greatest of them, about Stalin, for example. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7676.68s)]
*  And one thing you learned from me in the book [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7678.76s)]
*  is they kept records on everything, [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7680.2s)]
*  almost like the Nazis, like crazy level records. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7681.92s)]
*  And, you know, most of them have never been this close. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7685.4s)]
*  So I did have some questions for Putin about that, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7687.16s)]
*  about Rudolf Hess specifically. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7689.36s)]
*  It's one of the great stories in history [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7691.44s)]
*  that doesn't make any sense at all. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7693.2s)]
*  The number two guy in Nazi Germany flying into Scotland [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7695.12s)]
*  in a plane by himself and bailing out, you know, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7697.5199999999995s)]
*  right before the US entry into the war [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7700.32s)]
*  and had all these things to say that were wild. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7703.36s)]
*  And one of the things he apparently said in his debriefs [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7706.639999999999s)]
*  was he believed that Hitler was being influenced [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7708.96s)]
*  by demonic spirits that he had summoned through the occult. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7712.48s)]
*  Huh? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7716.28s)]
*  That's not worth knowing more about. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7717.639999999999s)]
*  I think. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7718.799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff on that. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7719.639999999999s)]
*  There's a lot, there's a lot, but Hess said that. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7720.48s)]
*  So I immediately asked Putin about that off camera. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7722.16s)]
*  I didn't want to seem like a wacko [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7724.44s)]
*  having unauthorized questions, but I did ask him about that. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7726.24s)]
*  He did not get a satisfactory answer, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7729.08s)]
*  but I did not ask him about UFOs. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7731.2s)]
*  Well, I thought also, you know, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7733.44s)]
*  you may have seen Marc Andreessen recently [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7734.719999999999s)]
*  say that when he met with White House officials [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7736.28s)]
*  who said that they wanted to take all the, [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7738.599999999999s)]
*  they wanted to take control over all AI, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7740.44s)]
*  that they said to him something like, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7743.16s)]
*  we've declassified whole areas of science since the 1950s. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7746.16s)]
*  And I was like, that just seemed like a reference [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7753.2s)]
*  to this stuff, at least to the anti-gravity, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7755.28s)]
*  if not to some of the UAP stuff. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7760.839999999999s)]
*  I think the modern Western mind, [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7763.879999999999s)]
*  the post-1945 Western mind is incapable [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7765.639999999999s)]
*  of understanding some of the stuff [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7768.16s)]
*  because we lack the language of metaphysics. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7769.16s)]
*  And I think that's just been a feature [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7774.08s)]
*  of human thinking from the cave period [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7776.68s)]
*  until we dropped the atom bomb, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7780.24s)]
*  in which case it just like turned off. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7781.84s)]
*  We're like, oh, only the material world is real, [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7783.24s)]
*  but no one else has ever thought that [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7785.12s)]
*  because that's not true. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7786.36s)]
*  Well, like for a hundred years, right? [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7787.2s)]
*  Really from Darwin, 150 years or something. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7788.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't think, I mean, even before the war, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7791.04s)]
*  before dropping those bombs, which really, [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7794.48s)]
*  I mean, I do think that's like the pivot point in history [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7798.92s)]
*  more than anything else, but yeah, [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7800.88s)]
*  there've been secular movements. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7802.400000000001s)]
*  Rich people always think they're God, [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7804.08s)]
*  and so they wanna eliminate any rivals from the public [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7805.52s)]
*  from the conversation, but those bombs, man, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7808.76s)]
*  everything changed, you don't think? [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7811.2s)]
*  Well, it sure seemed like it. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7813.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's a really positive side of it though, [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7815.84s)]
*  which is that we haven't had these awful wars. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7818.56s)]
*  Yes. Brutal. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7821.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, when you look at the death toll [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7822.280000000001s)]
*  that was going up and up and up from wars [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7823.96s)]
*  all throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, it's awful. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7825.8s)]
*  So they've spared us that, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7829.96s)]
*  but it took something apocalyptic. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7832.2s)]
*  Well, it's been 80 years, we'll see. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7834.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7836.56s)]
*  So last question, sorry, I've got it. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7837.76s)]
*  Can you imagine sitting next to me at dinner [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7840.320000000001s)]
*  like you never do? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7841.64s)]
*  So I never get anything done. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7842.4800000000005s)]
*  And you're, I think, [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7844.88s)]
*  one of the most knowledgeable people in the country [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7846.64s)]
*  on like all the most interesting topics. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7848.4400000000005s)]
*  So. Too kind. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7850.12s)]
*  No, it's just a fact. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7851.4800000000005s)]
*  In fact, if there's anything this conversation, I think, [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7853.12s)]
*  is like provoked in people, it's a desire to hear [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7855.2s)]
*  more Michael Schellenberger. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7857.2s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7858.36s)]
*  Do you think it's possible that what we're seeing in LA, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7860.2s)]
*  which does feel like the destruction [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7863.56s)]
*  of our second biggest city, [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7865.04s)]
*  from which maybe there's no recovery, I don't know, I hope, [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7868.2s)]
*  but do you think it's an act of war in some sense? [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7870.68s)]
*  You mean from a foreign power or? [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7877.76s)]
*  I do. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7879.44s)]
*  Oh. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7880.36s)]
*  Like what's the evidence for that? [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7881.48s)]
*  It happened. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7883.72s)]
*  And it happened between Trump's election [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7885.320000000001s)]
*  and his inauguration. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7887.56s)]
*  And it's just crazy. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7889.76s)]
*  The second Trump got elected, I had this instinct like, [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7891.08s)]
*  oh man, I bet a lot there's gonna be bad stuff [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7893.16s)]
*  that happens in the next two months. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7896.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, I was more struck by that on the UAP, [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7897.200000000001s)]
*  on the drone UAP. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7899.0s)]
*  Well, exactly, it's of a piece. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7900.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7902.0s)]
*  Bizarre Tesla explosion in Las Vegas. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7902.84s)]
*  Very weird. Mass shooting. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7905.84s)]
*  Like there's just, if there's a two month period [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7907.08s)]
*  in my whole life, 55 years, [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7910.0s)]
*  where more weird shit's been packed into two months. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7911.48s)]
*  I can't think of it. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7913.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7914.799999999999s)]
*  Can you? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7915.639999999999s)]
*  No, it's freaking me out a little bit. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7917.16s)]
*  Me too. Honestly. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7918.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, I spent a bunch of time on the levels burger. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7919.839999999999s)]
*  That's the guy that killed himself in the Tesla [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7923.24s)]
*  in Las Vegas. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7925.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, you definitely have cases of PTSD [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7926.96s)]
*  causing people to do things. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7930.639999999999s)]
*  And people are surprised by suicides, [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7932.16s)]
*  but yeah, it was a weird one. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7934.839999999999s)]
*  And I was skeptical of his emails, [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7936.5599999999995s)]
*  because he sent these emails to Sean Ryan, [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7938.32s)]
*  another excellent podcaster. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7940.8s)]
*  I think you've had him on or you've been on there. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7942.240000000001s)]
*  I was a friend of mine. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7943.84s)]
*  Just for the record, I consider him an honest. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7945.84s)]
*  Oh no, I did too. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7948.84s)]
*  I think Ryan is an honest man. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7949.68s)]
*  No, no, for sure. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7950.76s)]
*  Oh, he's a CIA operative. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7951.6s)]
*  Oh, shut up. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7952.4400000000005s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7953.280000000001s)]
*  I was like, I was like, [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7954.120000000001s)]
*  enjoyed it because I believe in Sean. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7955.280000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure he did not fake that. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7957.72s)]
*  So, and then the FBI did confirm [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7961.04s)]
*  that those emails were real. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7963.84s)]
*  On the other hand, that was a weird one too, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7965.320000000001s)]
*  because it felt like he was like, [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7966.88s)]
*  oh, those were Chinese drones. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7968.24s)]
*  They've mastered gravetic. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7971.16s)]
*  It just felt like he didn't really know [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7973.04s)]
*  what he was talking about either. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7974.679999999999s)]
*  So there's just a lot of people talking. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7975.5199999999995s)]
*  Have you ever heard the word gravetic before? [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7977.88s)]
*  I mean, I thought it was anti-gravity is what I've heard. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7980.04s)]
*  But I never, well, you're a writer. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7983.36s)]
*  You're a word person. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7985.32s)]
*  I'd never heard that word or seen that word. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7986.36s)]
*  I felt like he was using it wrong. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7988.2s)]
*  That was my instinct. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7989.599999999999s)]
*  That was my thought too. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7990.44s)]
*  I looked it up. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7991.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7992.24s)]
*  No, I mean, I guess I look at it. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7993.08s)]
*  I just think Nietzsche really nailed it, [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7994.76s)]
*  which is that when people stop believing [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=7998.68s)]
*  in traditional religions, [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8002.4400000000005s)]
*  they unconsciously develop, [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8004.320000000001s)]
*  they develop new sense of guilt, [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8009.88s)]
*  a new vision of the apocalypse. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8011.88s)]
*  They invent a new soul. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8013.56s)]
*  I mean, people think that there's this thing called gender, [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8015.08s)]
*  which is separate from your body. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8016.92s)]
*  It's kind of like a soul. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8018.16s)]
*  My friend Abigail Schreier pointed that out. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8019.0s)]
*  And so we just ended up recreating Christianity, [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8022.32s)]
*  but in a deformed and deranged way. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8026.48s)]
*  And the emergent quality of it is this destructive fire. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8029.48s)]
*  Like you don't, it's actually more powerful [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8034.0s)]
*  because nobody got out there and said, [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8036.599999999999s)]
*  you know, let's let, I mean, [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8038.24s)]
*  somebody did say, let's let Malibu burn, [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8040.44s)]
*  but that was never like the explicit policy [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8042.36s)]
*  of the government of LA. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8044.44s)]
*  It's just something that emerges after years of budget cuts, [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8045.4s)]
*  after years of self-hating ideologies, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8049.32s)]
*  like DEI, like climate apocalypse, [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8053.0s)]
*  like the homeless apocalypse. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8054.32s)]
*  It's just emerges kind of deep from deep within us [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8056.5199999999995s)]
*  from some self-destructive part of us. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8060.5199999999995s)]
*  So for me, if there's a foreign invasion, [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8064.36s)]
*  it came through the human psyche, not from outside of it. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8066.12s)]
*  Michael Schellenberger, how can people find you? [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8069.8s)]
*  Public.News and at Schellenberger on X. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvqSncd4FY&t=8074.96s)]
