# Chris Cella: Opioids, Robbing the Mafia, Burning Down the Entourage House, and How God Saved Him
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I)
*  You pepper sprayed a member of the Mexican mafia and stole his heroin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=0.0s)]
*  I sprayed him in the face with pepper spray and put something to his throat. Don't move. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  Making me tense, man. Just telling me this story. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=8.08s)]
*  And he had girls in his halfway houses that he was giving heroin, giving crack, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=10.16s)]
*  and pimping them out and then sending them back to treatment where they would ultimately fail their [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  drug test and have to go to detox. And guess who gets a kickback from the detox center? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=21.36s)]
*  No way. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=26.96s)]
*  It's a revolving door of suffering and just pain for the addict. But they're making money [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=27.92s)]
*  at every stop. This is disgusting. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=33.28s)]
*  And then she pulls out a handgun. Oh my god. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  And she's like, what the f*** are you doing in my house? My kids are in there. And I'm like, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=38.56s)]
*  oh my god, you have kids? If you have your kids sleeping in there, you're kind of a shitty mom. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=42.24s)]
*  So you insult the lady with the gun pointed at you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=46.56s)]
*  Yes, because- Because- [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  You got balls, I'll say that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=49.52s)]
*  Thanks for doing this, Chris. How long were you addicted to opioids? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=71.92s)]
*  So I was addicted to opioids from the age of 15 to 23, kind of on and off, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  in and out of rehab for those eight years. But yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=81.28s)]
*  15 to 23. Where'd you grow up? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=84.48s)]
*  So I grew up in, I was born in Dallas, grew up in South Orange County, moved there when I was five, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=87.76s)]
*  kind of bounced around, but all in kind of relatively the same area. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Southern California. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=96.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Southern California, Orange County. And my sister, or my family, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  addiction kind of just runs in my family. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=104.56s)]
*  Yeah, as it does many. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=106.16s)]
*  Yeah. Right? I do believe it is. There is a genetic component to kind of the addictive [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  personality, absolutely, 100%. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  You think? How much alcoholism is there in Israel? How much alcoholism is there in Sweden? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=116.4s)]
*  It's a big difference. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=124.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So growing up, my dad was, he was a general counsel at an oil company in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=125.92s)]
*  Texas. So he was traveling a lot, and he was also a heavy drinker. He is not the type of person who [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=135.76s)]
*  needed to wake up and drink in the morning to function, but he would go on vendors for days, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=142.56s)]
*  weeks at a time. And then my mom, she was a long distance runner and she had a diving accident [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=148.32s)]
*  that left her basically, she was a victim of Big Pharma's push in the early to mid 90s for oxy [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=157.76s)]
*  cotton, and then eventually fentanyl. And this little pathetic pill pushing quack is giving her [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=165.2s)]
*  just massive amounts of oxy cotton. And she liked the way she, she hated the way it felt. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=172.24s)]
*  And she's like, I don't like this. It's making me like comatose. And the doctor's like, well, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=176.96s)]
*  you need to keep taking it. And so she decided to flush them down the toilet once. And she went into [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  excruciating withdrawal. And I'll touch more on withdrawal later, but it's, yeah, she, so she- [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Were your parents married? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=195.44s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Yes, they were married. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=196.8s)]
*  So your dad's the general counsel of a big company. Your mom's a distance runner. So these are [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=198.32s)]
*  like competent people who got their act together. These are not like, this is not the junkie profile. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=202.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah. Like my father, he was, he graduated college at 19. And he went to Columbia [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=208.24s)]
*  law school. I mean, you know, so- Oh, wow. Okay. I'm sorry. Cause I think that, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=216.4s)]
*  I think it's important to set this in a socioeconomic frame. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=221.28s)]
*  Yeah. Cause there's, yeah. Addiction does not, you know, it does not, it doesn't matter whether [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=224.96s)]
*  you're rich, poor, black, white, whatever, you know, it's indiscriminatory. So- [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=229.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=234.72s)]
*  So yeah, my- [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=236.56s)]
*  So this doctor keeps pushing opioids on your mom. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=237.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=241.04s)]
*  By the way, to be a distance runner, I admire that, but it suggests like true self-discipline, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=242.16s)]
*  high level of awareness of your body. I mean, who's a distance runner, you know, only people who are [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=251.12s)]
*  very, very into fitness and very, very kind of like batten down people. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=258.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=263.12s)]
*  Correct? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=263.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, my mom was absolutely, you know, one of the most disciplined people that I've ever [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=264.0s)]
*  met. And- [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=271.36s)]
*  You kind of have to be. Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, a lot of long distance running to me is absolutely sounds like torture. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=272.88s)]
*  It is torture. But it's highly impressive. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=277.36s)]
*  Yeah. No, it is absolutely. And so, you know, she had these multiple surgeries that only [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=279.68s)]
*  exacerbated the issue and- [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=284.8s)]
*  A neck injury? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=286.72s)]
*  Yeah. A neck injury that she got from- it wasn't related to her long distance running, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=287.6s)]
*  but it was a diving incident. She hit her neck on the diving board. And so yeah, this guy's- [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  first, she's pushing Oxycontin on her. And then he says, okay, well, let's try something different. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=300.24s)]
*  It might be less like, you know, less addictive possibly, you know, because fentanyl is brand new [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=304.48s)]
*  and, you know, might make you feel a little bit better to where you can function throughout the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  day. So he puts her on fentanyl and fentanyl is so- [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=314.96s)]
*  I'm sorry to laugh. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=318.0s)]
*  No, no, it's- I mean, it's- yeah, you have to laugh. Otherwise you'll cry because it's like [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=319.28s)]
*  fentanyl is the most- so powerful that it has to be administered in micrograms. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=328.08s)]
*  Like, you know, like the 25 micrograms, whereas most drugs are administered in milligrams. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=328.24s)]
*  So like that just shows you how potent- [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=332.96s)]
*  How many kids does your mom have? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  Three. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=337.44s)]
*  So she's got three kids. She's married to a general counsel company. She lives in Southern [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  California. She's a distance runner. All of a sudden she's on fentanyl. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=341.84s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, no, she will. She was living in Dallas when she became addicted to fentanyl, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=345.52s)]
*  addicted to the Oxy at least. And then when we moved to Southern California, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=352.4s)]
*  we moved to Southern California. My dad started his own practice with his brother. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=356.88s)]
*  They were both lawyers. So, and then, yeah, so my sister, and then my sister, she had a serious [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=360.64s)]
*  issue with bulimia and anorexia from the age of 10 to 28. Like so serious that, you know, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=372.08s)]
*  her potassium levels were so low that ambulances at our home were like a regular occurrence. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=378.88s)]
*  And there was multiple times when they said, you know, your daughter might make it, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=384.0s)]
*  might not make it to, you know, to my father. And so witnessing all of this at a very young age, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  and again, I'm not trying- again, I just want to like preface. This is not an excuse for my actions. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  Like I own everything that I did and all the terrible things that I did. It was not, but I [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  think that the chaos that I had, that I, you know, basically I didn't have the necessary things like [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=401.28s)]
*  structure and discipline that I think are so important for everyone, but especially for people [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  with addictive personalities to have that, you know, that rigid kind of, I'm going to wake up, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=414.88s)]
*  I'm going to make my bed, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. And so like my parents, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  I knew my parents loved me. Like my parents, they, I was never, you know, short on that, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  but they were so busy trying to deal with my sister and, you know, and their own issues. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=431.2s)]
*  My father, he's been off, he stopped drinking. He just, cold turkey, stopped drinking for, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  it's been 25 years now. Yeah. And, you know, he never went to AA or anything like that. And so, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=442.08s)]
*  again, it's, you know, addiction or, you know, treatment can be as simple as, you know, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=449.52s)]
*  going to therapy. It doesn't have to include, you know, rehab and all these different things. But, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=455.76s)]
*  so yeah, my sister, your mom, she, so she eventually switched over to Suboxone from [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=462.08s)]
*  fentanyl and then she weaned herself off of that. So now she's, yeah, totally, and Suboxone is a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=471.28s)]
*  miracle drug. I mean, compared to like the alternative, which is methadone, which is so, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=477.12s)]
*  so addictive. It gets into your bone marrow. I mean, the withdrawals from that, I've heard are [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=482.72s)]
*  much worse than, you know, your average opiate or even heroin, just because it's more drawn out. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=490.0s)]
*  And yeah, terrible. What a nightmare. So she got better. Yes. And your dad got better, but you grew [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  up in an environment where there was a lot of this going on. Yeah. And so, yeah, and lacking [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=506.8s)]
*  that structure, it made me, you know, I think it led to a sense of low self-esteem and the constant [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=513.04s)]
*  need for the approval of others. Like I look back now and I'm like, you know, why the fuck do I, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=519.92s)]
*  did I care so much about what other people thought? And it's, I guess, you know, I can't, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=526.4s)]
*  but after years of therapy, they've kind of pinpointed as to like, you know, you're quote [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=533.84s)]
*  unquote inner child, didn't get enough emotional nourishment, so to speak. And so yeah, you know, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=537.6s)]
*  I was so constantly trying desperately to fit in. So, you know, when I got into middle school, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=543.84s)]
*  high school, and I was, you know, an honor roll student, very, very, you know, I was very, you [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=550.16s)]
*  know, I have a high IQ. I was blessed with that. But once I got into like college where you actually [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=558.56s)]
*  have to start kind of trying a little bit, like algebra two and whatnot, I was like, you know, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=563.3599999999999s)]
*  because I started hanging out with kids who were smoking weed, drinking and smoking cigarettes. So [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=568.4s)]
*  not that I necessarily wanted to smoke weed, drink and smoke cigarettes, but that's what they [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=574.56s)]
*  were doing. So I wanted, you know, I wanted their approval. I wanted to fit in. I wanted to be a [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=578.8s)]
*  part of the cool crowd. And so I started drinking, you know, smoking cigarettes and smoking weed. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=583.68s)]
*  And so that went on for, you know, I quit the wrestling team. I, you know, I pretty much [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=588.8s)]
*  abandoned everything that, you know, was positive, you know, all the positive things that I was doing [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=595.8399999999999s)]
*  for my life and just kind of became a stoner. And, and, you know, I know a lot of kids who [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=600.8s)]
*  were potheads in high school, you know, that I'm friends with that are more sick of school than [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=607.3599999999999s)]
*  I today. So I'm not, you know, trashing them at all. But I mean, then what happened was it progressed [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=611.28s)]
*  to the, cause I was in, you know, advanced placement classes. So I was in like algebra two [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=617.6s)]
*  as a sophomore where, you know, I was, it was mostly juniors and seniors in the class. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=623.76s)]
*  And so I started hanging out with the juniors and seniors and they were doing, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=628.16s)]
*  it's called oxymorphone or O'Pana, they were, you know, snorting that, taking Xanax, pills, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=634.16s)]
*  stuff like that. And, and my stoner buddies- [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=640.8s)]
*  Where were they getting the pills? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=643.3599999999999s)]
*  So they were getting them, there was pretty much, we had like one source and he was a guy that just [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  lived in, down the street in an apartment complex. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=652.0s)]
*  It's always a guy in an apartment complex, isn't it? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=657.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've been to those apartment complexes. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=657.92s)]
*  And he, his grandmother was getting prescription, getting these prescription drugs and just had like [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=659.5999999999999s)]
*  a boatload of them. So, you know, he would sell them for 60 bucks a pop and, you know, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  we would buy them. But eventually, you know, that it becomes too expensive, the pill habit [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=673.76s)]
*  becomes too expensive. And that's why so many people transition to heroin. But, you know, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=680.0799999999999s)]
*  even my stoner friends were like, hey, you should like, you should try to steer clear of those guys [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=684.72s)]
*  over there. And I'm like, okay, yeah, I'm going to take your heaping loads of moral condemnation, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=689.12s)]
*  stoner. But in reality, it's like, when the potheads are telling you that to stay away from [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=693.36s)]
*  these kids, you know, they're bad. No, no, that's right. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  Like, yeah. And so, you know, of course, you know, my, again, that low self-esteem, that desire to fit [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=701.92s)]
*  in started using pills and opiates in particular. They took away that feeling of that, like that [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=708.96s)]
*  low self-worth. I felt I was confident. I, you know, I felt great at the beginning, in the beginning, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=719.76s)]
*  in the very early stages of my addiction. So like the first, you know, two, three months. And I had [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=726.64s)]
*  a job, I was a telemarketer at a golf club selling quote unquote, custom made clubs. They're literally [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=731.36s)]
*  made in a warehouse underneath the call center by illegals. And they're using their graphite or steel, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=738.88s)]
*  and they might give you extra grips on the clubs. That's the extent of the quote unquote, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=743.84s)]
*  the customization. Yeah. But comparable to the tailor-made R11, yeah, okay. Yeah, right. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=748.4s)]
*  So you're selling custom, faux custom made golf clubs from a call center. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=754.48s)]
*  Yeah. And, and, you know, go in the car, do a line of O'Pona and come back in. And it's just like, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=759.84s)]
*  oh my gosh, you know, I have more confidence and I'm pushing, pushing harder on the sales and things [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=766.88s)]
*  and my sales numbers are going up. So I'm like, why would I stop when this is like, I feel great [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=772.08s)]
*  about myself? I'm performing better at work. Yes. So, you know, I saw it as like, there's like, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=779.6s)]
*  there's no downside until totally fair question. And by the way, there have been a lot of, as you [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=785.84s)]
*  know, artists, jazz musicians, you know, who used opioids, because they thought it increased their, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=791.7600000000001s)]
*  you know, ability and enhanced their performance. Yeah. And I think, you know, it, it, to an extent, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=798.32s)]
*  it can, but that is short-lived. It is not, you know, it's temporary because especially with [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=804.32s)]
*  opiates, they, again, they can, what they did, they literally, they erode your soul and you're [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=810.48s)]
*  eventually going to run out of money and find, and you're going to have to get desperate. And so. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=816.6400000000001s)]
*  So what happened in your case? You started by doing a line in your car during work. Yeah. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=822.4000000000001s)]
*  And, and it kind of just progressed, you know, I was like doing like, you know, one, one pill, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=827.12s)]
*  140 milligram pill every couple days to two every couple days to, you know, and just going up and [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=832.8s)]
*  up and the cost was getting too expensive. Why, why did you use more? You developed a tolerance? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=839.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You quickly develop a tolerance and, yeah, and you just need more and more to get [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=847.76s)]
*  to that. Cause you're always chasing that first high. You're never going to get it again, but [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=854.64s)]
*  that's what like, you know, the chasing the dragon, you're always trying to get to that level, but [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=859.36s)]
*  you're never going to get there. Right. No, I think it's, I'm, yeah. I mean, I think every [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=864.96s)]
*  childhood weed smoker remembers that first time when you just like burst into laughter hysterically [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=870.16s)]

*  And it's like, it's true. It is fun. I mean, that's truly fun, but that doesn't mean that [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=879.44s)]
*  but that doesn't ever happen again. Yeah, no, it's and, and you, you, you're so desperate to try to [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=883.76s)]
*  get back there and, and that kind of, you know, the whole like, you know, addiction makes you [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=888.9599999999999s)]

*  insanity, trying things over and over again, expecting the different results, especially [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=903.8399999999999s)]
*  when you get into the point where you're like, you're trying to get sober and like, okay, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  yeah, this hasn't worked 15 times. Maybe it'll work the 16th. Why? And so, but yeah, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=912.16s)]
*  so I was, yeah, so it progressed very quickly. So you're in like 10th grade at this point? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=919.4399999999999s)]

*  It's like, basically, if you get like booted out of, you know, a regular high school, it's kind of [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=953.04s)]
*  like, it's kind of like a way to get a, get a diploma without having to get a GED, but like, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=958.96s)]

*  able to do that because that was almost, I don't want to say almost as hard, but very difficult. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=999.36s)]
*  And, you know, trying to get rid of that addiction, you know, compared to my opiate addiction, but, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1002.9599999999999s)]

*  So did you have to go with him to South LA? Yeah, we would drive him. He didn't have a car. So, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1188.72s)]
*  you know, I would drive him in my 1998 Jeep and we'd all just pile in there. And this, the feds [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1194.64s)]

*  like, all right, meat. And it would be like one of three freeway exits, you know, right in that area [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1225.44s)]
*  and like always like a fast food parking lot, something like that, you know. What town? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1230.48s)]

*  the crazier things about this whole, this whole experience. So the runner that I had the most [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1278.0s)]
*  contact with, he was, you know, he's a cool guy, just this little Hispanic guy, you know, I mean, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1283.36s)]

*  finally he was like, Hey, you know what, you no longer have to call boss. You can just hear, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1300.24s)]
*  I'll give you my personal line. And you can just call me and then, you know, have to save, save you [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1303.6000000000001s)]
*  the hassle of going through the whole, the whole process. I was like, Oh, cool, man. Thanks. And [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1308.8s)]
*  so, you know, we developed a kind of, you know, friendship, I guess, and [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1314.0s)]
*  it's probably the wildest story that I have. So we, so my friends from South Orange County, again, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1317.52s)]
*  very affluent, you know, I don't know if you've heard of like Nellie Gale in, in South Orange [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1325.12s)]
*  County. It's like, it's like one of the ritziest neighborhoods in the country. It's got like horse [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1329.52s)]
*  trails running through it, you know, and, you know, the houses are like at a minimum, you know, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1335.84s)]
*  $5 million. So yeah, it's a very nice area, very affluent area. And that's where pretty much all [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1340.72s)]
*  my friends lived. And, but this girl we knew, her uncle was, he owned the house. Have you seen the [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1346.72s)]
*  show Entrage? Have you heard of it? Yeah. Yeah. So he owned the house that at least like two seasons [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1354.64s)]
*  of the show were filmed in. And she's like, yeah, we can go up there for the weekend. I was like, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1360.32s)]
*  awesome. And so it's funny, we drive all the way to Beverly Hills with like two and a half hour [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1364.64s)]
*  drive and up this private road to this, you know, this beautiful mansion, the door's locked. And [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1369.3600000000001s)]
*  she kind of lied or, you know, misled us about having permission to go to the house. And so I'm [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1374.72s)]
*  like, are you fucking kidding me? And anyways, excuse me. So I ended up finding, I saw like a [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1380.96s)]
*  door sized window, like on the side of the house. And so I maneuvered my way up there, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1387.28s)]
*  pushed on the door and it just popped open. And I was like waiting for an alarm to go off. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1393.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. So I walk in, open the front door and, and we're in. And, and then I was like, oh man, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1398.0s)]
*  I really need some, some heroin, but I don't want to drive down to Southgate, you know. And so I [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1404.48s)]
*  called the guy and I was like, Hey man, we've got a huge mansion. You know, there's only like seven [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1410.24s)]
*  of us. This is why you don't let your niece bust into your house with her junkie buddies. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1416.24s)]
*  We'll just wait. And I was like, yeah, you know, if you want to, if you can, you know, I know you [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1420.96s)]
*  don't typically typically do deliveries, but if you could bring me an order, you know, you're welcome [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1427.28s)]
*  to stay and bring whomever you want. So he brings like two, two big, two big Mexican dudes and like [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1431.52s)]
*  10 big booty Latina, beautiful, beautiful chicks. Like, yeah. And a candy dish with all these [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1438.16s)]
*  different pills, Valium, Xanax, you know, Oxy's, just all that. And at least an eight ball of Coke, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1446.72s)]
*  a giant bag of Coke. And that was, those were just party favors. And he brought me my order, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1455.36s)]
*  obviously. But, and so we spent the night partying, you know, hanging out in the indoor pool, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1459.28s)]
*  you know, doing lines off of, you know, girl's stomachs. And it was a wild, crazy time. I mean, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1467.84s)]
*  it was like literally like the show Entourage, but like junkie version just going on. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1474.32s)]
*  Oh, unbelievable. Did the uncle ever come back? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1479.92s)]
*  Well, so the next morning and thank God. Were you in high school at this point? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1483.92s)]
*  Yeah, I was, I was 16, I think. It's so like, because I was going back and trying to like, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1488.88s)]
*  remember things. And it's like, some of it is so blurry, that it's hard to like, wait, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1496.5600000000002s)]
*  when how old was I and have to like, like, I grew up in that area. So I know what you're talking about. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1501.2s)]
*  And so, yeah, the next morning, myself and a few other people leave. And [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1507.2s)]
*  did you sleep at all? Or just play through? No, no, I didn't sleep for a second. And yeah, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1515.12s)]
*  left the next morning with a few of my buddies and, and the game bangers departed. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1521.9199999999998s)]
*  And the big booty Latina girls? Yes, yes, they left as well. And so, you know, I go back to [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1527.76s)]
*  Orange County. And the next day, a police officer comes to our house. And it's like a female [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1535.12s)]
*  investigator. And she's like, asked me questions like, were you at this house and blah, blah, blah. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1545.84s)]
*  And I was like, I was there on she's like, we're either like Saturday, I was like, no, I was there [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1549.76s)]
*  Friday. I was like, I was there Friday. I was told we were allowed to be there because I thought it [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1554.1599999999999s)]
*  was breaking entering. That's what I assumed. And so I was like, I was told we were supposed to be [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1559.12s)]
*  there allowed to be there. And, you know, so and she's like, well, you're not aware that, that [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1562.9599999999998s)]
*  portion of the house was burned down. And I'm like, No, what are you talking about? And so she [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1570.32s)]
*  proceeds to tell me the story. Apparently, some of the other people that the girl invited out for [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1577.44s)]
*  the next night, one person got really high fell asleep with like a frozen pizza in the oven or [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1584.56s)]
*  something like that started a fire. And instead of like trying to put out they just left. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1591.92s)]
*  And drug addicts are all the same. And so there's like literally smoke billowing from this and it's [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1600.16s)]
*  like on a hill like to it. So like you can see it from like, like a very far away. It is called [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1605.52s)]
*  Beverly Hills. Yeah, exactly. And so like they're driving down the hill as the fire, you know, the [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1613.92s)]
*  ambulance and the cops are coming up the hill and the cop flips a you and he's like, because it's a [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1623.52s)]
*  private road and only leads to that house. And so they're like, Are you leaving that house? So like, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1627.92s)]
*  no, you know, idiots, no, of course not. We weren't there, you know, lying, lying, lying. And then [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1633.2s)]
*  the cops are like, come on. So you know, that and the I think one of them ended up getting charged [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1638.48s)]
*  with like fleeing the scene of a crime or something like that. But nothing serious came out of it. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1647.1200000000001s)]
*  But yeah, it was wild. And like, when she told me that I was like, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1652.4s)]
*  How did they know you were there? Because the the house owner basically gave her a list of everyone [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1657.52s)]
*  who was there. Like the girl who took us out there basically gave the investors. But it was her uncle's [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1663.52s)]
*  house. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he owned it. So as you're doing lines off the navels of big booty latinas [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1669.1200000000001s)]
*  with your gangbanger heroin dealer buddy in some girl's uncle's house where entourage was filmed, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1678.8s)]
*  what are your parents thinking at this point of like what you're doing? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1687.2s)]
*  Well, my parents, you know, God bless them. They're so naive. And like in my in my dad, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1691.68s)]
*  you know, had this consistent belief that, you know, our kids will do the right thing because [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1698.0s)]
*  it's the right thing to do, not because of the consequence that could come from it. And, you [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1703.6000000000001s)]
*  know, as, as, you know, as noble as that is, it's just it doesn't work. You know, you, you have to [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1708.4s)]
*  have consequences. Otherwise, you will run rampant and think you can do whatever you want. Yeah. And [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1714.0800000000002s)]
*  that's how it is. It's not judge. I grew up around, I mean, they sound like Southern Californians in [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1719.76s)]
*  their attitude that way. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, yeah, my dad was just, you know, very, you know, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1724.0800000000002s)]
*  had a very strong moral conviction that, you know, he believed just was passed on to us. And so [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1729.2800000000002s)]
*  so my parents were again, you know, had no idea what was going on until [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1736.64s)]
*  kind of another story, basically, long story short, I had a friend who was put into a coma. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1746.0s)]
*  We were at a party and this guy, this guy came out really angry and just punched my friend in [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1752.96s)]
*  the face. He fell, hit his head, put into a coma. And he wakes up three weeks later, and my mom is [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1758.0s)]
*  there. I wasn't there. My mom was there. And she and he says, Patty, you need to get Chris away from [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1765.04s)]
*  and she named out, she named, you know, some of the kids that I was associating with. And she said, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1770.0s)]
*  why, you know, because, you know, they're at my house and they're there. That was the first thing [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1776.0s)]
*  you said when he came out of a coma. Yes. Yes. God exists. Yeah. Yeah. God bless him. Really. It was. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1779.36s)]
*  And then of course, you know, at the time, I was like that, you know, snitch, you know, that kind [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1788.6399999999999s)]
*  of mentality is like, why are you trying to rain on my parade? You know, I'm just having a good time. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1794.16s)]
*  And but yeah, you know, I mean, my friends tried several, like, you know, my, my, my, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1799.8400000000001s)]
*  my quote unquote, stoner friends tried several interventions. And I was just like, you know, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1804.64s)]
*  extremely defensive and like, who are you people to tell me anything, you know? And, you know, but [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1811.6000000000001s)]
*  again, they had my best interest at heart. And of course, and, and, you know, many of those people, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1818.96s)]
*  I'm still in contact with today and I'm so grateful that they, you know, took the time [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1823.28s)]
*  and the effort to try to save me from myself. Incredible. Are you still in, are you still in [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1829.84s)]
*  high school at this point? Are you going to class? Are you? Yeah, going to class, you know, leaving [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1835.92s)]
*  early, stuff like that, you know, ditching, you know, like fifth period, fourth period to go hang [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1840.8s)]
*  out and, you know, how often are you doing heroin at this point? Every day. Every day. Yeah. What [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1845.76s)]
*  time of day? Like, what's the schedule for heroin addiction? So wake up. So I wasn't shooting it up [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1851.04s)]
*  yet. I was, I was smoking it at first. And how did you smoke it? So it's so in California, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1855.28s)]
*  heroin is mostly black tar heroin. And so basically from Asia, correct? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1862.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure. Okay. But yeah, it's like this like little black, yeah, like square. And so you put [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1869.52s)]
*  it on a piece of tinfoil, you put a lighter underneath it and you get a straw and it makes [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1877.28s)]
*  like it goes, it'll like trail down the tinfoil and you're in the smoke's coming up and you suck [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1883.52s)]
*  it through the straw with the lighter. And yeah, that was the, what's the high like from it? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1887.92s)]
*  I mean, just total euphoria. Again, you feel like you're on, you're on top of the world. You can, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1897.28s)]
*  it doesn't matter if you're literally, your life is falling down around you. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1903.44s)]
*  You don't care. It's like, you're fine. Everything is fine. Everything is great. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1907.92s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. So again, the insanity. How long does it last? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1912.96s)]
*  I'd say smoking it. And again, it all depends on like your tolerance level and things like that. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1920.0s)]
*  But let's say like, you know, probably three, four hours, five hours. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1924.8799999999999s)]
*  So while you're in high school, when are you smoking heroin? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1934.08s)]
*  So I would do it before school, you know, at home, in your bedroom. Yeah. Yeah. And [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1937.9199999999998s)]
*  your parents had no idea. Or in my shower. Yeah. And yeah, no, they didn't. Yeah, they didn't. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1945.12s)]
*  So when my friend got out of the coma, they, you know, started to kind of try to keep a closer eye [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1951.04s)]
*  on me. But I was still, you know, I was incredibly deceptive and very manipulative. Of course, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1956.8s)]
*  very manipulative and deceptive with my parents, making them think that, oh, these kids are great. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1964.96s)]
*  No, they're, they're actually the good kids. And God, when I think about like the torment that I [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1970.16s)]
*  put my parents through it, it's just where are you getting the money to buy all this heroin? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1977.92s)]
*  So I was, I had, I still had that job at the golf or selling golf clubs. And, and then I, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1982.72s)]
*  you know, I would occasionally take money from my parents, whatever I needed to do. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1993.68s)]
*  And then things I'm, you know, not proud of. I bet. But yeah, that's the nature of the disease [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=1999.2s)]
*  is you will do anything to get that, get that next fix. Yes. And so from smoking, it quickly [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2008.4s)]
*  deteriorated to, to shooting up because, you know, I'd say within like a month of smoking it, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2022.48s)]
*  I started shooting up because, you know, my couple of my buddies started doing it and they're like, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2030.64s)]
*  oh my gosh, dude, you only have to use like one fifth of the amount and you get like a high that's [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2035.2s)]
*  like 10 times better. I'm like, oh, great, save money. And yeah, I remember the first time, like [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2040.88s)]
*  I remember the first time my buddy and I did it, we looked it up how to inject, you know, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2047.1200000000001s)]
*  great Google search, how to inject heroin into your body. You Google searched it. Yeah. It's like, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2051.3599999999997s)]
*  they have like images of like, cause you're supposed to go like diagonally, like within, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2056.8799999999997s)]
*  you know, like just go straight down. Right. Like, cause you want to, you want to go into the vein. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2060.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. And then, and then you basically draw back the syringe and once you see blood, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2064.8799999999997s)]
*  cause you know that it's in the vein, then you inject it. But if you miss, it's really painful. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2069.92s)]
*  You basically, what happens is like, you don't, and you don't get that immediate euphoric rush [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2078.64s)]
*  that comes with shooting up. That's, that doesn't come with smoke, like smoking it. Yes, you get [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2084.08s)]
*  euphoria, but shooting up, it's like that it's instantaneous and it's, it hits so much harder. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2088.64s)]
*  It's like crack versus cocaine. Yes. Yeah. And yeah, it was just a very, very, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2095.2799999999997s)]
*  Can I just ask you from a perspective? So how long between you, you know, the moment you first [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2101.68s)]
*  crushed a pill and snorted it and the moment you first shot heroin, like how long was, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2107.7599999999998s)]
*  did that progression take? I would say less than a year, probably about like nine months. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2113.9199999999996s)]
*  Damn. That's a pretty speedy. Yeah. Progressive illness. Yeah. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2121.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So what was it like the first time you shot heroin? Where'd you do it? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2128.7200000000003s)]
*  It was at my buddy's house in Laguna Hills, in that neighborhood that I mentioned, Nellie Gill. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2133.28s)]
*  The $5 million house neighborhood. Yeah, exactly. And so yeah, we were [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2141.6800000000003s)]
*  in his room and I did it. And yeah, again, it's that just this overwhelming sense of euphoria and [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2148.32s)]
*  yeah, everything is wonderful. Even if, you know, your, even if your life sucks. And, and [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2156.24s)]
*  again, I understand why a lot of, you know, like homeless people do drugs. It's like, because [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2163.7599999999998s)]
*  their life is literally just in shambles. And, you know, so, I mean, yeah, they're so broken. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2167.84s)]
*  There's no way to fix it. This is their thinking. So like, this is the escape. Yeah. So what's the [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2172.24s)]
*  point? Yeah, exactly. Why not just live in like a, you know, almost like a metaverse, you know, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2176.4s)]
*  kind of. Yes, exactly. Nicely put. Thank you. So yeah, so I went to like, probably, I would say, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2181.44s)]
*  not exaggerating, over 10 rehab centers in California. Wait, so how did you get, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2191.44s)]
*  okay, so you start shooting heroin, how did you get busted? How did you wind up going to rehab? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2195.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So I was, so I was shooting up on a daily basis. And I actually started going to [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2201.84s)]
*  a continuation school because I was just, I stopped going to class. My grades were too low. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2210.6400000000003s)]
*  And, you know, I basically got kicked out of school. And so I was at a continuation school. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2218.2400000000002s)]
*  You wind up in like, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2222.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. The place I mock, the place I would ridicule and mock, like, and then I'm now, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2224.4s)]
*  I'm one of them. Was your junkie friend still there? The guy who first turned you on to the [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2229.12s)]
*  deal? No, because he was, he was like, much older. Yeah. Or like, yeah, he was a, yeah, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2235.52s)]
*  he was a senior when I like, I was a sophomore and he, and he barely attended, like, I saw him a few [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2241.6s)]
*  times on campus, but he barely went to school even when he was at continuation school. So yeah. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2246.16s)]
*  And yeah, we really didn't associate with that guy other than just to go buy drugs. But, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2250.64s)]
*  because he was not exactly, you know, a fun person to be around. And so I, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2255.4399999999996s)]
*  doing drugs, doing, or doing, shooting up heroin before school. And for some reason, that day, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2262.7999999999997s)]
*  I decided to take my, take all my drugs with me. I had a little like, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2268.56s)]
*  Ziploc packet with my syringe, my, you know, my, what I use to tie off, you know, all my equipment. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2274.08s)]
*  Where'd you get the syringes by the way? So there are certain pharmacies that will, you know, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2282.56s)]
*  if you say, you know, my, my grandmother's a diabetic or whatever that, and I think nowadays [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2287.92s)]
*  they just give them to you in a lot of places, especially like Northern California. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2293.84s)]
*  Anything they can do to encourage a drug addicted population there for. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2298.72s)]
*  Yeah. A hundred percent. It's disgusting. Gavin Newsom makes me sick. The money, like, you know, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2302.7999999999997s)]
*  he talks about this multifaceted plan to attack the opioid epidemic. It's like, yeah, you've spent [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2306.72s)]
*  billions of dollars and it's only gotten worse. Right. Encouraging people to be addicts. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2311.36s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. And so I got, so I decided for some dumb reason to bring my drugs to school with [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2315.6800000000003s)]
*  me that day. And, and I also did something that I would never normally do. I told some random [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2324.2400000000002s)]
*  person that I'd never met that I was high on heroin. Like in class, like someone I'd sat next [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2333.92s)]
*  to the first time seemed like a cool person, cool guy. Like, yeah, I'm on here. Yeah. And he's like, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2339.2s)]
*  oh really? And like, didn't seem like he was going to tell on me. And, and so I'm in, I remember like [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2343.9199999999996s)]
*  two periods later, I'm in class and some administrator comes into the room and says, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2352.8799999999997s)]
*  Chris, can you come to the office? And I saw a cop behind her and I was like, oh, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2359.7599999999998s)]
*  fuck. And so I go down to the office and she's like, yeah, we heard a rumor that you were doing [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2364.72s)]
*  drugs. And I'm like, who said that? She's like, well, I can't tell you. And I was like, well, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2374.16s)]
*  it's not true. You know, deny, deny, deny, deny. But they're like, she's like, okay, well, you know, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2380.4s)]
*  we're going to search you. And I was like, I don't think you guys have the, I don't think you guys [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2387.44s)]
*  have the legal right to search me. And she's like, if we have probable cause and like, you know, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2393.2s)]
*  basically I allowed it. I wasn't sure if it was legal or not, but I was hoping that. And so they [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2399.2s)]
*  searched me in pants, you know, belts, all that stuff. And she was about to turn away. And then [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2405.4399999999996s)]
*  she says, wait, let me check your socks. Literally like the last thing she did. And I was like, oh, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2411.9199999999996s)]
*  fuck. And so of course got caught, got arrested. So you had the kid in your socks. Yeah. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2417.2s)]
*  It's just like high socks with it just like right here. And so I get, you know, arrested or detained [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2423.6s)]
*  and my, you know, the cop releases me into my mom's custody. And my mom drives me home. She says, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2432.72s)]
*  you're, you're going to rehab. Like, you know, I don't want to hear anything about it. You're [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2440.24s)]
*  going to rehab. And I was like, okay. And your mom is like someone who knows opioids, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2445.7599999999998s)]
*  like how bad it is. Yes. Yes. And, and that's why she would, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2450.64s)]
*  you know, at times, you know, when it was like, I was in terrible withdrawal and I was like, mom, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2456.64s)]
*  I I'm dying. Like I need to like, please just give me like, you know, and you know, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2461.7599999999998s)]
*  she would occasionally give me a little bit of money just to, because she felt she knew, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2467.2s)]
*  she knew and God bless her, you know, she just, I put so I, you know, I rained down so much terror [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2471.7599999999998s)]
*  and chaos upon my parents. They just, they were just trying everything they could think of. And, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2479.6s)]
*  you know, some things they did really well. Some things, obviously, you know, again, being a parent [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2485.36s)]
*  is hard, especially a parent of a wild psychotic truck adding. Yeah. And, and, and, and dealing [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2488.88s)]
*  with, you know, obviously, you know, my sister's issues as well, you know, just goodness. But as [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2497.12s)]
*  soon as my mom turned her back, I stole the $80 she had in cash out of her wallet and drove to LA. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2503.84s)]
*  And obviously, oh, so the gangbanger that I left this out, the gangbanger that I was partying with, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2510.88s)]
*  and I really regret doing this because, you know, I consider him a friend, but I was desperate [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2519.6800000000003s)]
*  at the time. And so I was like, all right, I'm going to rob him. And you're going to [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=2524.7200000000003s)]

*  like Chris Jr. My initials. That's what I went by my nickname from like kindergarten through, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3054.6600000000003s)]

*  their, like the way they did the process of selling the dope where they would now you had to, so you [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3071.7s)]
*  had to meet up, then follow them down like this empty street or an alley or something like that, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3078.66s)]
*  then stand up against a chain link fence and get searched. And then you could get into the car and [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3084.02s)]
*  get your stuff. And they would ask every single person, do you know CJ? Do you know CJ from South [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3091.94s)]
*  Orange County? Do you know where he lives? And yeah, so for a very long while, and you know, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3097.62s)]

*  because my father represented him in the hit and run. And the, the, the, the, it took the DA, like [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3154.34s)]

*  a few times when I was like, kind of just on and off using and so it was like the withdrawal was [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3607.54s)]
*  like, yeah, I kind of felt it. But there were, yeah, probably about 10 times when I went through [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3615.54s)]
*  hardcore withdrawal. And yeah, every single time, I was like, I never want to feel this feeling again, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3620.7400000000002s)]
*  you know, and, but I wasn't, I still wasn't committing to myself that I wanted to stop. I [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3628.58s)]
*  was just like, how long does it last the withdrawal agony? I mean, it's they say like up to like seven [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3636.58s)]
*  days typically, but I mean, in reality, I mean, my withdrawal, I'm the my last withdrawal lasted [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3643.38s)]
*  about like three, it was like three weeks before I remember, I remember like the day I was like [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3652.34s)]
*  laying in bed, and I was like, wow, I actually feel comfortable. Like, my body doesn't ache, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3657.7s)]
*  like I can, I'm like, I feel, I feel kind of normal. Three weeks? Yeah, I mean, and it's like, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3662.66s)]
*  the first week is just like absolute hell. You're sweating bullets, you're cold, like the sweat on [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3669.06s)]
*  your body makes you cold. And then it's just, it's, it's terrible. And again, all the other things I [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3675.8599999999997s)]
*  described. And that just slowly and then and then the, the discomfort, it's like the epitome of [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3679.94s)]
*  discomfort, gastrointestinal to some people, some people got like diarrhea, things like that I did, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3687.38s)]
*  I didn't some people got like would vomit and stuff. But that never really happened to me. It's, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3693.46s)]
*  I guess it's just, you know, depends on the person. But yeah, it just, just overwhelming, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3699.1400000000003s)]

*  Interesting. So rehab, I mean, you're making a pretty strong case, it doesn't work very well. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3717.62s)]
*  I mean, if you went to 50, I mean, God knows what that cost, by the way, you know, someone paid for [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3723.3s)]
*  it. I don't know if it's your family or some insurance program, the state taxpayers, whatever, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3728.02s)]

*  with the military, you know, corner crease and everything like that, all your shirts had to be [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3750.1s)]
*  lined up your, you know, your toiletries had to be perfectly in a row, all that stuff. And, you know, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3755.2200000000003s)]

*  smoke marijuana and drink recreationally, occasionally. But yeah, I made the decision [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3790.02s)]
*  that I, or you know, I just wasn't ready to quit yet. And I think what, what it's really, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3799.7s)]
*  you can go to as many different treatment centers, doctors, AA meetings, it has to be, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3805.2999999999997s)]

*  self-respect, if no other. And teabagging, sorry to say it, teabagging is one of those. You shouldn't [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3837.62s)]
*  be doing that. And you know, you shouldn't be doing that. And yet the big nicotine pouch companies [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3842.34s)]
*  encourage you to teabag. They call them nicotine pouches, but they're basically teabags. They're [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3847.2999999999997s)]

*  not teabagging when you use it. And you should be proud of that. You've got self-respect. Now [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3862.5s)]
*  you can show that self-respect with our no teabagging t-shirt. It's wrong, but you're better than that. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3867.0600000000004s)]
*  Okay, so let me just ask you, I've heard and known, I've heard this story and I've known [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3875.2200000000003s)]
*  many people who've lived this story where they're addicted to something, whether it's pills or heroin [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3880.5800000000004s)]
*  cocaine, alcohol mostly, and they just go to rehab after rehab after rehab, relapse after relapse [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3885.54s)]
*  after relapse, destroying their sense of themselves. And they feel like losers, you know, when you keep [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3891.7s)]
*  failing at something, it's not good for you. You fail more. Yeah, exactly. So why do we have, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3897.7s)]
*  what's the point of this? Why do we have these centers clearly don't work? I mean, do they? I [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3902.5s)]
*  don't know. It doesn't sound like they do. Yeah, I mean, again, I think that it all depends on the [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3908.66s)]
*  person. But again, it has to, you have to want it. That's the bottom line is like, you have to [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3915.22s)]
*  want it. And like these treatment centers, they can't, they do some good, but they should not be [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3919.2999999999997s)]
*  like, you should not say, you know, rehab is a cure or AA is a cure because like, yeah, if you're [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3925.06s)]
*  go, if you go into those places, you can sometimes develop the intrinsic motivation through therapy [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3932.4199999999996s)]
*  or through discussion with other people or whatever. But I mean, for me, it was so fast forward a [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3938.34s)]
*  little bit. So, you know, I get basically kicked out of every rehab in California. So my parents [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3946.0200000000004s)]
*  are like, all right, let's send you to Florida. Let's try a new environment. And South Florida was [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3949.94s)]
*  like the rehab capital. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Delray Boynton Beach. And it was just, I mean, I [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3955.1400000000003s)]
*  was shocked that like some of the places where the halfway houses were are the [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3968.02s)]
*  sober homes were located like down the street from like the known markets where people like were, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3973.7000000000003s)]
*  you know, it's a scam. Look, no one's more for sobriety than I am. I'm a sober person, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3979.46s)]
*  totally opposed to drugs and alcohol, period. But let's just stop lying about it. This is a, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3984.6600000000003s)]
*  these places are a scam, not all of them. Yeah. But a lot of them are just a money making scam [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3990.58s)]
*  profiting off the misery and death of addicts. Yeah, they see you as an insurance policy with [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=3996.2599999999998s)]
*  a heartbeat. Exactly. That's pretty much it, you know, and true villains, I think. Yeah. No, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4001.46s)]
*  no, this most the most sinister man probably in if you want to just pick one out is his name is. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4006.82s)]
*  He was I that was the first treatment center I went to in Florida. So owned a treatment center. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4013.62s)]
*  And he owns several halfway houses. But they were all everything was in his wife's name. That's one [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4019.86s)]
*  thing that was like a red flag to me. And so and this guy shows up to the to the rehab center in [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4024.98s)]
*  like a three piece, you know, Armani suit with like a Gucci belt and like, you know, like dressed [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4030.42s)]
*  like a pimp, you know, I mean, and, and ironically, he is a pimp. He was so he had girls in his halfway [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4036.58s)]
*  houses that he was giving heroin giving crack and pimping them out. And then sending them back to [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4044.1s)]
*  treatment where they would ultimately fail their drug test and have to go to detox. And guess who [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4052.02s)]
*  gets a kickback from the detox center? No way. Yeah. And it was the South Florida rehab shuffle. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4057.3s)]
*  There are many cases of it. If you you know, just Google that you'll see, you know, a bunch of [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4064.18s)]
*  different stories. But as I would say is like the kingpin of just absolute scumbag, like you said, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4068.9s)]
*  villain, a true evil. That is so yeah, it's it's it's incomprehensible to me as a human. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4077.54s)]
*  It's like a slave trader. Yeah, yeah, essentially treating people as objects as animals. Yeah. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4083.06s)]
*  And so does he does he still in this business? I know he's he was sentenced to 27 years in prison. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4088.1s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. So the feds the feds started to crack down on the Florida rehab shuffle, although I read [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4094.42s)]
*  somewhere that it's supposedly coming back that the you know, because it's basically and you know, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4101.3s)]
*  it wasn't the he was probably one of the worst offenders. But a lot of these guys were you know, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4107.7s)]
*  they they would just like, you know, get these cheap homes, fill them with as many addicts as [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4112.58s)]
*  they could. Sometimes they would charge rent like 75 bucks a week or something like that, plus the [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4117.78s)]
*  money they're getting from, you know, kickbacks from the whichever treatment center they send [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4122.9800000000005s)]
*  them to. So they're housed, they send them and then and then if they go to detox, you know, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4127.46s)]
*  the kickback, it's a revolving door of chaos, and revolving door of suffering, and just pain [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4132.74s)]
*  for the addict. And and but they're making money at every stop. This is disgusting. It is. Do the [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4140.34s)]
*  addicts in the rehab center understand that they are pawns in profit making scheme? I think a lot [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4148.66s)]
*  of people were starting to wake up to it. And I and I knew one of the girls who was one of his [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4156.1s)]
*  victims. And she would she was always like, man, I just want to get the hell out of here. And she [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4161.860000000001s)]
*  had this like, look in her like, I could see that there was something. And I thought she was just [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4167.14s)]
*  very, like, you know, maybe had some some issues with her family or whatever, just a very depressed, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4171.9400000000005s)]
*  sad person, even for an addict, even for an addict, like I could tell that there was something like [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4176.660000000001s)]
*  she was in absolute like misery and terror. She was afraid of they were afraid of many people [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4181.38s)]
*  were afraid of him. And what he would do if they spoke out. And it was just it was heartbreaking [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4188.02s)]
*  for me to see that, you know, even as someone who's, you know, obviously committed crimes and [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4196.66s)]
*  things like that. I can't even imagine having the the will to carry out such a monstrous act [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4201.86s)]
*  is it's it's it tells you a lot. So I mean, that many rehabs, you met a lot of people. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4210.740000000001s)]
*  What did you learn about addicts? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4219.22s)]
*  Addicts are some of the most resourceful, intelligent people on the planet, like you drop [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4222.820000000001s)]
*  an addict in the middle of the desert, and they're going to find the nearest tribe with an opium pipe, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4228.740000000001s)]
*  you know, within 30 minutes. And so if you get their single minded, aren't they? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4235.54s)]
*  Well, yeah, but if you get them to if you can, you know, separate them from the drug and separate [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4242.1s)]
*  them from the addiction and turn that into something that's good, like, you know, an addiction to work [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4249.22s)]
*  or addiction to helping others, you know, that you can get addicted to. Like, I mean, for me, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4255.86s)]
*  the reason I got sober, I think there's several factors that played into it, obviously, God, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4261.46s)]
*  you know, and, and the intrinsic motivation, you know, that I talked about, and and having a [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4268.259999999999s)]
*  fantastic support system that was there for me, they were just waiting for me to [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4276.42s)]
*  come to them, you know, just like, hey, we're here, just, you know, family, yeah, my family, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4282.98s)]
*  yeah, my family, and, and one of the one halfway house owner who was kind of participating in this [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4288.74s)]
*  game, but he cared, like he cared, he genuinely cared about the people who were coming to his [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4296.9s)]
*  house, he did not allow any drug use or anything like that. There was I was at one place that was [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4300.98s)]
*  selling this this guy was selling crack to his clients at the halfway house. No way. Yes. And [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4306.66s)]

*  you know, tried 50 different rehab centers, but ended up, you know, getting sober to crack house. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4536.98s)]
*  But I think that that's yeah, it was smoking weed in the halfway house. Yeah, he didn't care about [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4544.18s)]
*  yeah, you could smoke anything you wanted in there pretty much. And yeah, I was just like that day, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4549.46s)]
*  I knew I was never going to touch an opiate again. And I know people say like, you have to wake up and [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4557.54s)]
*  make a decision every day that you're not going to use. But it's like, I don't even, it doesn't even [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4561.62s)]
*  like register in my mind, like, like to fit to say it, like, I'm not going to use heroin today, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4565.38s)]
*  because like, you know what I mean? You know what I'm saying? I do know what you're saying. Yeah, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4570.74s)]
*  it's like, because it's like, I look back and I'm like, that's, I'm a different person. I'm truly a [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4574.5s)]
*  different person. I have like evolved as like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, or, you know, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4579.3s)]
*  whatever analogy you want to use, but just and looking back and thinking, how could I have [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4584.98s)]
*  possibly done all this? And, and yeah, I mean, Christ plays a huge role. And I think it's really [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4591.379999999999s)]
*  important. And even for people who are, excuse me, you know, maybe atheistic or whatever, but [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4599.459999999999s)]
*  just believing in something greater than yourself that can, that, you know, you can strive to be [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4607.14s)]
*  better and strive to, you know, just whatever set goals for yourself and achieve them. And [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4615.14s)]
*  by doing that, you are, you know, I think that's how people can, can find a way out of addiction. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4621.860000000001s)]
*  And then, and then you grasp onto something, find things that you really enjoy. So like what I was [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4629.780000000001s)]
*  like, okay, what do I enjoy? I like, I love movies. I'm a huge movie fanatic. And I like, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4634.26s)]
*  I'm really interested in politics and journalism. And ironically, what I mean, I was always, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4639.06s)]
*  you know, my like Fox News was on my parents television 24 seven, you know, so I grew up [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4646.34s)]
*  conservative. My grandmother was a door knocker for, for Reagan and for [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4650.1s)]
*  Bush, someone else. I can't think. No, the, he was the first, the first conservative to run. He [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4658.26s)]
*  didn't win. Goldwater. Oh yeah. Goldwater. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Goldwater. Yeah. And so, yeah, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4664.900000000001s)]
*  politics kind of is in my DNA, I would say. And I remember watching Fox in the lead up to the [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4673.780000000001s)]
*  presidential election. It was like the perfect time to be, get interested in politics, right? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4679.860000000001s)]
*  You've got Trump and Hillary Clinton. And, and then I remember seeing you. And I was like, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4684.9800000000005s)]
*  and I'm not just saying this because I'm on your podcast. This is genuinely the truth. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4692.26s)]
*  I saw you on your show and I was like, I like, I love the way this guy does the news. It's, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4696.82s)]
*  it's different. It's unique. It's funny. It's like, I want to do something like that. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4703.38s)]
*  I want it. That's what I want to do. Like here's a Southern Californian [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4707.46s)]
*  who had addiction problems and he turned out okay. And you're like, Hey, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4710.98s)]
*  yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't, I didn't know all that about you. No, I was just like, I was just like, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4716.1s)]
*  wow, this guy is like so much different than the other voices on Fox. You know, I mean, not to, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4721.54s)]
*  I mean, you know, you just had, it brings such a unique perspective. You're willing to, you know, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4726.74s)]
*  go against, you know, quote unquote, the party and call out the, you know, the rhinos and the [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4734.5s)]
*  neocons and all that stuff. And I was just like, he's, he's awesome. Like this is great. And so [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4738.98s)]
*  let me ask you like a philosophical question. So in between jobs, once I got fired from another job, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4744.58s)]
*  I was an unpaid fellow at a libertarian think tank in DC and I thought it was a libertarian, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4751.379999999999s)]
*  sort of am libertarian in a lot of ways still, you know, I really don't want to bother other people, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4758.419999999999s)]
*  but I, I left after a drug policy conference that I went to that really kind of changed my [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4763.7s)]
*  thinking on the world and at it, they explained the libertarian position on drug policy, which [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4768.5s)]
*  is kind of America's position on drug policy, which is it's the drug addict's fault. Like [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4772.82s)]
*  people get addicted to drugs. That's their problem. That's their fault. And it's kind of the demand [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4777.86s)]
*  explanation for the drug epidemic. It's like, we have a lot of drugs because people want a lot of [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4783.62s)]
*  drugs in this country. It's not Mexico or China's fault or the drug dealers. Yeah, no, the, the, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4787.3s)]
*  yeah, the desire for it. Like, yeah. And, and that's what Mexico says. It's like, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4792.82s)]
*  if you people didn't want it so badly, you know, it's, it's very true. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4797.22s)]
*  That makes sense. I mean, it's kind of like one of those lines you hear, they're like, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4801.0599999999995s)]
*  yeah, that sounds right. And then you think of your own life and then you think of the people, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4803.94s)]
*  you know, who got, you know, tragically fucked up or killed by drugs. And of course I know a lot of [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4808.98s)]
*  them. And you think, no, actually, like some of them are like your mom, super healthy person, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4814.42s)]
*  obviously a distance runner, the healthiest person like in America, you know, they're distance runners [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4821.78s)]
*  and she has an injury and some doctor gives her a drug and she becomes an addict. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4826.82s)]
*  Yeah. And my dad literally one time he went into the office and he grabbed the guy by hit, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4831.22s)]
*  like threw him up against the wall. He's like, you're poisoning my fucking wife. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4836.1s)]
*  Good for your dad. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4839.22s)]
*  Yeah. And, and, um, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4840.18s)]
*  I should say your parents such a beautiful, you told me off camera are still married, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4841.46s)]
*  which is so. Yeah, married, married for four, married for 40 plus years. And, uh, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4844.82s)]
*  that's incredible. And, uh, yeah, they've, yeah, they're in love. I mean, they're a true, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4850.26s)]
*  jaded love story. That's the best part of this whole story. And the reason, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4855.3s)]
*  or just really quickly, the reason my dad fell in love with my mom, like at first sight was because [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4859.62s)]
*  he said she was the only woman in New York he saw that was wearing a crucifix like he'd, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4863.7s)]
*  that he'd seen in New York. So he's like, he's like, yeah, she's the one. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4867.860000000001s)]
*  They sound like great people. Great people. Oh, you would love, you would love my dad. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4872.02s)]
*  Oh, I can tell. I can tell. I'd like to throw a few doctors against the wall myself. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4875.06s)]
*  But okay. So then there's that. And then there's your story, which is like insecure high school [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4879.54s)]
*  kid. Like how many high school kids are not insecure? Right. Zero. Like the feelings that [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4884.82s)]
*  you described, like, I don't quite fit in. I don't know if I'm cool or not. Every single kid has that [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4889.219999999999s)]
*  feeling at 15. So you're not unique in that way. And someone's like, Hey, try this. And then you [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4893.78s)]
*  become like a crazed, you know, needle dependent heroin addict and you're pepper spraying members, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4899.54s)]
*  the Mexican mafia and almost getting killed. So like within a year. So that suggests to me that [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4905.62s)]
*  what we have as a supply problem, not a demand problem, like you're in it, you know, you probably [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4911.54s)]
*  would have been happy with Bud Light or Coors Light or whatever. And instead you wind up on heroin [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4915.78s)]
*  because you had access to this drug. So if you take a hundred people and give them heroin every [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4921.62s)]
*  day for a month, like what percentage become junkies? Like all of them. So it was, I was just [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4928.98s)]
*  thinking this at this drug policy conference and I was like, actually you're all liars, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4934.9s)]
*  probably getting paid by Purdue Pharma to lie. And it's the Cato Institute and they're definitely [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4939.9400000000005s)]
*  liars. I can say that now, but I didn't understand it until, because this is the one topic I knew [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4944.660000000001s)]
*  something about having lived it. But like, what is the answer to this problem that kills over a [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4949.620000000001s)]
*  hundred thousand people a year? Like from like a, from like a government perspective? Yeah, like [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4958.34s)]
*  what are we, it seems like we're paying addicts to use drugs. That's kind of my perspective. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4962.02s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think that one thing we should not be doing is what California is doing and trying [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4966.34s)]
*  to do set up like little, basically Porter pot, Porter potties for addicts to go in and, you know, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4972.58s)]
*  use and, you know, like little centers with clean needles and all that stuff. And again, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4977.7s)]
*  why would you encourage people to shoot heroin? Exactly. You don't coddle and enable drug addicts. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4983.46s)]
*  That is the worst thing you can do because they're just going to continue using. And heroin is not a [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4991.0599999999995s)]
*  drug that you can use. Like, and, and like, it's not like a, you know, cause there's a lot of [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=4997.0599999999995s)]
*  functional alcoholics and functional, you know, people who, you know, are on like, you know, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5002.98s)]
*  Valium or whatever, you know, they're kind of pill, pill poppers that, you know, you would never know. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5008.259999999999s)]
*  But yeah, heroin, I just, I've never seen anyone who doesn't, it doesn't become a lifestyle. It's [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5013.94s)]
*  not like a side thing, you know, or hobby or whatever. It is your life. It is all consuming. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5020.42s)]
*  What destroys you as a human being? Yeah. And same with meth. Oh yeah. Yeah. Meth, like inside and [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5027.38s)]
*  out too. Heroin doesn't quite like do the damage to your, like your complexion. Outwardly. Yeah, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5034.660000000001s)]
*  outwardly, but like inwardly, I think it's worse. But, but meth is yeah, absolutely terrible. Were [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5040.9800000000005s)]
*  you around a lot of meth people? Oh yeah. And so in Northern California, cause we moved to Northern [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5046.34s)]
*  California after, when I was, when I was 18, I remember my dad came down to San Diego, cause I [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5053.38s)]
*  was in rehab in San Diego and he picked me up and we drove north to the Bay Area, to the East Bay. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5060.42s)]
*  We lived in Concord. Yeah. And cause my grandmother lived in Lafayette. Yep. I know it. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5069.3s)]
*  And she was, those were nice towns. I don't know if they still are, but they were. Well, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5076.42s)]
*  Concord has been kind of been taken over by, there's a lot of gang activity. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5080.9800000000005s)]
*  And like, like, and it borders Clayton too. So they're like, I think they're probably going to [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5086.02s)]
*  do something about it cause Clayton's like a really nice area. So they're probably going to [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5089.78s)]
*  start cracking down more because, you know, the rich people are being affected. So now it's a [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5092.58s)]
*  problem. You know? And so yeah, so we moved up there and again, I started associating with [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5096.42s)]
*  the worst of the worst, the gang banging meth heads. And I'd never tried meth before. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5105.54s)]
*  And I remember I was just at this guy's house and he pulls out a pipe. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5111.7s)]
*  Like, all right, yeah, try it. See what the, see what the fuss is about. And I, I like, I, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5116.0199999999995s)]
*  So you're an open-minded young man. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5123.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So, you know, I, I didn't necessarily love it. It wasn't this like, oh yeah, I need this. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5126.82s)]
*  But like my, became my best friend was a dealer. So he always had it. So it's like, I would always [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5134.5s)]
*  just, yeah, take it like a puff or two. There was one point where I stayed up for 12 days straight [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5142.66s)]
*  and then slept for eight hours and stayed up for another sort of total of 17 days. So yeah, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5148.58s)]
*  another five days. And because doing heroin and meth, it's like, like meth when you're like, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5154.34s)]
*  basically like, you know, you're up for a day or two, you start to get weird, seeing shadow people [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5163.14s)]
*  and shit like that. Then you do heroin and it's like, it's like resets you almost. It's kind of [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5167.9400000000005s)]
*  like, it's like, you, it's like almost like you slept a little bit and your brain's like back to [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5173.860000000001s)]
*  normal and it's not going into crazy mode. I've seen meth heads, like, I remember this one story. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5179.22s)]
*  So I was, we were at this girl's house in her garage and it was myself, our dealer and this [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5186.1s)]
*  chick. And she had, you know, just all over her face, scrapped from scratching. She looked like, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5194.900000000001s)]
*  it's terrifying. I'd been kicked out of my house. So we were just chilling there. You know, we're [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5201.9400000000005s)]
*  just going, you know, from place to place trying to, you know, find a spot to, you know, kick it [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5207.620000000001s)]
*  and rest or whatever. And so we're smoking in there for like three, four hours and her and my [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5212.66s)]
*  friend go into the bathroom or inside her house. And I just kind of like sit back and I ended up [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5219.22s)]
*  like falling asleep and I didn't realize, I was like, I woke up and I was like, I had no idea how [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5226.66s)]
*  long I'd been asleep, like 30 seconds, 30 minutes, whatever. And there was no one in the garage. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5230.98s)]
*  So I like knock on the garage and I knocked the garage door, kind of peeked my head in. I'm like, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5236.0199999999995s)]
*  hey, what are you guys doing? And she comes out, she's like, close the door. I'm like, okay. And [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5241.78s)]
*  then she comes out and she's like, what the, what are you doing in my, in my house? My kids are in [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5248.099999999999s)]
*  there. And I'm like, oh my God, you have kids? And she's like, yeah, what, what'd you steal? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5253.0599999999995s)]
*  What did you steal? And I'm like, I didn't steal anything. And then she pulls out a handgun. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5259.3s)]
*  Yeah. And like, it's this switch that flips for some people. It's never happened to me, but this [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5264.42s)]
*  flip that switches and you, they just become in a totally different, irrational, dangerous human [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5270.1s)]
*  being. And so, so this woman has a gun pointed at me and she's like, I want, she's like empty your [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5276.660000000001s)]
*  pockets, blah, blah, blah. And I, I went like this and pulled out, like, you know, I was like, look, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5283.38s)]
*  I didn't steal anything from you. What would I steal? I poked my head into your place for two [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5287.700000000001s)]
*  seconds. And I'm like, by the way, if you have your kids sleeping in there, you're kind of a shitty [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5292.1s)]
*  mom. You know, I was, cause I'm like- [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5296.58s)]
*  So you insult the lady with the gun pointed at you. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5298.5s)]
*  Yes, because I was thinking- [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5300.9s)]
*  Another, if I can just ask you to pause, Chris, another unwise decision. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5302.02s)]
*  Yes, yes. But I was thinking, I was like, this woman isn't going to pull the trigger. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5305.54s)]
*  It was a neighborhood that the houses were like right next to each other. The police station was [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5309.86s)]
*  like down the street. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5313.86s)]
*  So you're betting that the meth head is rational? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5315.22s)]
*  I don't know what I was thinking. I was just angry and I was high too. So, you know, I'm not exactly [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5318.26s)]
*  in the best, you know, decision-making frame of mind, but anyways, so she's like, take your fucking [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5322.9s)]
*  clothes off. I want to make sure you didn't steal anything. I'm like, fuck you. Sorry. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5330.66s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, please. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5334.339999999999s)]
*  Fuck you. You're out of your fucking mind. I was like, I didn't steal a fucking thing from you. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5336.42s)]
*  I was like, you're not going to shoot me. So how about you just let us fucking leave? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5342.339999999999s)]
*  And so, and I'm like, and I'm looking at my friend and I'm like, dude, and he's just standing there. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5345.94s)]
*  Like this guy was a piece of work. So that night, so she's like, all right, get the fuck out of here. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5354.42s)]
*  And she opens her garage up for us and we leave and my friend calls an Uber and the Uber, like the, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5361.139999999999s)]
*  her phone died in the middle of the ride. And so like the trip got canceled. And so the woman [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5369.7s)]
*  who was driving us was like, get out, get out of my car right now. And we were like, still like a [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5375.94s)]
*  couple miles from our destination, his sister's house. And he, and I was like, shit. And he's [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5382.82s)]
*  like, oh, don't worry. I have a spot we can go to. And I'm like, okay. And so we walk up the street [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5389.7s)]
*  and there's his house. And he's like, yeah, I forget who he said owned it. But he's like, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5395.22s)]
*  yeah, it's cool if we crash here. And he tries to open the front door. It's not locked. He's like, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5403.54s)]
*  all right, let me go around the back. And he's like, rummaging around, he's rummaging around in [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5407.06s)]
*  the backyard. And I'm standing in the front, just sitting on the steps because I didn't think there [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5411.3s)]
*  was anything sketchy. And this car drives by and it kind of slows down. And, and then it [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5415.62s)]
*  keeps going. And I'm like, huh, that was weird. And then it loops back and then stops. And I was [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5424.26s)]
*  like, oh shit. So I had a backpack with me. I grabbed my backpack, hopped the fence into [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5430.9800000000005s)]
*  the backyard. And I was like, Hey, dude, someone's here. And he takes off. And I'm running and I, [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5435.780000000001s)]
*  it's like, it's four, it's like four in the morning in Northern California in the winter. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5444.5s)]
*  And I'm running and it's pitch black and I fall into a pool. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5449.700000000001s)]
*  This is like one of the worst nights of my life. And I was in a low key opiate withdrawal too, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5455.62s)]
*  on top of all of that. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5460.660000000001s)]
*  On top of the meth and the crazy girl pointing the gun at you. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5462.1s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And that's why I was so irritable. And probably if I, yeah, if I had been, you know, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5464.9800000000005s)]
*  if I was on heroin, it probably would have gone down a lot differently, but I probably wouldn't [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5469.860000000001s)]
*  have been as aggressive, but I was so ticked off. And so I fall in the pool. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5473.62s)]
*  I see flashlights like coming towards us and this guy has already booked it like over a fence. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5482.74s)]
*  And he's gone. Like he is gone. And so I like, I get out of the pool and I try to climb the [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5490.74s)]
*  fence and I still have my backpack on and you know, it was like soaking wet and I couldn't [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5499.86s)]
*  climb. It was too heavy. So I had to shed the backpack and just hop the fence. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5503.78s)]
*  And I'm running down this hill and I run face first into a chain link fence. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5507.78s)]
*  It's like a dream sequence. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5516.74s)]
*  And my face is like, you know, so now my face is bleeding and my hands are bleeding from [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5519.38s)]
*  climbing the fence. And like, and I don't have any shoes on. And so I am just so cold and so [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5524.66s)]
*  miserable. And so I, there was like a hill and then there was a grocery store, kind of a little [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5533.86s)]
*  strip mall type place. And so I go down there and I look for the sketchiest person possible. Like, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5539.62s)]
*  you know, just, you can tell. Yeah. Yeah. They're using my radar and, and I was like, hey, man, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5548.42s)]
*  can I use your phone to call a taxi? Cause I knew if I asked any normal person, they saw me with [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5554.02s)]
*  blood on my face and no shoes on, they'd be like, ah, get the fuck away from me, sir, please. But [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5557.860000000001s)]
*  no, they were, they were really nice. They let me use their phone and I called a taxi, jumped into [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5564.9800000000005s)]
*  the taxi. I was like, please turn the heat up as high as you can. And I went home and [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5573.22s)]
*  at first my parents weren't going to let me in. And I was like, listen, I'm, I'm probably going to [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5578.34s)]
*  get hypothermia if you don't let me in, please. I was like, I will do whatever you want. I will [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5585.860000000001s)]
*  go anywhere. I just please. I, and I remember like going into their room and just like wrapping [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5589.3s)]
*  myself up in a, in a giant blanket. And, and I was, there was like, I'd never felt so relieved [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5594.34s)]
*  in my life. Did you ever figure out who was chasing you? I think it was someone who, like [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5601.22s)]
*  because the house, it turns out the house was for rent and it was, it was, there was no one in it. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5608.18s)]
*  And so I didn't know, of course I didn't know that he said, yeah, this is a spot that we can go to. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5615.860000000001s)]
*  I just assumed it was another dope fiend's, another dope fiend's place. And so yeah, all that. And, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5620.900000000001s)]
*  you know, one thing that really breaks my heart is like, it's really the, yeah, one of the most, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5630.34s)]
*  I'd say difficult things that I had to accept that I did was, because my dad would from time [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5637.7s)]
*  to time figure out where I was and go to these, you know, these crack houses and, and places like [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5644.66s)]
*  that and begged me to come home. And I remember one time specifically, he said, please, please Chris, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5651.7s)]
*  please come home. Like your family loves you, please. In tears and, and my dad doesn't cry. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5659.3s)]
*  And, and I was just like, no. And he's like, okay, well at least take, and he gave me his, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5668.5s)]
*  his crucifix and St. Christopher medal. I still have, I broke the chain, but I still have them [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5675.54s)]
*  today to this day. And gosh, even then it tore me up, you know, because I, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5682.179999999999s)]
*  I just wasn't ready to stop. And I didn't know, like, you know, I didn't want to cause this pain [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5691.54s)]
*  that, you know, and suffering that my parents were feeling. And so I drowned it out with just [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5696.74s)]
*  more use and, you know, to, to try to, you can see how that happens. Yeah. So when you quit [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5702.0199999999995s)]
*  2016, how long did it take to get back your equilibrium for your brain to start [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5711.7s)]
*  functioning as it had before you started using opioids? Honestly, I don't know that it will, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5718.42s)]
*  it has ever gotten back to where it was before, but I think that it took about, I would say like [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5725.7s)]
*  nine months to a year to like, get like the fall, like to get the fog out and like, you know, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5734.02s)]
*  have like, cause like my memory was shot, just everything was like depleted. And so in order to [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5740.18s)]
*  get, you know, to get those receptors and everything firing again, to get my brain back to where it [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5747.14s)]
*  needed to be. Yeah. I just, it was hard. What are the long-term longer-term effects? I would say, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5752.74s)]
*  I'd say memory loss is definitely a thing. Equilibrium, like I have a very bad equilibrium, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5761.139999999999s)]
*  like people think I'm drunk sometimes because I'll like stumble, but it's just like, no, I'm just, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5766.66s)]
*  yeah, my equilibrium is off. And I mean, obviously, you know, long-term like things like anxiety, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5772.42s)]
*  you know, it's ironic because a lot of people use heroin to treat their anxiety. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5779.46s)]
*  But it causes, you know, again, it's the rebound effect. And so yeah, anxiety, depression, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5785.62s)]
*  just, yeah, a myriad of bad things. I have known, you know, people addicted to opioids and have [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5795.14s)]
*  heard that it affects your ability to feel happiness once you're off it. Yeah, I would say that, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5801.22s)]
*  yeah, I didn't, I always, and I, you know, and even to this day, like, have this kind of sense [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5808.18s)]
*  sometimes of like imposter syndrome. Like, I like, you know, you know, for example, like getting a [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5814.34s)]

*  these nice things about me. It's like, I don't feel like I deserve this praise. You know, I mean, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5826.26s)]
*  sure, I'm a like, I'm a decent person. But yeah, it's like, it took me a while to just [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5833.9400000000005s)]
*  understand that like, yeah, I am worthy of these. I have achieved a lot. I have been, you know, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5840.900000000001s)]
*  sure, I've done a lot of bad things, but I've done everything I can to try to, you know, repair the [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5846.42s)]
*  damage that I caused. And so, like, so no, I deserve, you know, it's just, it's hard to [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5851.7s)]
*  force yourself to, you know, accept like, yeah, you're like, you're doing well, like just be, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5857.62s)]
*  yes, you were, you were as bad as it could get, but you've turned it around. And like, you know, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5863.06s)]
*  I was, I was kind of nervous about this interview, but then I was like, and I was talking to my dad [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5870.18s)]
*  and he's like, Chris, you stopped using heroin. You can do an interview. Yeah. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5874.02s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, yeah, you know, it was, and again, like, I go back to the intrinsic motivation. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5879.860000000001s)]
*  It's just so important to want to level up in life. And I think that like, you know, I kind of [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5889.9400000000005s)]
*  compare it to like the whole body positivity movement. It's like, yeah, you're 40 pounds, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5894.9800000000005s)]
*  and I'm not talking about people with like medical issues, but like you're 40 pounds overweight. No, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5898.9800000000005s)]
*  you're perfect. Just the way you are. It's like, no, put the donut down, go to the gym, like, [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5903.9400000000005s)]
*  you know, stop, stop coddling people who are, you know, who have a food addiction, encouraging [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5907.86s)]
*  people to destroy themselves. That's the way I think about it. Right. Only, only people who are [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5913.219999999999s)]
*  filled with hate would do that. I don't care what they dress it up as. If you're encouraging someone [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5920.099999999999s)]
*  to hurt himself, you hate that person. Right. Yeah. I mean, it seems so. Well, obviously, yeah. If [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5924.0199999999995s)]
*  you did that to your kids here, get type two diabetes here, become a junkie, you would be [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5931.62s)]
*  a terrible parent, but you would be acting of hate for your kids. Obviously. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5937.06s)]
*  Sinister. It's, it is sinister. And, you know, that's why, you know, like, you know, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5940.660000000001s)]
*  you see all these like Victoria's Secret plus size, you know, it's like, and again, you shouldn't, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5945.54s)]
*  you shouldn't do, you shouldn't want to better yourself, you know, for societal acceptance, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5950.18s)]
*  but for your own sense of, you know, happiness and wellbeing and purpose, because you talk to [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5954.820000000001s)]
*  any person who's overweight, you know, and like, again, without medical conditions, like, obviously, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5960.26s)]
*  they're going to say, yes, I would prefer to be prefer to lose a few pounds. I mean, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5965.62s)]
*  I would assume I've never talked to every obese. I haven't talked to every obese person on the [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5969.62s)]
*  planet, but the ones that I have talked to, yeah, I would like they're tormented by it. Of course, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5973.62s)]
*  they're tormented. You don't feel good. And, and, and, and, and yeah, and like Victoria's Secret [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5978.34s)]
*  and these other places trying to tell them, oh, yeah, you're perfectly fine. Keep doing what [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5984.34s)]
*  you're doing. Don't change anything. No, it's evil. Obviously, let's just call it what it is. Yeah. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5988.099999999999s)]
*  All these things are there. Big Pharma. Yeah, I think. Abetting the destruction of human beings. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5993.46s)]
*  And that's, that's the worst thing you can do in this life, in my opinion. Absolutely. Big Pharma [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=5997.86s)]
*  is the closest thing to like, you know, like, if you just want to talk about pure evil, like getting [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6003.22s)]
*  into the realm of demonically sick. Big Pharma is, I think, the prime example, what they've done to [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6008.66s)]
*  this country. I couldn't agree more. Chris, thank you for spending all this time and for being so [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6015.62s)]
*  totally honest about your story. And I never say I hope this helps people because it feels like [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6019.7s)]
*  so banal, but I do hope this helps people. Thank you. I appreciate it, Tucker. Thank you. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6024.9s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising. That's [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6033.54s)]
*  what they do. But on another level, it's shocking. With everything that's going on in the world right [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6038.66s)]
*  now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics, with the wars, one the cusp [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6042.66s)]
*  of fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information rather than more. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6047.86s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6053.78s)]
*  That's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it, a way [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6060.099999999999s)]
*  that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. The way to do [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6064.0199999999995s)]
*  that on YouTube, we think it's to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe, hit the little bell icon to be [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6069.46s)]
*  notified when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6074.82s)]
*  actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWz3TWaLO1I&t=6080.82s)]
