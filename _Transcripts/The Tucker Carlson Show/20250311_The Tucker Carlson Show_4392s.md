Video Description: The Mexican drug cartels are a far greater threat to the United States than China, Russia or Iran, says Doug Macgregor. They’ve got Javelin missile systems on our border, and American officials on their payroll.

# Col. Doug Macgregor: Mexican Cartels’ Advanced Weaponry, and Why They’re a Bigger Threat Than Russia
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE)
*  It feels like we're on the brink of something really catastrophic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=0.0s)]
*  I kind of can't shake that feeling. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=8.3s)]
*  And by catastrophic, I mean some kind of global war. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=11.1s)]
*  Hope that's not true. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  But let's just start with what just happened, which is a drone attack on Moscow by the Ukrainians [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  that killed a number of Russians in Moscow. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=21.8s)]
*  Who did that, why, and what are its effects? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=28.02s)]
*  Well, that's an important question. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  I think the Russians are disappointed in us because they detect that we're sincere in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=56.66s)]
*  terms of wanting to end this conflict. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=62.26s)]
*  Trump is sincere. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=64.94s)]
*  I mean, that's true. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=65.94s)]
*  But they don't understand why he does not act to remove this regime, remove this man [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=66.94s)]
*  Zelensky and put a stop to it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=71.62s)]
*  There's this constant drumbeat about a ceasefire. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=74.02s)]
*  Well, the Russians are highly organized and disciplined that they can stop whenever it [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=76.17999999999999s)]
*  makes sense to do so. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=82.17999999999999s)]
*  The Ukrainians are not in the same category. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=83.78s)]
*  They seem to be a rogue organization now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=86.22s)]
*  We've got 200,000 of them here in the United States, and I don't know how many thousands [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=88.62s)]
*  of them are working for the SBU, the Ukrainian secret police, that are now running around [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=93.9s)]
*  threatening everyone that has criticized Ukraine or opposed support for Ukraine. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=99.18s)]
*  And Alex Jones Stafford was just murdered two days ago, who was on some list put together [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=105.78s)]
*  by the Ukrainian government or supporters of critics. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=111.44s)]
*  He was murdered outside of his house. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=113.78s)]
*  I mean, I don't think it's crazy to think given the number of assassinations they've [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  pulled off or attempted that he was killed by them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=118.5s)]
*  You think that's possible? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  Well, I would be very worried about our president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  I think the president is very much at risk and these people seem to know no sense of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=125.06s)]
*  limitation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=130.26s)]
*  They're capable of anything. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=131.26s)]
*  So I hope the Secret Service is on its toes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=133.34s)]
*  I'm sure Kash Patel is well aware of this and the FBI. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=136.06s)]
*  I just don't have any good feelings right now about the Ukrainians. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=139.94s)]
*  I think they're done. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=143.06s)]
*  They're finished. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=144.46s)]
*  They've lost the war. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=145.46s)]
*  So all of these are sort of acts of vengeance, if you will, last resort. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=146.86s)]
*  Hurl whatever you have as deep as you can into Russia and just kill, murder, maim as [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=154.74s)]
*  many Russians as possible. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=159.62s)]
*  But to what end? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=161.58s)]
*  Well, to harm Russians and then try to create the illusion that there is some hope for them, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=162.58s)]
*  mobilize more manpower and put more forces into the field. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=169.5s)]
*  They can't. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=173.86s)]
*  They're really scraping the bottom of the barrel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=175.82s)]
*  I think the issue right now is the following. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=178.78s)]
*  The Russians have the initiative, strategic initiative. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=182.42s)]
*  This war is effectively at an end as far as they're concerned in terms of having won it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=185.34s)]
*  They now have to make some decisions. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=190.7s)]
*  So you have to put yourself not so much in the place of Zelensky. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=193.78s)]
*  He's irrelevant. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=197.46s)]
*  The Russians are not surprised by what he's done. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=198.78s)]
*  I think they're surprised that we haven't intervened to try and stop it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=201.38s)]
*  That's what I think they're surprised about. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=205.38s)]
*  So what they want now, the Russians, is an end to this nonsense. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  They have several options. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=211.94s)]
*  They now have concentrations of forces in the northeastern part of Ukraine and down [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=213.34s)]
*  in the southeastern part. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=218.88s)]
*  They can move at will at any time. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=221.18s)]
*  They have enough force they can cross and have some. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=222.94s)]
*  They can take Odessa. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=225.84s)]
*  They can move forward and straight into Kiev. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=227.84s)]
*  Whatever they do, they have to ask themselves, how far do we want to go to guarantee our [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  security as Russians? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=237.02s)]
*  And they have never really wanted to go very far. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=239.28s)]
*  That's never been the intent. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=242.72s)]
*  But over time, they've been pushed more and more and more to secure more territory to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  protect themselves. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=249.36s)]
*  This latest act is probably convincing Russians that they should go straight to the Dnieper [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=251.34s)]
*  River, cross into Kiev, root out this regime, root in branch, cross down south and take [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=256.3s)]
*  Odessa and turn rump Ukraine into a landlocked country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=262.74s)]
*  I'm sure there are people who are arguing for that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  There are other Russians who are saying, the hell with this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=269.14s)]
*  Let's just crush Ukraine once and for all. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=272.74s)]
*  This is a permanent cancer. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=275.66s)]
*  It's not going to go away. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=277.42s)]
*  People from the West are always going to try and go in and incite them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=279.4s)]
*  So let's march to the Romanian and Polish borders, right to Moldova and be done with [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=283.0s)]
*  this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=288.0s)]
*  In the middle of this, it's President Putin. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=289.12s)]
*  And President Putin is nothing if not a very judicious person. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  He's a very thoughtful person. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=295.94s)]
*  This is someone who does not act impulsively. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm sure you saw that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  I have. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=301.84s)]
*  Everything is calculated. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  So he's going to sit there and say, what do I want to do? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=304.67999999999995s)]
*  What makes the most sense for Russia? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=307.56s)]
*  Set aside the emotion. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=309.6s)]
*  And he also knows President Trump. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=311.48s)]
*  And he says, President Trump wants an end to this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=313.52s)]
*  So do I. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=316.08s)]
*  How do I nudge President Trump and say, help us? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=317.36s)]
*  We want to end this just as much as you do. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=321.68s)]
*  Help us a little bit. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=323.8s)]
*  Can't you rid us of this Manzelensky and this little MI6 CIA supported cabal that surrounds [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=325.28s)]
*  him? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=333.8s)]
*  Can't you help us with this? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=334.8s)]
*  But on the other hand, he's looking at his people and they're saying, don't depend on [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=336.04s)]
*  anything the West promises. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  Don't believe anything the West says. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  So march to the Dnieper, cross the river, end this once and for all. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=344.56s)]
*  This is the decision point. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=349.44s)]
*  It's a strategic inflection point in the history of Europe. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  Because you now have a Russian leader with the power, with the capability to do anything [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=354.3s)]
*  he wants. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=358.48s)]
*  But this is a Russian who doesn't want to march west. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=360.04s)]
*  He doesn't want to rule Ukrainians. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=363.38s)]
*  He's not a fool. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=365.8s)]
*  He knows those people don't want to be ruled by Russians. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=366.8s)]
*  So it's a difficult position, but he has to end it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=369.56s)]
*  And there's the other dangers. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=372.88s)]
*  Who knows what comes next? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=374.08s)]
*  They killed this Russian general who had a very prominent role and his name escapes me [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=377.2s)]
*  right now, but he was killed recently. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=383.0s)]
*  He had a very prominent role in identifying the attempts by the Ukrainians to build a [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=385.24s)]
*  dirty bomb and also to launch attacks on the nuclear power plants. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=388.74s)]
*  He knows there are people over there capable of that kind of lunacy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=395.2s)]
*  So that also has to figure into his calculus. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=399.08s)]
*  It's got to be one of the most evil governments in the world. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=402.02s)]
*  It is. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=405.8s)]
*  Well, look at what they've done to their own people. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=406.8s)]
*  I mean, how many of these Ukrainians have died needlessly? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=408.44s)]
*  The handwriting was on the wall two years ago. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=412.2s)]
*  Why would you drag this thing out? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=414.88s)]
*  And Putin has not wanted to drag it out, but he has also not wanted to give people in the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  impression that he's interested in doing anything more than removing the Ukrainian [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=423.8s)]
*  menace. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  In other words, he's not interested in conquest, doesn't want to march west. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, how many times can he and Lavrov say this nonsense and shut up Ann Applebaum and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=432.56s)]
*  the rest of these crazies? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  Why does Ann Applebaum have any effect on anything? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=440.04s)]
*  I mean, this is like one of the dumbest people in the United States. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=445.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, she's also married to the Polish foreign minister. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=446.76000000000005s)]
*  And right now, the latest poll says that 86% of the Polish population opposes any Polish [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=450.2s)]
*  participation in a war against Russia. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=456.64s)]
*  So and even Tusk has said, if you think we're joining some sort of contingent to go into [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  Western Ukraine, forget it, we're not going. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=464.26s)]
*  So I think this whole facade is crumbling. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=467.56s)]
*  Is there any European population, so there are many European leaders who have suggested, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=470.2s)]
*  some have said out loud, others have hinted that they're going to send troops to fight [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=474.24s)]
*  Putin. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=477.56s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=478.56s)]
*  Is there any European population that wants that? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=479.92s)]
*  No, not a chance. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=482.52s)]
*  I mean, the British are probably the furthest from Russia, and they all know what their [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=483.92s)]
*  army consists of today. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=492.12s)]
*  It's a bad facsimile of what was there 200 years ago. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=495.08s)]
*  It goes back to Bismarck's famous remark in 1879. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=498.52s)]
*  He was asked by a British journalist, what would you do if the British army landed on [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=503.88s)]
*  the North German coast? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=508.24s)]
*  He said, well, I'd have it arrested. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=509.76s)]
*  Everyone was upset, but he was right. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=514.0s)]
*  The British army was about the size that it is now. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=516.2s)]
*  And the German army at that point numbered what, four, 600,000 with a capacity to mobilize [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=519.36s)]
*  millions. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=525.04s)]
*  So this is all nonsense. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=526.04s)]
*  The same thing is nonsensical in France. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=527.04s)]
*  All my friends in the French military, and I've got several, have told me, Douglas, this [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=529.64s)]
*  is absurd. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=532.88s)]
*  The only thing the French army is prepared for is to go on safari in Africa. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=534.88s)]
*  Yeah, and they're pulling out of there. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=538.52s)]
*  And of course they're pulling out. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=540.36s)]
*  This is a waste of time, money, and resources, all of it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=541.56s)]
*  The issue for Donald Trump is as follows, and I think this is what's most important [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=545.2s)]
*  for him to keep in mind. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=549.72s)]
*  His instincts are good. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=551.64s)]
*  If he follows his instincts, he'll be fine. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=552.76s)]
*  He needs to stop listening to the people around him. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=555.0s)]
*  Number one, any war that breaks out today involving the United States and Russia, and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=557.4s)]
*  whether or not Russia, we want it to be involved, Russia is involved in the Middle East. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=563.5999999999999s)]
*  Russia is involved in Eastern Europe. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=569.0s)]
*  Whatever happens, the war will expand. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  We will end up with multiple enemies arrayed against us. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=574.2399999999999s)]
*  China, BRICS in general, and certainly Iran and other states in the Middle East. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=578.1199999999999s)]
*  So the first thing is all wars will expand. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  So don't start one under any circumstances. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=587.76s)]
*  It will expand out of control. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=590.2399999999999s)]
*  The second thing is he's going to discover the hard way that we are grossly overstretched [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  and overextended. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=598.1999999999999s)]
*  The American military establishment is in no position to fight any kind of long war. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=599.72s)]
*  Remember we used to talk about the long war that we were supposed to fight? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=605.0s)]
*  That was all nonsense. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=609.0799999999999s)]
*  If you look at all of the simulations that involve us against Iran or us against any [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=610.92s)]
*  number of great powers, they all end in two weeks. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=615.8s)]
*  Well, why does the war end in two weeks? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=620.4s)]
*  Because in two weeks we've exhausted everything that we've got. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=623.7199999999999s)]
*  There's no more ammunition. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=627.16s)]
*  There are no more missiles, no more rockets. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=628.16s)]
*  I would say in truth right now it's closer to one week, maybe 10 days. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=630.04s)]
*  And we don't have this scientific industrial base with manufacturing capability that is [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=635.88s)]
*  humming along 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=641.04s)]
*  We can't match Russia, the nation of what, 140 million? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  In that economic base producing in China. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=648.48s)]
*  China is in a position today that we were in during World War II and in the aftermath. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=652.64s)]
*  We were the productivity giant across the world. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=657.2s)]
*  That's China. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=661.4s)]
*  So you can't go to war with these people. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=662.4s)]
*  You'll be buried by them with conventional weapons and ammunition. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=664.04s)]
*  And anyone who thinks a nuclear exchange makes sense deserves to be shipped off to the nearest [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=668.2s)]
*  asylum and I think Trump understands that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=675.24s)]
*  So those first two things. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=677.6s)]
*  Anything that we do expands out of control. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=680.32s)]
*  Secondly, we're overstretched, overextended. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=682.5600000000001s)]
*  Our forces are tired. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=685.88s)]
*  They're very exhausted. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=686.88s)]
*  The naval forces in particular have a lot of problems. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=688.08s)]
*  Not just them, but they're the ones that are sitting out there on the front line right [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=692.16s)]
*  now. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=696.2s)]
*  And then on top of that you have the Air Force. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=697.24s)]
*  And the Air Force cannot field thousands and thousands of fighters and bombers. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=699.88s)]
*  We lost 18,000 bombers trying to penetrate German air defenses during World War II. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=704.84s)]
*  We and the Royal Air Force. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=710.64s)]
*  18,000 bombers. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=712.72s)]
*  Air defenses today in Iran are substantial and they are capable. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  This is the S-400. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=720.58s)]
*  They are layered with multiple kinds of missiles over a vast area and radars. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=722.12s)]
*  We are going to lose aircraft. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=727.26s)]
*  No one knows how many because we've never fought our way through it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=729.1800000000001s)]
*  We don't have thousands to lose. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=733.72s)]
*  So in an attrition setting, we can't win. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=736.24s)]
*  And unfortunately when you're 6,000 miles away from home, it's attrition. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=740.2s)]
*  You can't replace rapidly. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=745.08s)]
*  You can't reload rapidly. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=746.44s)]
*  You can't resupply rapidly, logistically as a disaster. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=748.32s)]
*  Then finally, you see what's happened in the market recently. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=751.88s)]
*  Dropped 900 points. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=755.28s)]
*  What do you think happens if there's a war in the Middle East or in Eastern Europe? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=756.28s)]
*  It'll just intensify the sell-off. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=761.88s)]
*  Everything tanks. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=764.28s)]
*  All confidence will be lost. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=765.64s)]
*  No one in their right mind at this point should be talking about a war. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=768.48s)]
*  We should be talking about disengagement. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=772.32s)]
*  And Zelensky, frankly, the way he was treated, I think President Trump was far too gentle. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=775.92s)]
*  I'm surprised that two giant Secret Service agents did not come in, pick him up and remove [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=781.64s)]
*  him from the office. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=787.48s)]
*  But the way he handled Zelensky is the way he's got to handle Netanyahu. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=790.2800000000001s)]
*  Because if he doesn't, Netanyahu will drag him into the abyss. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=794.44s)]
*  Because he wants this war in the Middle East come hell or high water. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=799.0400000000001s)]
*  And it's not in their interest. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=803.2s)]
*  What war? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=805.2s)]
*  The war with Iran, the war with everybody. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=806.4s)]
*  I mean, you've seen these settings where Netanyahu sits at a table and he's got everybody around [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=808.84s)]
*  him in his cabinet. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=814.36s)]
*  And he says, this is our opportunity to settle with everyone. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  We're fighting on five fronts. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=819.44s)]
*  No, we're fighting on seven fronts. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=820.8800000000001s)]
*  And he starts ticking off everyone from the Houthis to the militias in Iraq and Syria, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=822.4000000000001s)]
*  and now Iran, and so forth. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=830.6800000000001s)]
*  If you look at the map today, he's trying to occupy Syria all the way up to the edge [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  of Damascus. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=839.6s)]
*  And Erdogan, who is a very clever but slippery character, has already said, forget it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=840.6s)]
*  We're not going to tolerate that in southern Syria. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=845.9200000000001s)]
*  He's pushing the envelope to the very edge. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=850.16s)]
*  In Damascus, there are three great Islamic cities in the region. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=852.48s)]
*  One is Cairo, the other is Jerusalem, and then Damascus. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=856.28s)]
*  They're not going to surrender Damascus to the Israelis. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=860.1999999999999s)]
*  So whatever happens, the Turks will eventually become involved. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=863.4s)]
*  They'll march in. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=867.36s)]
*  So, I mean, that creates a kind of structural problem because Turkey is a member of NATO. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=868.36s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=875.04s)]
*  Because I don't think NATO matters. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=876.04s)]
*  Maybe you're right. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't think it has for a long time. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=880.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, it matters in a material sense. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  We just used the name NATO to wage a war against Russia for three years that we lost. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=884.56s)]
*  So but that would be the end of NATO, right? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=890.9599999999999s)]
*  What we're talking about will end everything that we're accustomed to. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=894.7199999999999s)]
*  The rules-based order, which just means our global hegemony in military and economic terms. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=897.48s)]
*  Everyone in BRICS is now being forced together. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=905.4s)]
*  We're forcing cohesion on BRICS as an alternative to our financial system, which we use to bully everybody. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=908.4s)]
*  So that's all that BRICS is about. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=915.8s)]
*  But now BRICS is going to become increasingly militarized because we're seen as this rogue [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=917.52s)]
*  state that is willing to put everything at risk in order to retain its position of dominance. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=922.52s)]
*  That's catastrophic for us. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=929.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't want to go down that road. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=931.6s)]
*  That's why I think most of us voted for President Trump. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=934.16s)]
*  We saw him as someone who would say no and diverge from that path. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=937.28s)]
*  But we don't know right now. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=941.88s)]
*  It's not clear. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=943.36s)]
*  He has not made it clear what he wants. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=944.52s)]
*  He has said he wants a settlement with Russia. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=947.6s)]
*  He wants normalization with Russia. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=950.12s)]
*  Okay, if you really want that, you've got to act in a way that demonstrates conclusively [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=952.56s)]
*  that you support that. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  That means end all the military aid right now to the Ukrainians. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=959.1999999999999s)]
*  Period. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=963.36s)]
*  Done. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=964.36s)]
*  Get all of the Americans out of Ukraine immediately. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=965.5600000000001s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=969.0s)]
*  Intelligence, civilians, contractors. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=970.0s)]
*  I mean, this has been another contracting bonanza in Ukraine just as Afghanistan was. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=972.12s)]
*  In Iraq. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=978.92s)]
*  In that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=979.92s)]
*  So the people who built this country built it because they wanted freedom. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=980.92s)]
*  One word freedom. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=983.24s)]
*  They wanted freedom from oppressors who forced them to buy overpriced tea, then blockaded [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=984.24s)]
*  them when they tried to dump it into the ocean. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=988.84s)]
*  How'd that work out? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=990.64s)]
*  Well, we built America in response. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=991.64s)]
*  So it's time to throw your big overpriced wireless contract overboard to a new tea party. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=994.12s)]
*  You don't have to pay $100 a month just to use a phone. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=998.8s)]
*  Most people don't use that much in services, but they pay it anyway. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1002.6s)]
*  Our cell phone company, PureTalk, says no to those prices. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1006.88s)]

*  America's wireless company. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1037.96s)]
*  One of the things you need to do is account for the weapons that you shipped over there [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1038.96s)]
*  and the bio labs that you built there. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1042.76s)]
*  And so Ukraine, the Ukrainian military has been selling, I think everyone's aware of [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1045.28s)]
*  this. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1051.1200000000001s)]
*  It's true. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1052.1200000000001s)]
*  Large percentage of these weapons onto international arms markets and they've wound up with some [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1053.56s)]
*  of the worst people in the world and destabilized the world. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1057.4799999999998s)]
*  But there's been no attempt by any agency in the US government that I'm aware of to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1060.7199999999998s)]
*  keep track of where they are. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1065.1599999999999s)]
*  And moreover, the CIA has lied about that. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  So well, Tucker, let's face it. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1073.4399999999998s)]
*  The CIA is a black hole. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1075.32s)]
*  We don't really know what goes into it and we're not really sure what comes out of it [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1078.6399999999999s)]
*  other than destruction. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1082.0s)]
*  You know, where the CIA dabbles and moves in, we end up with subversion, revolution, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1083.8s)]
*  disintegration. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1091.68s)]
*  That's everything we touch, literally. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1093.48s)]
*  That's why it was such a stroke of genius to get rid of USAID. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1095.4s)]
*  USAID was helping to fund all the nonsense along with National Endowment for Democracy. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1099.48s)]
*  Thank God for those things. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1104.96s)]
*  You know, I don't know about the gentleman Radcliffe who is in charge of the CIA. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1107.28s)]
*  I don't know what his march orders are. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1112.6399999999999s)]
*  But we have a very serious problem over there. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1114.96s)]
*  This has been operating for a very long time in isolation from any accountability and any [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1117.44s)]
*  real oversight. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1123.2s)]
*  So that needs to be stripped down to the bare bolts and find out what's really happening [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1125.6s)]
*  over there. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1129.92s)]
*  Everybody talks about the Epstein files and all these kinds of things. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1130.92s)]
*  Be nice to know the truth about all of that, but there's much worse going on in the CIA [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1135.0800000000002s)]
*  globally and we need to put a stop to it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1140.0s)]
*  But these are actions that we have to take not just for ourselves, but to demonstrate [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  to the rest of the world that we're serious. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1148.0s)]
*  We want an end to these conflicts. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1150.6000000000001s)]
*  We're not interested in waging war in everybody else's country. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1153.48s)]
*  We're not interested in planting new governments that are puppet regimes in other people's [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1156.72s)]
*  countries. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1162.44s)]
*  That's what it's about. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1163.7s)]
*  That's what we've got to do. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1165.38s)]
*  If we don't do that, we're going to eventually be dragged into a confrontation with a substantial [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1166.74s)]
*  portion of the world. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1171.9s)]
*  And then we don't prevail. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1175.3400000000001s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1177.18s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1178.18s)]
*  But keep in mind, what about the American people? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1179.18s)]
*  There's nobody here. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1182.46s)]
*  We walk outside, find anybody who says, well, you know, there's a train leaving for Ukraine. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1183.46s)]
*  You can get all your equipment, draw it right there in the train station, get on and go [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1190.3s)]
*  and fight Ukraine. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1193.72s)]
*  See how many people show up. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1195.08s)]
*  Oh, well, why don't we bomb Iran? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1196.34s)]
*  Would you like to be part of the strike package? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1198.96s)]
*  We have a seat for you on a B2 and you can watch the bombs go off. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1201.1s)]
*  Would you like to do that? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1204.24s)]
*  Nobody wants to do that. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1205.8799999999999s)]
*  There's no interest in this country and any of that crap. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1207.26s)]
*  But people in this country are damn well interested in what's happening on the Mexican border. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1210.48s)]
*  And I just spent three days down there and they're damn well interested in what's happening [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1214.52s)]
*  in Mexico because they know that that is a cesspool of barbarism, savagery, criminality. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1218.28s)]
*  And that's our existential threat. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1226.52s)]
*  Not China, not Russia, not Iran, not anywhere. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1229.6399999999999s)]
*  We can manage those things. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1233.96s)]
*  President Trump can manage those things. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1236.28s)]
*  This thing down on the Mexican border is really at a boiling point. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1238.32s)]
*  We need to understand that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1243.0s)]
*  Tell me, what does that mean? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1245.08s)]
*  Well, what it means is that the cartels run everything. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1246.28s)]
*  I mean, we hear about this President-Shine bomb in Mexico. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1248.72s)]
*  Forget it. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1252.1599999999999s)]
*  She controls what, 40 square kilometers in Mexico City. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1253.8799999999999s)]
*  This whole thing is an organized crime state. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1257.6799999999998s)]
*  Everyone in Mexico knows the truth. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1260.02s)]
*  If you go to Mexico City, my oldest son was just down there for a month and he speaks [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1263.08s)]
*  very fluent Spanish and he was talking to lots of people and he loved the place, loved [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1267.84s)]
*  Mexico City, loves Mexicans. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1272.1999999999998s)]
*  But they'll tell you flat out, well, don't go there and don't go here and don't go there [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1274.56s)]
*  and don't ride in this cab and don't take this automobile. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1277.8799999999999s)]
*  Don't go to that airport. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1281.56s)]
*  Everybody knows the truth. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1284.56s)]
*  Everybody knows who operates what, who controls what. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1286.1399999999999s)]
*  And if you navigate through this maze of invested power of the cartels, you can survive. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1289.1s)]
*  But if you accidentally cross into their territory and are seen as a potential problem in any [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1297.02s)]
*  way, shape or form, you're dead. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1302.56s)]
*  But at the same time, you've got whole families of these cartels, people that work for them [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1306.06s)]
*  that are being treated for dental needs, medical problems, whatever it else. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1311.36s)]
*  I mean, you join the cartel, you get free healthcare. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1316.76s)]
*  You get all of this. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1320.16s)]
*  It's bizarre, but it's real. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1322.72s)]
*  And you pointed out the weapons going down there are serious. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1325.32s)]
*  I was down there and we talked to several people who were border patrolmen, also talked [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1329.36s)]
*  to some Texas guard people and said, we just go a hundred yards on the other side into [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1333.52s)]
*  Mexico and behind the ridge line over there, you'll see all the weapons, all the RPGs, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1339.24s)]
*  the Javelin missile systems that have found their way to Mexico. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1345.36s)]

*  They've got those things over there. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1351.6799999999998s)]
*  From Ukraine? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1352.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1353.6799999999998s)]
*  We sent over, I don't know how many, what, a thousand of them? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1354.8400000000001s)]
*  And several hundred were captured by the Russians. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1358.48s)]
*  And then I'm sure several were sold on the black market. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1362.04s)]
*  I mean, about 50% of everything that showed up there ended up somewhere that didn't belong. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1364.3600000000001s)]
*  It's just one huge corrupt industry in Ukraine. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1372.0800000000002s)]
*  And the longer we feed it cash, the worse it will get. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1376.04s)]
*  So you've got to starve it of cash, starve it of ammunition and end it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1379.4s)]
*  And people will ultimately thank you for it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1384.12s)]
*  They've had enough. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1386.4799999999998s)]
*  I don't care what various people say. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1387.4799999999998s)]
*  They're tired of it. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1390.9199999999998s)]
*  What do you think the actual losses are on both sides in that war? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1391.9199999999998s)]
*  I think the Russians have lost, well, when they say Russians, let's put it this way, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1396.0s)]
*  the Russians, 90 to a hundred thousand dead. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1399.7199999999998s)]
*  They may have lost another 10 to 20,000 non-Russians from within the military establishment. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1402.86s)]
*  That's one of the great achievements, by the way, of President Putin has been to weld this [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1410.28s)]
*  force together that includes large numbers of Muslim Turks who are extremely competent [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1415.24s)]
*  fighters, very tough. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1420.8799999999999s)]
*  In fact, the Chechen fighters are cleaning out Kursk right now, Kursk Oblast, because [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1421.8799999999999s)]
*  the Ukrainians made a mistake. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1428.1599999999999s)]
*  They hurled large numbers of drones down into Chechnya and killed a number of people and [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1430.12s)]
*  that just lit a fuse that is now exploding. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1435.52s)]
*  Who'd want to fight with Chechnya? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1438.3600000000001s)]
*  I certainly don't. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1439.8400000000001s)]
*  No normal man wants to fight the Turks. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1441.96s)]
*  Right, I mean, there's two wars. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1443.72s)]
*  I mean, I'm not an expert, but I sort of followed it in the news. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1445.16s)]
*  Maybe not want to mess with the Chechens at all. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1448.8400000000001s)]
*  Never, ever. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1452.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1453.8s)]
*  And there's a good, healthy relationship right now between the Muslims and the Orthodox [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1455.2s)]
*  Christians. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1459.4s)]
*  Yes, I've noticed. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1460.4s)]
*  It's a very positive thing. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1461.4s)]
*  He's done that very well. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1463.44s)]
*  There's a lot to be learned from that. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1464.44s)]
*  I think we could do something similar in some respects, but having said that, the problem [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1466.72s)]
*  is right now, 100,000 plus 10 to 20,000 of the others, that's about it. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1470.68s)]
*  But on the Ukrainian side, I can certainly account through the various sources I trust [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1478.0800000000002s)]
*  for 1.2 million dead Ukrainian soldiers. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1483.2s)]
*  Dead? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1485.8400000000001s)]
*  Dead. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1486.8400000000001s)]
*  There are those out there. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1487.8400000000001s)]
*  So you think it's 10 to 1. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1488.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, easily. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1489.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's because over the last year. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1490.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, that is just shocking. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1493.2s)]
*  Yeah, but over the last year, it's grown. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1495.32s)]
*  In other words, the losses have just tripled and quadrupled every day. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1498.16s)]
*  You can watch people like Larry Johnson and Scott Ritter and others. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1505.68s)]
*  They all have different numbers and different sources, but they all agree. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1509.2s)]
*  1.2 million is about right. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1512.72s)]
*  There are some who think 1.5 million is closer. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1515.76s)]
*  Dead. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1518.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1519.64s)]
*  And what happens at the end of wars? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1520.64s)]
*  In a country of under 50 million, so about 25 million in the country now, I think, ish. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1522.36s)]
*  There's nothing left. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1527.36s)]
*  That's why the notion that they can build anything now is ridiculous. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1529.24s)]
*  And how many millions are overseas? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1533.6s)]
*  What, 15 to 20 million have left the country? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1535.3999999999999s)]
*  There are 2 million plus Ukrainians in Russia and probably 15 plus million in the West. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1539.12s)]
*  And most of them have made it clear they have no intention of ever going back. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1546.1999999999998s)]
*  So this is killed for all intents and purposes for the foreseeable future, the Ukrainian [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1550.48s)]
*  nation. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1556.52s)]
*  But these things happen at the end of wars. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1557.9s)]
*  Most of the Germans killed in the military towards the end of the Second World War were [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1559.96s)]
*  killed in the last nine months. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1565.22s)]
*  Max Hastings wrote a book about it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1568.68s)]
*  I can't remember the exact title. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1570.52s)]
*  It wasn't perfect, but it wasn't a bad illustration of what was going on. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1572.76s)]
*  When armies are retreating and they've lost their air and missile defense, they've lost [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1577.96s)]
*  their logistics, in other words, units are breaking down because they can't feed themselves, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1583.0s)]
*  they can't protect themselves. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1588.88s)]
*  So it becomes not immediately every man for himself, but the units try to fight their [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1590.76s)]
*  way through to get back home. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1595.68s)]
*  And that's what the Ukrainians have done. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1597.92s)]
*  But as they're doing that, the problem today is with all of these unmanned systems and [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1599.98s)]
*  surveillance that the Russians have, they can be killed in great numbers as they're [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1604.8s)]
*  running away, as they're leaving. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1608.8s)]
*  And they're not running away because they're cowards. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1610.56s)]
*  Nobody will tell you the Ukrainians are cowards. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1612.9599999999998s)]
*  It's absolutely unacceptable. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1614.76s)]
*  These are very brave, courageous people just like the Russians. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1617.3999999999999s)]
*  But they have no chance. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1621.08s)]
*  And so they're being driven in front of the advancing Russians. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1622.76s)]
*  And people say, well, why are the Russians advancing so slowly? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1626.4399999999998s)]
*  Because from the very beginning, Putin has not wanted to kill large numbers of Orthodox [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1630.22s)]
*  Christian Slavs. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1635.82s)]
*  It's not been his aim. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1637.38s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's definitely the aim of the West. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1639.74s)]
*  Oh, my, look at these, look at these bio labs. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1642.14s)]
*  Isn't that pretty clear from what we've seen? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1647.46s)]
*  It's pretty clear. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1649.26s)]
*  And so if you take three steps back, I mean, Ukraine is not even, it's not even the point. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1650.26s)]
*  The point is destroying Putin. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1655.58s)]
*  And killing Russia and breaking it up. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1659.6200000000001s)]
*  And if you kill large numbers of Ukrainians, I think for many of the people behind this, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1661.5800000000002s)]
*  that was seen as collateral damage or even a bonus. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1665.14s)]
*  I hate to make that point. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1668.78s)]
*  I agree completely. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1671.14s)]
*  I agree. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1672.14s)]
*  Killing Christians around the world is the actual subtext to our foreign policy. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1673.14s)]
*  Someone has handed me this. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1677.3400000000001s)]
*  This is just out. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1679.3000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine backs US proposal for 30-day ceasefire with Russia. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1680.3000000000002s)]

*  Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1693.5s)]
*  A ceasefire implemented would be a major diplomatic breakthrough. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1696.1399999999999s)]
*  Da da da da. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1699.1799999999998s)]
*  This is Rubio, quote, the secretary of state. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1700.1799999999998s)]
*  The ball is now in their court. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1703.22s)]
*  We hope the Russians will reciprocate. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1704.3799999999999s)]
*  The US agreed to lift its suspension on intelligence sharing with Ukraine and resume weapons shipments [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1708.94s)]
*  to the country which were paused 10 days ago. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1715.06s)]

*  After weeks of pressure in the Ukrainians, the US side signaled the pressure is now on [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1720.54s)]
*  Russia, quote, if the Russians say no, we will know what the impediment is here, said [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1723.42s)]
*  Marco Rubio. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1728.42s)]
*  National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said Ukraine not only accepted the US proposal [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1730.1s)]
*  but also presented its principles for a comprehensive peace deal which includes security guarantees [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1733.34s)]
*  that it requires. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1738.24s)]
*  Waltz also made clear to his team that all fighting needs to stop, not just air and [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1739.7s)]
*  missile strikes, before we negotiate, need to stop shooting at each other. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1744.38s)]

*  Well, I think there's some positive things in there, but we're missing the boat with [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1777.5s)]
*  the Russians again. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1781.5s)]
*  We don't understand that if Ukraine is going to be neutral, why are we continuing to supply [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1782.5s)]
*  it with weapons at this stage? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1787.78s)]
*  It's the Ukrainians that have to stop fighting. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1790.46s)]
*  The Russians will stop when they see evidence that the Ukrainian force is defeated or quits. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1792.42s)]
*  That hasn't happened yet. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1799.72s)]
*  What with these attacks that just occurred over Moscow? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1800.86s)]
*  So the Russians are asking the question, you're the ones keeping this monster alive. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1804.02s)]
*  You created the monster, the monster is fatally wounded, and you keep putting it on life support. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1808.9799999999998s)]
*  Do you really want an end to this war? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1815.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, imagine if we were dealing with a similar enemy in Mexico and we found out that [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1817.4199999999998s)]
*  the Russians and the Chinese had provided vast quantities of equipment and assistance [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1823.1s)]
*  to the Mexicans who were trying to fight us and regain control of the Southwest. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1828.82s)]
*  And we defeated them and driven them back out of the country, and they refused to stop. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1834.94s)]
*  They continue to fight. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1840.68s)]
*  We said, well, if you want this war to end, tell them to stop fighting, put down their [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1841.68s)]
*  weapons and back out. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1846.5s)]
*  And if they won't do that, then we have to do what? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1848.6200000000001s)]
*  March into Mexico and crush them. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1850.66s)]
*  This is the best analogy that I can come up with to make people understand what we're [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1853.46s)]
*  dealing with. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1857.42s)]
*  So if you want normalized relations with Russia, go back to what we said at the beginning. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1858.8200000000002s)]
*  End the military support for this heinous regime. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1865.7s)]
*  This is guilty of all sorts of terrible war crimes anyway. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1868.8200000000002s)]
*  All the things that Russia was accused of are things that the Ukrainians have done. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1871.94s)]
*  So let's get out of this. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1876.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, they tried to, and the assassinating people, they tried to assassinate a couple [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1877.78s)]
*  of people I know personally well. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1881.1000000000001s)]
*  Fact, not guessing. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1883.46s)]
*  So I consider that government, not the Ukrainians, I think the Ukrainians, as you said, are valiant [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1886.94s)]
*  and decent. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1894.3400000000001s)]
*  An awful lot of them are Christians. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1895.3400000000001s)]
*  I know a lot of Ukrainians, and I couldn't think more highly of them, but I think that [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1896.98s)]
*  their government is totally evil. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1901.5800000000002s)]
*  Completely. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1904.26s)]
*  And so here's the thinking as far as I understand it. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1905.5s)]
*  What do I know? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1907.42s)]
*  But my strong sense is that the Trump White House wants to end to this war. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1908.42s)]
*  The president campaigned on it. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1914.14s)]
*  He thinks it's within his grasp. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1916.02s)]
*  He also wants a more normalized relationship with Russia. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1918.58s)]
*  He grieves over Russia's now permanent alliance with China. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1922.6s)]
*  He sees how bad that is. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1926.56s)]
*  It's not fixable. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1928.1s)]
*  But bringing Russia a little bit closer back to the West is a good thing. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1929.76s)]
*  I think I'm describing his thinking fairly. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1934.16s)]
*  But for the purposes of making a deal, the thought is that you can't make a deal from [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1937.26s)]
*  a position of weakness. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1943.08s)]
*  And so you have to show your teeth in order to get the other side to come to better terms. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1944.78s)]
*  That's the idea behind throwing more weapons to Ukraine. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1951.7s)]
*  How do you assess that? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1954.78s)]
*  It's delusional. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1955.78s)]
*  It's leading down the wrong path. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1957.5s)]
*  If you want this to end, then stop it. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1959.3799999999999s)]
*  You stop supplying it and get our people out of Ukraine. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1961.86s)]
*  Make it very clear we're out of this. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1964.94s)]
*  No more weapons, no more cash. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1967.8999999999999s)]
*  We're finished. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1970.1s)]
*  The British and the French can't come in and make up for that. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1971.24s)]
*  Neither can the Germans. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1973.66s)]
*  So that's all nonsense. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1974.66s)]
*  You saw this Euro Summit. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1976.5800000000002s)]
*  They're going to assemble what? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1978.5s)]
*  Almost a trillion dollars to beef up defense in these countries. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1979.9s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1983.78s)]
*  I don't see that occurring in Europe at all. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1984.78s)]
*  Because the average Europeans are saying, for what? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1987.26s)]
*  They look at what's happening and they no longer believe this myth. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1989.8600000000001s)]
*  The Russians are coming. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1993.1000000000001s)]
*  The Russians are coming. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1994.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, the Russians are coming. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1995.1000000000001s)]
*  They're going to be on I-95 in northern Jersey tomorrow night. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=1996.98s)]
*  Come on, the Russians are coming. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2000.22s)]
*  We have to kill them here. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2001.22s)]
*  You hear Republicans say this all the time. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2002.76s)]
*  Republican senators, really the worst group in the country, in my opinion, short of Antifa. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2004.92s)]
*  But it's a really good deal for us because we're killing all these European Christians [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2009.08s)]
*  there so we don't have to kill them here. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2017.04s)]
*  And they say that out loud. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2019.04s)]
*  Well they said that to Lyndon Johnson. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2020.84s)]
*  We said, well, if we don't kill them here now in Vietnam, we're going to be fighting [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2022.44s)]
*  them in Los Angeles. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2027.76s)]
*  So we got to get them now. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2029.82s)]
*  Come on. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2031.3600000000001s)]
*  That was ridiculous. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2032.36s)]
*  I heard General Abbasade make the same stupid statement in 2004. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2033.36s)]
*  Well, we have to kill these Islamist terrorists here in Iraq or we'll be fighting them in [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2037.4399999999998s)]
*  our own country. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2043.32s)]
*  It's all crap. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2044.32s)]
*  It's the same old set of lies. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2045.32s)]
*  It's sort of like the perpetual neocon narrative. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2047.36s)]
*  It's 1936. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2052.2799999999997s)]
*  We all have to band together. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2054.56s)]
*  There's another Hitlerite on the horizon. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2056.08s)]
*  This is a standard sort of gruel that is pitched to the American people over and over [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2059.28s)]
*  and over again in the Anglosphere in general, whether it's Great Britain, Australia. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2064.7200000000003s)]
*  It's all nonsense. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2070.36s)]
*  We got to get past this and once and for all, bury it. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2071.84s)]
*  If we really want this to stop, this is not about winning or losing. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2075.6000000000004s)]
*  I think that's another problem. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2079.6800000000003s)]
*  We've got to make sure this is a win for the president. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2081.2000000000003s)]
*  A win for the president is an end to this war, period. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2084.36s)]
*  Number two, what are our interests in Ukraine? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2089.84s)]
*  Tell me what they are. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2093.48s)]
*  What are the strategic interests that justify intervention in that country? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2095.2400000000002s)]
*  Time's up. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2100.6s)]
*  There are none. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2101.6s)]
*  We've never had any interest in Ukraine whatsoever. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2103.32s)]
*  We wish them well. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2106.0s)]
*  We want them to be happy and prosperous, but we have never had any interest in defending [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2107.88s)]
*  them against anybody under any circumstances. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2113.28s)]
*  We've got to get back to what's rational, not what's emotional. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2118.0400000000004s)]
*  The president just needs to look at this and say, we need to stop this. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2121.6800000000003s)]
*  He can be a world historical figure if he ends the carnage in Ukraine by simply saying, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2128.0800000000004s)]
*  that's it, we're out, and then turns around to the Middle East and says, stop now. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2135.1600000000003s)]
*  No more mass murder and expulsion of human beings from Gaza or the West Bank or anywhere [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2140.88s)]
*  else. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2146.4s)]
*  If he's willing to do those things, he's a world historical figure. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2147.56s)]
*  That's a dramatic sea change in the history, I would say, of the West and probably of the [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2151.2000000000003s)]
*  world. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2156.44s)]
*  But instead what we get is, oh, we can't do that, we'll look weak. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2157.88s)]
*  It's sort of the argument that Kissinger made to Nixon. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2161.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, we can't just leave Vietnam. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2164.56s)]
*  Well, that's exactly what the hell we did, right? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2167.08s)]
*  We left. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2170.48s)]
*  So no, we got to go into Cambodia to show them that we're strong. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2172.04s)]
*  How many people did we lose in Cambodia needlessly? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2176.34s)]
*  It's the same mentality. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2178.64s)]
*  Just be honest. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2182.04s)]
*  This is over. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2183.04s)]
*  And then tell the Europeans, these are people that we're supposedly allied with, that they [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2184.88s)]
*  need to sit down at the table with Moscow and we're happy to be there. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2189.0s)]
*  We'll sponsor it. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2193.64s)]
*  We'll set them up and they can sort it out. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2195.36s)]
*  So far in the other direction, like in the UK right now, even Nigel Farage, head of the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2197.08s)]
*  Reform Party, which I think is the biggest party, doesn't have power, but it's by registration [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2202.6s)]

*  and the pathetic castrated Tories. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2214.7599999999998s)]
*  They won't say that we should end the war in Ukraine. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2219.06s)]
*  Even they won't. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2223.2s)]
*  I mean, it's like there's nobody. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2224.2s)]
*  There's no party that I'm aware of in all of Europe with power that will say that. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2226.34s)]
*  Well you said with power. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2232.2200000000003s)]
*  There are plenty of parties out there advocating. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2233.82s)]
*  There are. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2235.82s)]
*  AFD, the Alternative für Deutschland, is not a far right party. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2236.82s)]
*  I hear that all the time. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2242.02s)]
*  Anything that challenges the status quo is also far right. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2243.42s)]
*  Anything Applebaum doesn't want. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2247.1000000000004s)]
*  It's a bunch of nonsense. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2248.82s)]
*  They want an end to this. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2250.84s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2252.02s)]
*  None of this ever made sense for Germany under any circumstances. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2253.34s)]
*  Well it destroyed Germany. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2256.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2257.78s)]
*  The Germans have destroyed Germany, not the Russians. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2258.78s)]
*  And the Russians have no interest in destroying Germany. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2262.46s)]
*  It's the ruling classes in these countries. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2265.38s)]
*  They're globalist and they need to be removed. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2267.6000000000004s)]
*  And they will be removed. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2270.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm confident that it will happen. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2271.26s)]
*  The British have not had a real revolution since Cromwell, but I think they've reached [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2273.92s)]
*  the point now where they very much need a Cromwellian figure to clean house because [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2278.1000000000004s)]
*  the people ruling them are weak and inept. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2282.7s)]
*  Do you see any path to that happening? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2285.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2291.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2292.5s)]
*  I haven't been to Britain for many years. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2293.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2295.14s)]
*  No, I have not. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2296.14s)]
*  I think the last time I was in Britain was 2005. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2297.14s)]
*  Don't go. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2302.7799999999997s)]
*  It'll make you too sad. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2303.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2304.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, you're talking to somebody who worships at the altar of English speaking civilization. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2305.7799999999997s)]
*  Me too. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2310.62s)]
*  I don't even want to think about it. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2311.66s)]
*  But I think there are still enough Scots, Welsh, English, and Irish there who will stand [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2313.62s)]
*  up and be counted. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2318.18s)]
*  I'm cheered up by somebody like Conor McGregor that stands up and defends Irish national [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2320.18s)]
*  culture, identity, language, everything. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2325.2599999999998s)]
*  All of the Europeans need to come to Jesus on this one. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2329.5s)]
*  They need to come very, very soon. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2332.2999999999997s)]
*  And that doesn't mean they're evil. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2334.54s)]
*  It means that they're defending the one thing that is worth defending, which is their own [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2335.8199999999997s)]
*  country, their own nation, their own society. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2340.94s)]
*  So I hope that that will happen. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2343.5s)]
*  We need to do the same thing. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2345.34s)]
*  And that's why I went down to the border. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2347.38s)]
*  Not because, and again, this has nothing to do with whether you love or dislike Mexicans. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2350.42s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2355.78s)]
*  Mexicans are fine. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2356.78s)]
*  That's not the issue. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2358.0600000000004s)]
*  Everyone likes Mexicans. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2359.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, everybody does. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2360.0600000000004s)]
*  No one's against Mexicans. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2361.0600000000004s)]
*  The bottom line though is that our border is the soft underbelly of the country. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2362.1400000000003s)]
*  It's a strategic vulnerability. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2367.74s)]
*  And what exists in Latin America, in Central America, in Mexico is very dangerous to us. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2370.06s)]
*  And if we don't wake up and start focusing on it, it will ultimately destroy us. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2376.54s)]
*  How many hundreds of thousands have we lost? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2383.22s)]
*  500,000 people, defentinal poisoning. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2385.3799999999997s)]
*  And somebody says, whoa, Chinese, wait a minute. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2388.2999999999997s)]
*  The Chinese ship ingredients, they're mixed down in Mexico. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2391.06s)]
*  You don't like the fact that Chinese sold the ingredients? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2395.58s)]
*  Fine. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2398.1s)]
*  You can ban the Chinese from exporting to the United States. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2399.1s)]
*  I don't care what you do. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2402.74s)]
*  Don't go to war with China. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2403.74s)]
*  The people that are mixing the poison and then mainlining it into the country, they're [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2405.66s)]
*  the cartels in Mexico. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2409.86s)]
*  And by the way, they have a lot of support here. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2411.7s)]
*  Their influence reaches right up into DHS, all the way to Congress. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2414.7s)]
*  There are so many people on the payroll, I'm told, after my visit down to the border. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2419.22s)]
*  It's frightening. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2424.52s)]
*  American officials on the payroll of Mexican drug cartels. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2426.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2429.2s)]
*  The other thing, as an example, I said, well, have we stopped everything? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2430.28s)]
*  And you talk to sheriffs. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2434.56s)]
*  And I went down there and talked to really a great man, and he's a huge supporter of [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2436.88s)]
*  President Trump, as I am. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2441.68s)]
*  And I walked into his office, this building, and here's this life-size photograph of Donald [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2443.32s)]
*  Trump pointing at you. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2450.84s)]
*  I thought it was Trump. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2453.4s)]
*  I mean, I really did. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2454.84s)]
*  I said, my God, how did the president get here ahead of all of us? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2455.84s)]
*  It was about the same time that Vance and Tulsi and Hegseth went to Eagle Pass. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2458.7200000000003s)]
*  And this was Kinney County, and this was Sheriff Coe. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2464.4s)]
*  And Sheriff Coe says, oh, things have gotten so much better. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2468.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2472.1600000000003s)]
*  The optics are much better. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2473.1600000000003s)]
*  There are no longer thousands of people marching over the border anymore. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2474.1600000000003s)]
*  But what about the legal ports of entry? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2477.84s)]
*  The Border Patrol has nothing to do with the legal ports of entry. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2481.28s)]
*  Those are controlled by police authorities, customs police, and others. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2484.1200000000003s)]
*  And I said, well, what's the problem with the legal ports of entry? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2489.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, most of the drugs and a lot of the human trafficking comes through the legal ports. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2492.96s)]
*  I said, well, how does that happen? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2498.84s)]
*  They said, well, if somebody comes up to you and you make normally $3,000 or $4,000 a month, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2500.88s)]
*  and they say, here's $20,000. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2506.6800000000003s)]
*  Let us through. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2509.84s)]
*  You get through. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2510.94s)]
*  And that's part of the problem on the border. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2513.14s)]
*  So I said, well, what do you think needs to happen? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2516.38s)]
*  And people told me privately, you need to get the US Army on the border. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2518.3s)]
*  Bring back the regular army and then rotate them. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2522.42s)]
*  And the army's not on the border? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2524.7000000000003s)]
*  No, they just sent a brigade. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2525.7000000000003s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2527.7400000000002s)]
*  But we have, I think, six or seven of these brigades of motorized infantry, these light [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2528.7400000000002s)]
*  armored vehicles, put them on the border. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2533.48s)]
*  We need 40, 50, 60,000 troops down there. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2536.2200000000003s)]
*  We need some aviation brigades down there. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2539.28s)]
*  Now, they don't all have to stay there forever, but they need to stay there until the barriers [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2541.1600000000003s)]
*  are built and the border is secure. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2545.7400000000002s)]
*  And then we need to come up with a system where we periodically rotate units down there [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2548.02s)]
*  to back up the police, back up the border patrol. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2552.5600000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2556.32s)]
*  Because the cartels are infinitely better armed than the police and the border patrol. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2557.32s)]
*  They have javelin missile systems. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2562.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2565.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2566.32s)]
*  They've got unmanned systems for ISR, for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2567.36s)]
*  They've got armed unmanned systems. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2572.0800000000004s)]
*  And the thing that nobody seems to understand is what happens when we finally stop it? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2574.96s)]
*  You stop the drugs. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2581.0s)]
*  You stop the human trafficking along the border. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2582.54s)]
*  Now, they're going to try and go around you. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2584.7200000000003s)]
*  They'll try to use the coastal waters. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2586.6400000000003s)]
*  I think the Coast Guard belongs in the United States, not in the South China Sea, not in [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2588.92s)]
*  the Persian Gulf. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2594.6000000000004s)]
*  They're not going to go along here and they're not. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2595.6s)]
*  They need to bring them back and get them. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2597.92s)]
*  We have the Coast Guard in the Persian Gulf? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2599.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2601.72s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2602.72s)]

*  I know him well, yeah. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2616.88s)]
*  He's done great work down there at all these camps. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2617.88s)]
*  The American federal government has actually helped to fund these non-governmental organizations [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2621.52s)]
*  in order to sponsor millions of people to invade our country and give them phones. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2627.24s)]
*  You know the routine. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2632.56s)]
*  I do. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2633.56s)]
*  They're still there. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2634.56s)]
*  Those camps are still there. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2635.56s)]
*  Somebody needs to go down and torch those things. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2636.56s)]
*  In other words, it needs to be scorched earth down there. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2639.0s)]
*  Get rid of this. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2641.94s)]

*  you have truly a secure border. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2647.66s)]

*  One ultrasound costs just $28. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2734.52s)]
*  That means $5,000 sponsors a day's worth for the entire pre-born network. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2736.92s)]
*  Every child is a gift from God, the gift from God, and pre-born needs help to make sure [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2741.84s)]

*  It will help us enormously. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2813.56s)]

*  And historically, when Herbert Hoover directed the removal of 9 million Mexicans after the [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2838.7599999999998s)]

*  Put the Army in charge. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2873.48s)]
*  United States Army, supplemented by the police and the National Guard. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2875.52s)]
*  And they organized it and executed it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2880.32s)]
*  We've got to do that. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2882.8s)]
*  How many of those people are sleeper cells for various terrorist organizations around [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2884.16s)]

*  And I don't see anybody expressing that concern anywhere. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=2906.08s)]

*  And it's distressing because it does seem like the problems that we face now will determine [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3022.96s)]
*  whether the United States remains... [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3031.0s)]
*  Makes it. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3034.7999999999997s)]
*  Makes it. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3035.7999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3036.7999999999997s)]
*  Nicely put. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3037.7999999999997s)]
*  Makes it. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3038.7999999999997s)]
*  So just to bottom line on a couple of issues. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3039.7999999999997s)]
*  How would you rate the likelihood? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3043.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, it does seem like the president, having run on the promise of peace in Eastern Europe [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3044.7999999999997s)]
*  and inserted himself right into the middle of it, being the only person who can bring [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3050.16s)]
*  peace, you know, he kind of has to see this through and likely will. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3054.56s)]
*  How hard will it be to get some sort of settlement between Ukraine and Russia? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3061.96s)]
*  Well, he has to keep something in mind. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3065.8399999999997s)]
*  You cannot turn around after the American government and all of its agencies have worked [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3068.56s)]
*  tirelessly to kill, maim, murder, harm as many Russians as possible. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3075.08s)]
*  Including Putin himself. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3082.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3083.48s)]
*  Over the last, what, three and a half years. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3084.48s)]
*  So we have to understand that. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3086.2s)]
*  You just can't... [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3087.2s)]
*  You can't just flip the switch and say, sorry, we want to be friends now. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3088.7s)]
*  However much you may want to do that, you can't. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3094.64s)]
*  You've got to admit this is a catastrophe and we are mightily responsible. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3097.56s)]
*  And that's why I would urge the president to do exactly what I said. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3102.72s)]
*  End all aid to Ukraine. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3107.24s)]
*  Stop pretending that that government and anything we've done in that country is a positive thing. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3108.68s)]
*  It's not. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3113.96s)]
*  Has nothing to do with liberal democracy. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3115.12s)]
*  Has nothing to do with goodness in any form. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3117.68s)]
*  What we've done there is terrible. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3121.18s)]
*  What we need to do is stop it. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3123.08s)]
*  So stop sending any aid and then get everybody out. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3125.24s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3129.64s)]
*  And then offer to host a conference between, and I would not argue everybody in Europe, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3130.64s)]
*  but I would certainly argue all of the states that border Russia and Germany. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3136.12s)]
*  Because Germany may not border Russia, but Germany has long-term strategic interests [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3142.24s)]
*  in Russia as Russia has in Germany. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3146.3999999999996s)]
*  They should all meet in a conference room and agree to a new map with new borders. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3149.16s)]
*  We don't need to draw those. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3156.04s)]
*  They need to draw those. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3157.64s)]
*  And Europeans can do that. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3159.3199999999997s)]
*  They have been around forever. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3160.54s)]
*  How many times have European borders changed in the last thousand years? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3162.58s)]
*  They've redrawn some maps over time. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3165.52s)]
*  I can't even keep up. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3167.56s)]
*  Of course. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3168.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, try to find like the map of what's now called Ukraine. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3169.8799999999997s)]
*  How many iterations in the past? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3177.32s)]
*  Just hundred years. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3179.7400000000002s)]
*  Too many. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3180.7400000000002s)]
*  Too many do even count. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3181.7400000000002s)]
*  You can't even keep up. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3182.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3183.7400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3184.7400000000002s)]
*  And stop this nonsense about, well, you can't trust the Russians. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3185.7400000000002s)]
*  They're going to take advantage. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3187.7400000000002s)]
*  Come on. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3189.6400000000003s)]
*  This is nonsense. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3190.6400000000003s)]
*  They've lost a hundred, 120,000 human lives. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3192.04s)]
*  You really think they want to continue? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3196.04s)]
*  There's no interest in that at all. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3198.1600000000003s)]
*  And you know, what's really distinguished to President Putin from all of his predecessors, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3200.4s)]
*  I would argue, is his concern for the lives of Russian soldiers. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3205.16s)]
*  None of his predecessors were ever that concerned about how many lives they lost. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3212.2799999999997s)]
*  You go back to the First World War and Nicholas II was a good man, but he was willing to accept [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3216.8799999999997s)]
*  tremendous losses if he thought he was going to pave the road to victory with Russian dead. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3222.64s)]
*  That's not Putin. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3229.3399999999997s)]
*  That's not what he wants. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3230.3799999999997s)]
*  Lavrov doesn't want it. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3231.3799999999997s)]
*  The general staff doesn't want it. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3232.7599999999998s)]
*  The population doesn't want it. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3234.58s)]
*  So we need to stop that nonsense. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3236.06s)]
*  And that's about as much as we can do. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3238.86s)]
*  We're not going to overnight cultivate new friendship with them. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3241.24s)]
*  It's going to take at least a decade, probably two decades to restore some sort of normalcy [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3245.7s)]
*  to our relationship. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3250.66s)]
*  Mineral deal in Ukraine wise? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3251.98s)]
*  I don't understand what this is. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3253.58s)]
*  I'm interested in rare earths, okay? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3256.66s)]
*  And I've done some work in that area. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3259.38s)]
*  And rare earths can be found anywhere on the planet. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3261.86s)]
*  However, not in high concentrations. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3265.3s)]
*  We just found the highest concentration of rare earths in Europe right off the coast [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3268.58s)]
*  of Norway. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3272.86s)]
*  I love the Norwegians. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3273.86s)]
*  I'm very happy for them. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3274.86s)]
*  Although they're a bit lunatic when it comes to understanding what's happening in Ukraine. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3276.7000000000003s)]
*  They have enough natural resources already in Norway. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3279.86s)]
*  It seems that they're overblast. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3282.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3284.3s)]
*  But I mean, they have it and that's good. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3285.3s)]
*  I don't know what he's talking about. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3288.1s)]
*  I don't know what the president is talking about in Ukraine because all of those rare [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3289.66s)]
*  earths in any kind of concentration are in Eastern Ukraine under Russian feet right now [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3293.58s)]
*  or in Crimea. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3299.58s)]
*  Well, so maybe that is kind of the point. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3300.58s)]
*  And look, if that's the case, pack up, get out. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3302.98s)]
*  And at some point, let's do business with the Russians because the Ukrainians are not [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3307.42s)]
*  going to have those concentrations. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3311.86s)]
*  So I'm aware, I knew that's why I asked you the question because I knew that and I'm, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3313.42s)]
*  or I think I know that. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3318.1s)]
*  And so it makes me wonder like if Zelensky is now anxious to sign the seal and was anxious [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3319.14s)]
*  before to sign the deal before his arrogance and bad advice got in the way. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3324.98s)]
*  Maybe what this really is, is a way to change US policy or and sort of have us try and force [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3329.7s)]
*  the Russians to withdraw from Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, which of course is not going [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3339.46s)]
*  to happen. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3342.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's how many, how many Rs are there in fat chance? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3344.58s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3349.94s)]
*  By the way, there are marvelous concentrations of rare earths in Canada. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3351.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3355.46s)]
*  You know, historically we've been friends. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3356.46s)]
*  Come on. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3358.46s)]
*  What are we doing over there with rare earths? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3360.58s)]
*  This is nuts. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3362.58s)]
*  Let's do business with the Canadians. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3364.34s)]
*  They've got rich deposits of rare earths. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3365.9s)]
*  We have some here in the United States. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3368.06s)]
*  And since we have the opportunity to talk about this a little bit, I'd like to help out my [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3370.46s)]
*  friends in Southern Kentucky because you have coal seams in Southern Kentucky, finest coal [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3373.62s)]
*  in the world, by the way, very high BTUs, very low phosphorus burns, clean, very hot. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3378.8599999999997s)]
*  And in the coal seams, there are rare earths in abundance. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3386.0s)]
*  And in all the old slag heaps and all the containment pools from many, many decades [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3390.06s)]
*  of mining, there are rare earths. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3395.66s)]
*  So Kentucky, Southern Kentucky should be a boom economy in the future. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3399.98s)]
*  If anybody has any brains, go down there and start mining for rare earths. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3405.14s)]
*  You don't even have to dig it up. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3410.78s)]
*  It's in the slag heaps and in the pools. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3412.78s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3415.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3416.34s)]
*  Now, we don't have a refinery. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3417.34s)]
*  I don't know if we have a refinery here in the United States. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3419.66s)]
*  The biggest refineries that do the best job are in Kazakhstan, outer Mongolia, and in [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3422.66s)]
*  China, inner Mongolia. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3428.58s)]
*  So we ship this stuff over there. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3432.18s)]
*  Wouldn't it make sense to pass a bill and build refineries so we refine our own rare [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3435.02s)]
*  earths here inside the United States? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3441.98s)]
*  And this is the sort of thing President Trump talks about all the time. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3444.06s)]
*  And he's absolutely dead right. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3447.7s)]
*  That's what we should be doing. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3450.46s)]
*  Forget this business in Ukraine. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3451.98s)]
*  It's a waste of time. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3454.16s)]
*  We don't need to do that. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3455.16s)]
*  We need to search for opportunities right under our noses right now in this hemisphere. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3456.78s)]
*  This is where we live. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3462.1800000000003s)]
*  You might as well do it here. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3463.9s)]
*  A lot's going to need to change. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3466.86s)]
*  Oh, and listen, he's done so many good things with his executive orders here at home. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3469.6600000000003s)]
*  Now, I don't know about the depth of planning. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3475.34s)]
*  I don't know about the strategy. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3477.98s)]
*  It'll take time to see what's there. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3479.7000000000003s)]
*  But he set the forces in motion in the right direction. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3482.34s)]
*  All of that could be lost by bad decisions in the Middle East or Eastern Europe. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3486.62s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3493.18s)]
*  I mean, I know the head of CENTCOM, I think, is very anxious to have new wars in the Middle [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3494.18s)]
*  East. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3499.18s)]
*  Who is the CENTCOM commander right now? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3501.7s)]
*  Is it? [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3503.66s)]
*  Karilla, I think. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3504.66s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3505.66s)]
*  Really? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3506.66s)]
*  You have that impression? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3507.66s)]
*  I do. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3508.66s)]
*  Well, then it's time to ask for his papers and send him on his way. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3511.66s)]
*  It's like saying, I think it's a great time to contract syphilis. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3519.2599999999998s)]
*  Let's go get it. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3522.42s)]
*  You know? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3523.42s)]
*  To hell with that. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3524.42s)]
*  Do you think at the Pentagon, you no longer work at the Pentagon, but if you were to spend [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3526.3399999999997s)]
*  a week there talking to people off the record, what would be the level of support for new [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3531.3399999999997s)]
*  wars? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3536.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, first of all, remember that your General Officer Corps is different from the rest of [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3537.86s)]
*  the officer corps. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3542.7400000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3543.7400000000002s)]
*  That doesn't mean there aren't lots of full colonels out there who are desperate to be [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3544.7400000000002s)]
*  generals. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3548.1000000000004s)]
*  And so they'll try to provide you with the answer they think is most likely to get them [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3549.1000000000004s)]
*  promoted. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3553.5800000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3554.5800000000004s)]
*  Okay? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3555.5800000000004s)]
*  But when you go into the General Officer Corps at the three and four star level, they have [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3556.5800000000004s)]
*  been conditioned for decades to look for trouble, literally. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3560.1400000000003s)]
*  In other words, go out and find a reason why we need Central Command. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3565.78s)]
*  We need Africa Command. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3571.06s)]
*  We need European Command. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3572.68s)]
*  We need Pacific Command. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3574.7s)]
*  Now we call it Indo-Pacific Insane. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3575.82s)]
*  When I was sitting over at the National Defense University before I retired, they came over [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3579.2599999999998s)]
*  and said, well, we're going to have Africa Command. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3585.06s)]
*  And I looked at, and Abizade at the time was the J5. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3589.06s)]
*  I said, why? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3591.9s)]
*  I mean, how would you feel if you're an African? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3594.38s)]
*  Well, the United States military has now created a command and calls it Africa Command. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3596.38s)]
*  How's that good for Africa? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3602.58s)]
*  Are you planning on invading? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3605.38s)]
*  You know? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3606.86s)]
*  I mean, having been to Africa, the last thing Africans need is a column of US or British [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3607.86s)]
*  or French troops marching through the neighborhood. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3614.24s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3617.54s)]
*  They have enough violence and problems there. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3618.54s)]
*  We don't need to add to it. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3620.58s)]
*  I think President Trump wants to get rid of Africa Command. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3622.02s)]
*  We don't need most of these. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3625.34s)]
*  We should have four. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3626.9s)]
*  We should have Northern Command, Pacific Command, Southern Command, and Atlantic Command. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3628.48s)]
*  That's it. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3634.38s)]
*  You know why? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3635.96s)]
*  Because that's all we need. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3636.96s)]
*  You know why we have all these commands? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3639.74s)]
*  This all emerged as a result of the Second World War? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3641.18s)]
*  Because you needed layered commands over distance to communicate. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3644.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3648.54s)]
*  If you take a drive out to Kansas, one of my favorite states, and I was stationed at [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3649.54s)]
*  both Leavenworth and Fort Riley, why is Fort Riley where it is from Fort Leavenworth? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3654.38s)]
*  Because it takes exactly one day on horseback to ride from Fort Leavenworth to Fort Riley. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3661.54s)]
*  And that was important 130, 140 years ago because you had Arapahos and Comanches and [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3668.06s)]
*  other people that could interfere with you. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3674.98s)]
*  So you had to be able to get somewhere to reinforce or support someone else. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3677.22s)]
*  That's gone. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3681.8999999999996s)]
*  We don't have to do that now. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3682.8999999999996s)]
*  You can have instantaneous communications almost anywhere in the world if you want it [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3684.46s)]
*  immediately. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3688.54s)]
*  You can have visibility of everything thanks to the satellite arrays that we have of everything. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3690.4199999999996s)]
*  You don't have to have commands for every region in the world. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3695.8199999999997s)]
*  And we don't have to strive for global military hegemony. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3699.54s)]
*  What we need to do is be resolute in the defense of our country here in the Western [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3704.1s)]
*  Hemisphere. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3709.5s)]
*  So those four commands make sense. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3710.5s)]
*  They make sense because we are also primarily a maritime and an aerospace power. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3713.14s)]
*  We're not a land power except in the United States. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3718.1s)]
*  And that's why the United States Army for over 100 years was always on the Mexican border. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3722.2799999999997s)]
*  Because that's where the hotspots were. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3728.42s)]
*  We forget that Mexico was the one that the Germans approached in 1917 as a potential [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3730.46s)]
*  ally against us and the Mexicans were only too happy. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3736.62s)]
*  After they left, you got the communists and they moved into Mexico. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3740.2200000000003s)]
*  And the Mexicans were very pro-communist all up through the Second World War and beyond. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3745.3s)]
*  The largest KGB operation in North America was in Mexico. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3750.8s)]
*  Of course, León Trotsky lived in Mexico City. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3754.9s)]
*  Of course, our friend Castro and Che Guevara. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3759.18s)]
*  Che was always special to me. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3762.3399999999997s)]
*  He's a Bosque. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3764.02s)]
*  But that's another story. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3765.14s)]
*  Anyway, the point is, you know, good Lord, what are we doing? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3766.14s)]
*  We should be concerned about Mexico. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3771.22s)]
*  It's a permanent issue for us. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3774.74s)]
*  It's as important to us as Ukraine is to Russia. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3777.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3780.7799999999997s)]
*  So let me ask you a last question in an area that I know you know a lot about, Germany. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3781.7799999999997s)]
*  So I thought you were going to be the ambassador of Germany. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3787.86s)]
*  I think I should have been. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3792.5s)]
*  I know. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3793.5s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3794.5s)]
*  Back to ours with fat chance. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3795.5s)]
*  Sorry to bring up a sore subject. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3796.5s)]
*  But the reason that Germany matters, I mean, there are many reasons it matters, but it [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3799.26s)]
*  is basically it's Europe and without Germany, it's kind of hard to be Europe except as like [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3802.54s)]
*  some sad museum. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3807.1600000000003s)]
*  It's the only really living part of Europe and it seems to be dying. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3808.9s)]
*  What happens to Germany? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3813.38s)]
*  It's going to depend a great deal on the emergence of real leadership in Germany that [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3816.46s)]
*  is clear eyed and focused on what's important to Germany. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3820.66s)]
*  I think the last time they had that kind of capable leadership was really with Bismarck. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3825.78s)]
*  I think Wilhelm I was a good man, but he wasn't strong enough to resist the dumb ideas that [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3831.54s)]
*  came his way. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3837.82s)]
*  And Hitler obviously overreached and destroyed everything, put everything at risk. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3839.5s)]
*  I don't see any evidence that the Germans are interested in overreaching or conquering [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3844.18s)]
*  anybody, but they do have an interest in restoring their productivity, their scientific industrial [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3848.22s)]
*  base. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3853.66s)]
*  They've thrown the baby out with the bathwater. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3854.9s)]
*  You know, when I went to school over there and I went to a good school and I was at a [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3857.54s)]
*  good school in the United States, I was the oldest Quaker private school in the United [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3861.58s)]
*  States founded in 1681, the same year that my maternal ancestors arrived in the United [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3866.06s)]
*  States. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3871.2999999999997s)]
*  And I was sent there because my maternal ancestors were all Quakers and many of them had gone [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3872.7s)]
*  through all these friends school systems, very good. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3876.98s)]
*  And I went from that school for one year to Germany, to Braunschweig in northern central [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3880.3399999999997s)]
*  Germany. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3886.7799999999997s)]
*  We call it Brunswick in English, Braunschweig. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3888.02s)]
*  And I went back to see the school in 2015 and I saw it in 2011 briefly and then again [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3892.8199999999997s)]
*  in 2015. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3897.7s)]
*  It was all male and when I got into the 11th grade, they were studying differential calculus [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3899.46s)]
*  and preparing to move into integral calculus. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3906.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, that was a bit advanced for me. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3908.9399999999996s)]
*  You know, I'd gone through algebra and trigonometry and so forth, but differential and integral [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3911.66s)]
*  calculus in the 11th grade, this was a real problem. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3917.5s)]
*  And I struggled mightily. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3921.68s)]
*  And this was a school with 13 grades. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3923.98s)]
*  And by the time you finished, if you completed your Abitur, you were qualified to go to any [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3927.1s)]
*  university in the country. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3932.64s)]
*  You were stamped. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3934.54s)]
*  You got the stamp of approval. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3935.54s)]
*  They did look at your performance on your final exams. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3937.14s)]
*  But this was very, very rigorous. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3939.98s)]
*  I mean, I was dealing with classmates who were on the humanities side. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3941.42s)]
*  I was stuck on the math science side, which is the wrong place for me at the time. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3944.7799999999997s)]
*  But you know, I survived. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3949.98s)]
*  Lots of beer. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3951.82s)]
*  Anyway, on the other side, they were studying Greek and Latin, along with French and English. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3952.82s)]
*  It was very rigorous. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3962.6200000000003s)]
*  This was a university prep school because the Germans had a system where at the 5th [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3963.84s)]
*  grade and the 9th grade, people were separated and were sent off to what we would call trade [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3969.2200000000003s)]
*  schools. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3976.34s)]
*  You could learn to be a hotel manager. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3977.34s)]
*  You could learn to be any number of different trades or whatever skills were needed, from [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3979.18s)]
*  electrician to plumber or something else. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3983.3399999999997s)]
*  Only about 15% went through this university prep system, which was designed to send you [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3985.7799999999997s)]
*  to a university where you would go on to do great things. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3991.7799999999997s)]
*  So I got back there and we were all male. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3995.54s)]
*  And the first thing that I saw on the first day, I came in there and everybody was fairly [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=3998.8999999999996s)]
*  nice to me. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4002.94s)]
*  They thought I was strange and I thought they were strange, but you know, whatever. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4003.94s)]
*  Germans were different, you know? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4006.94s)]
*  I said, geez, these Germans are very different. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4008.34s)]
*  And they gave me a seat, told me where to sit. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4011.58s)]
*  And the instructor walked into the classroom and the instructor said, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4014.54s)]
*  Guten Morgen meine Herrschaften. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4018.42s)]
*  And everybody stood up at attention. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4020.54s)]
*  He said, Guten Morgen Herr Studienrat. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4022.02s)]
*  And he would say, Bitte meine Herren, setzen Sie sich. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4025.7400000000002s)]
*  And we all sat down. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4029.2200000000003s)]
*  Let me tell you what happened after that was serious. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4030.9s)]
*  We sat down and we focused nonstop for an hour, hour and 20 minutes on whatever the [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4034.84s)]
*  subject matter was. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4041.88s)]
*  And the instructor was very well trained, very well educated. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4043.88s)]
*  And he would turn around and he would say to one of the students at the top of the class [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4046.36s)]
*  in the front row, I sort of sat in the back, and this guy was the individual that recorded [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4050.6000000000004s)]
*  whatever was taught in the class that day. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4058.04s)]
*  And he would say, what did we discuss the last time? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4060.96s)]
*  And he would open the book and he said, the last time we discussed the following things. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4063.6800000000003s)]
*  And he said, exactly, this time we are going to do the following. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4068.08s)]
*  Let me tell you, it was one of the best educations I've ever gotten in my life. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4071.96s)]
*  But what really struck me was focus. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4076.12s)]
*  School was not about anything else other than infusing minds with understanding and knowledge. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4080.12s)]
*  It was very effective. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4089.2000000000003s)]
*  So when I went back in 2015, I looked around, suddenly there were all these girls. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4091.28s)]
*  There were no women with us. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4097.72s)]
*  We were all male. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4098.72s)]
*  Suddenly we have all these girls in the hallways. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4099.72s)]
*  And I peeked in and I saw and the teacher walked in and said, okay, students, please [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4103.0s)]
*  take your seats and we'll get going. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4108.0s)]
*  And I was shocked. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4111.2s)]
*  So I spoke to the man who ran the school and said, oh, we've adopted the American model. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4112.8s)]
*  You've done everything that you do in America now. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4119.36s)]
*  I said, you've lost your mind. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4122.44s)]
*  Just like lowered the standards dramatically. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4125.2s)]
*  What you had here worked. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4126.839999999999s)]
*  It was brilliant. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4129.24s)]
*  And I was so grateful that I was exposed to it. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4130.92s)]
*  And you've ruined it. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4134.04s)]
*  Of course, they said, well, this man's a Neanderthal. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4135.04s)]
*  He's an idiot. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4138.24s)]
*  He doesn't understand what he's talking about. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4139.24s)]
*  Germany has to get back to basics. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4142.839999999999s)]
*  Go back to being German. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4145.759999999999s)]
*  Stop apologizing for being German. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4147.68s)]
*  Do what Germans do best. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4150.12s)]
*  I'm not saying Germans are perfect, but every nationality in Europe has a certain area of [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4151.6s)]
*  expertise, a certain specialty that they do very, very well. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4158.72s)]
*  The Germans need to get back to that and stop apologizing for events that happened long [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4163.320000000001s)]
*  before any of these people were born. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4168.200000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean that you're denying something that happened. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4170.200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4174.64s)]
*  No one denies anything in Germany. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4175.8s)]
*  In fact, when they started showing these Nazi symbols in Ukraine, people in Germany were [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4178.400000000001s)]
*  horrified saying, my God, what is going on in that country? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4184.52s)]
*  And they should have been horrified. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4189.68s)]
*  We should have been horrified. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4191.06s)]
*  And we weren't. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4193.24s)]
*  We subsidized it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4194.68s)]
*  We pushed it. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4195.76s)]
*  Well, some Nazis are okay as long as they're doing the bidding of the CIA and the Biden [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4196.76s)]
*  administration, as long as Toria Nuland thinks they're okay. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4202.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, I don't subscribe to that view. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4207.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm pretty anti-Nazi across the board. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4210.4800000000005s)]
*  And there's so many good things about Germany that that's the last thing in the world you [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4214.16s)]
*  want to resurrect. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4217.22s)]
*  And I think that will happen. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4219.2s)]
*  But it's not going to happen under Metz. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4221.24s)]
*  He's another semi-globalist with connections to BlackRock and others. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4224.0s)]
*  He's going to stagger forward and eventually the Germans will get rid of him. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4228.5s)]
*  And eventually, I think the AFD will come to power. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4233.08s)]
*  In fact, they've done the AFD a great favor by refusing to cooperate with them because [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4236.5599999999995s)]
*  that will draw more people into the AFD so that when they do get power, they will have [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4241.44s)]
*  an ironclad majority and they can do the things that are needed to save Germany. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4246.639999999999s)]
*  So you don't think Germany's dead? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4251.879999999999s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4255.5599999999995s)]
*  No one in Europe is dead. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4257.0s)]
*  Nobody in Europe is dead. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4259.4s)]
*  Even the Brits? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4261.6s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4262.6s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4263.6s)]
*  They're so degraded. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4264.6s)]
*  It just breaks my heart. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4265.6s)]
*  You know, listen, I think if you spend time over there, I think you'll find there's a [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4268.2s)]
*  lot left. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4274.16s)]
*  I do talk to people on the phone. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4275.16s)]
*  I have done some podcasts with Englishmen and Scotsmen and so forth. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4276.64s)]
*  But they have been through this systematic brainwashing to be turned into self-loathing [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4282.48s)]
*  Europeans. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4287.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4288.56s)]
*  Apologizing for things they never did and that they shouldn't apologize for. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4290.080000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4293.96s)]
*  I mean, this is just crazy. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4294.96s)]
*  It's like saying, you're evil. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4296.76s)]
*  You were in the Second Cavalry, MacGregor, and you know what they did to the Indians? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4298.4800000000005s)]
*  Come on. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4302.68s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4303.68s)]
*  I'm sure it was terrible and I'm sorry we did that and it's regrettable. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4306.8s)]
*  But I wasn't there and I'm not going to compensate anybody for anything. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4310.76s)]
*  My grandfather used to say, none of us is responsible for the people our parents slept [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4316.2s)]
*  with. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4320.36s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4321.36s)]
*  To hell with that. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4322.36s)]
*  No, we don't believe in collective punishment here in the Christian West. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4323.36s)]
*  Doug McGregor, thank you for your bracing but very insightful analysis. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4327.5599999999995s)]
*  Good to see you again, Tucker. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4334.76s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4335.76s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4340.76s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4344.36s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4346.0s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4347.0s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, all the change taking place in [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4348.4s)]
*  our economy and our politics, with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, Google [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4351.8s)]
*  has decided you should have less information rather than more. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4357.08s)]
*  That is totally wrong. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4361.4s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4363.36s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4364.719999999999s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4365.96s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4367.639999999999s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4368.639999999999s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4369.639999999999s)]
*  true, not intentionally deceptive. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4373.52s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4376.120000000001s)]
*  Subscribe. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4380.0s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4381.0s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4385.14s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbd6HAziaE&t=4389.8s)]
