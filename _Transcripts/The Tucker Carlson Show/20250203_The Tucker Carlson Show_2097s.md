*  You have the best job. I'm not kidding you when we first paid him [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=24.6s)]
*  I think he wanted twenty five thousand and three goats [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=28.84s)]
*  Did you come up with a male or female? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=33.04s)]
*  Goats? Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know the answer to that question, but he got twenty five thousand and three goats [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=35.36s)]
*  That was the first [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=40.64s)]
*  Yeah, dumpling from Siberia the guy who got me into this became the world champion here in Saudi Arabia [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=42.36s)]
*  I [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=53.84s)]
*  Think it seems more painful than getting punched. I don't know about that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=68.84s)]
*  When you what you're gonna watch tonight, listen, you take a minimum of three slaps and slap [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=73.44s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna see shins to the face elbows. It's pretty big slams. Yeah [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=78.2s)]

*  No, you're right. Yeah, or an elbow. I [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=87.04s)]
*  Saw you two weeks ago on stage at the inauguration. What was that like? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=90.0s)]

*  Like me you have a great relationship with this guy and yeah see him [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=98.2s)]
*  To be this far away when he was taking his oath. How cool is that? I mean it was it was awesome [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  So I think you I think you've known him better than almost almost anyone around him for longer [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=109.28s)]
*  He and I are very close [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=115.84s)]
*  I know and have been for a long time and that became pretty obvious late in the campaign when even though you're not political you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=117.08s)]
*  Wound up kind of associated with Trump's cuz you know him so well [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=122.34s)]
*  Do you think he's changed in the line since July when he got shot? Do you notice a change for the better? Yeah [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=125.32s)]
*  Yeah, how yeah, I think that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=132.12s)]
*  Listen at the end of the day [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=135.38s)]
*  Has Brazilian and as tough as this guy is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=137.62s)]
*  you know when you almost get assassinated the way that he was I think it messes with you a little bit and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=141.62s)]
*  the thing about him is I [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=148.98s)]
*  Talked to him. I was flying to Italy when he was shot at [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=151.62s)]
*  and I called him as soon as I landed and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=155.82s)]
*  He had just got home from the hospital and he seemed [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=159.62s)]
*  Unfazed yes, which is it's just not even it's not humanly possible, but he did but then after [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=164.02s)]
*  after that he flew the next day to the RNC in Milwaukee and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  Literally never [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=177.62s)]
*  Never rested never took a break never stayed out of the limelight after almost getting shot, and I don't know I just felt like it [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=179.74s)]
*  for him it affected him, but he [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=188.38s)]
*  Made a complete recovery from that thing he did I talked to him also that night and he seemed totally unaffected [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=192.7s)]
*  But how could you be totally unaffected? Do you think there were? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=199.1s)]
*  Long-term constantly good consequences. I mean he went on to be more successful than he's ever been [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=202.66s)]
*  Right just it's just a testament to his toughness his resilience his grittiness and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=208.14s)]
*  I think this is what I truly believe I think that to his core [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  He believes that God spared him [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=219.94s)]
*  To to to run this country for the next four years, and I think that had a lot to do with his mentality [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=222.86s)]
*  Coming out of that you know [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=229.38s)]
*  Assassination attempt because he does seem calmer. He certainly seems more decisive and in command. I mean that's just from watching it really I'm [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=232.02s)]
*  Tucker I went to Mar-a-Lago to be with him election night [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=241.1s)]
*  He hadn't slept in like 72 hours, then he wins the election I jump on a plane I flew to flew to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=246.06s)]
*  Las Vegas and picked up my wife, and then I flew to Hawaii and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=253.98s)]
*  The guy's calling me the next I mean [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=258.42s)]
*  The guy doesn't sleep [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=261.3s)]

*  That's besides the point [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=411.18s)]
*  That was incredible the last press conference when he was out there [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=412.74s)]
*  It was like people were climbing over each other and he gets right in there fires away and answers questions and you know [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=415.48s)]
*  He's incredible. There's there's there's nothing like this guy what I mean it seems how much he's done [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=423.42s)]
*  Yeah, a lot short amount of time that he's been there, so where's the opposition to him? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=428.22s)]
*  It seems like all of a sudden, you know, we spent eight years [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=431.84s)]
*  Hearing that, you know, he's evil tyrant who's gonna suspend the Constitution and enslave the nation and then he wins and you don't there's like [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=435.35999999999996s)]

*  It's like I love hearing everybody's opinion [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=468.6s)]
*  They are nuts. It's it's like I can't even listen to them. They're so it's almost like a comic strip [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=471.40000000000003s)]
*  Like it's a it's a cartoon that network. It's it's like a cartoon. It's so bad [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=476.92s)]
*  It's unbelievable and and and it's the whole if Trump says it's blue [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  They say it's black if it's you know, it's just it's it's so bad. But yeah, no [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=486.58s)]

*  Arguing about anything anymore. It's it's it's dead. It's all gone. Actually [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=505.14s)]
*  The exact opposite the people that I know that were very liberal [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=509.9s)]
*  They're not very right, but they're definitely not very left I know right and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=514.68s)]
*  Everyone seems to have accepted free speech as the status quo now. Like you think so you've been sticking with that for or well [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=520.58s)]
*  Through the middle of all of this famously, but now people like yeah, okay, you know, I disagree but you get to say what you think [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=528.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, does it feel that way? Yeah, it boy needs to be that way. You can never let that go you let that go and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=534.12s)]
*  We're all in big trouble man, so but I feel like I also felt like after the election [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=541.12s)]
*  There was a sigh of relief and not just in the United States, but all over the world here [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=546.88s)]
*  And other countries that we go to it's just everybody is [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=553.08s)]
*  Celebrating the fact that Trump won the election on both sides of the conflict [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=557.32s)]
*  I agree in Israel and the Arab countries both. Yeah people were happy great at the power slap event the other night [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=560.8s)]
*  You know their fans here and I was talking to people and taking pictures and stuff and people were saying to me you have to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=568.06s)]
*  Tell Trump to stop this war Trump has to stop this war, you know [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=574.7399999999999s)]

*  I hope you will and in Russia and Ukraine. I think the Russians and the Ukrainians maybe not Zelensky [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=582.4599999999999s)]
*  But I think most Ukrainians I've never met Ukrainian. It's not for Trump. I've never met a Russian. It's not for Trump [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=586.8599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's just interesting could not agree with you because they think that I mean you've got fighters from all over the world [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=591.8599999999999s)]
*  Yep [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=596.6199999999999s)]
*  And the farther away they are from the United States the more they are for Trump [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=597.74s)]
*  Well, did you ever notice that every time I have Trump at a at a UFC event every fighter walks over to him and you know [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=600.28s)]
*  pays respect to him and all the fighters love him from all over the world and and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=606.74s)]
*  That's it's been [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=612.0600000000001s)]
*  It's been a huge sigh of relief since the election [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=613.7s)]
*  Anyone who's knowledgeable about physical health would tell you that sleep is absolutely essential [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=617.18s)]
*  And here's a good way to get a better sleep. It's called cozy earth [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=622.02s)]
*  We use them they make bamboo sheets. That sounds a little bit weird [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=626.5s)]
*  Try it. It's one of those things. It's so weird. It's likely to be great. And in fact, it is great [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=631.62s)]
*  They are soft smooth breathable after a long day slipping into cozy earth. Bamboo sheets is a deep pleasure [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=637.1800000000001s)]
*  But it's not all that they sell cozy earth has a long lineup bedding joggers pajamas [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=646.3000000000001s)]
*  Lots of different ways to be comfortable in bamboo. It's very cool [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=652.4200000000001s)]
*  Valentine's Day is coming up. It's a perfect time to try it buy it for someone you love [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=656.22s)]
*  You get a hundred night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=660.58s)]
*  You can roll around on cozy earth's bamboo sheets for a decade and it's backed up from the company [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=665.62s)]
*  And if you use the code Tucker you get up to 40% off on your purchase you go to cozy earth comm use the code Tucker [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=672.66s)]
*  Don't forget if asked in a post purchase survey [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=680.34s)]
*  Let him know you heard about cozy earth from us [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=683.3399999999999s)]
*  They're great. So the biggest change I haven't talked to Mark Zuckerberg in a while [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=687.18s)]
*  Then all of a sudden I see him. He looks completely different [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=693.8599999999999s)]
*  He puts you on the meta board and he's like he seems like a Trump guy. I think what is that? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=696.74s)]
*  I think what you saw not just Zuckerberg. I think you see all the guys from Silicon Valley now that are you know, um [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=702.38s)]

*  inauguration and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=713.9s)]
*  Creating a relationship with him. I feel like a lot of these people were [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=715.26s)]
*  During the the woke nutty madness that we went through, you know, I guess I would call it during the kovat era [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=720.54s)]
*  And a little before that [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=728.6999999999999s)]
*  Are also relieved that it's over and I think a lot of people [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=731.66s)]
*  It was a very few people there was a handful of people that actually stood up against this and and and weren't afraid [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=736.8599999999999s)]
*  to [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=743.6999999999999s)]

*  a lot of people got cancelled a lot of bad things happened to a lot of good people during that that that time and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=749.3399999999999s)]
*  But there was a handful of people that stood up to it and I think everybody's relieved that it's over [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=756.2199999999999s)]
*  Are you concerned that at your next meet a meta meeting you'll lock eyes with Mark Zuckerberg and he will steal your soul [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=761.2199999999999s)]
*  No, I like that alien vibe at all I actually like more no listen if I felt that way about Zuckerberg [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=768.46s)]
*  I would have never been on the board. I would have never so [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=774.26s)]
*  My my head of PR actually hit me up one day and says hey Mark Zuckerberg's looking for your number [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=777.62s)]
*  Can I give it to him? And I said yeah, of course, so he called me and he said [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=783.02s)]

*  Elon versus Mark Zuckerberg fight thing that was that was going on at that time [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=854.54s)]

*  The Coliseum was gonna let us do that fight there and then eventually it you know, it started to fall apart [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=891.2399999999999s)]
*  But while it lasted it was fun and through that Mark and I became even closer and then I [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=898.3199999999999s)]

*  That's that's the the the beginning up until today of my relationship with Mark and and you know, I [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=959.64s)]
*  Know a lot of people think my sister my sister is as far right my sister's like you as far right as you could possibly [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=968.16s)]

*  But I'm just telling you my relationship is not far right [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=999.72s)]

*  She's you know, she didn't love it and you know, but I said [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1008.84s)]
*  Listen Mark Zuckerberg isn't isn't what everybody thinks he is. He's not as bad as everybody thinks he is [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1014.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, I do think it was I mean [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1021.58s)]
*  We're just watching it from afar not talking you about it [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1025.5s)]
*  But I thought the one thing that everyone knows about you is you're opposed to censorship [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1028.22s)]
*  You're clearly I mean again this week you had you came out and you said one of your fighters is something you thought was disgusting [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1031.8600000000001s)]
*  And you hated but you're not firing him like you've kind of taken a stand [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1036.7s)]
*  Again censorship very publicly again and again and again [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1040.1399999999999s)]
*  You know Facebook is known for censorship [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1044.6999999999998s)]
*  So probably a good thing they're putting you on the board like what's gonna happen when you're sitting in me [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1046.58s)]
*  You know, like we need to censor stuff. We disagree with I think that's why I'm there [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1050.62s)]

*  I don't care. I don't care if you like it and care if you don't like it [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1180.78s)]
*  This is my company and I'll run it the way I want to right [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1183.62s)]
*  So when you say, you know, your role at Facebook and you say Zuckerberg said to you I need spine on my board [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1186.46s)]
*  Do you feel like your role is to oppose censorship at Facebook? I know I don't think that my role is to oppose censorship [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1193.5s)]
*  I think that there's gonna be decisions that need to be made on the fly. It's already happened [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1199.46s)]
*  I mean, I've already been involved in and and a few things already [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1205.46s)]
*  In just a short time that I've been there and I give my opinion [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1210.42s)]
*  on [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1216.42s)]
*  What I think should be done and how it should be handled everybody that I've met on the on the board already [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1217.46s)]
*  They're all actually really good people and smart people and and we've all had [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1223.8600000000001s)]
*  Really good interaction so far [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1227.54s)]
*  so [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1230.1s)]
*  I'm actually really I'm really liking it. It's gonna be my first board meeting. It's a two-day thing [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1231.22s)]
*  I don't know how long we're gonna sit in there in the in these board meetings, but [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1236.18s)]
*  That'll be different new for me a new experience for me [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1239.7s)]
*  But my interaction with all the other board members has been really really good so far [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1242.58s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to it and and I think that when I can add value [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1247.54s)]
*  I will speak up and and and [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1252.8999999999999s)]
*  I will speak up and and and and at the end of the day mark zuckerberg runs meta [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1254.9s)]
*  Yeah, and he'll make the final decisions. I think uh, it's brilliant in the way that he brings people in that he likes and respects and [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1259.94s)]
*  Wants to hear from and everybody gives their opinion and at the end of the day mark zuckerberg makes the decisions [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1267.8600000000001s)]
*  So the whole point of market capitalism is consumer choice [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1274.02s)]
*  You have a choice between products and services and the competition between companies [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1278.9s)]
*  Makes the goods and services better. That's the core idea [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1285.0600000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately, there are an awful lot of monopolies out there monopolies are not good for consumers [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  They are not good for you [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1294.02s)]
*  And one of the places where there's effectively a monopoly is in wireless contracts, but it's not a complete monopoly [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1295.94s)]
*  You're probably paying way too much to use your cell phone [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1301.8600000000001s)]
*  But now you have a choice. You don't have to pay a hundred bucks a month just to get a free phone [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1306.42s)]
*  That's not a good deal [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1311.0600000000002s)]
*  There's a company called pure talk which we use [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1312.42s)]
*  That has no inflated prices with a qualifying plan of just 45 dollars a month [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1314.98s)]
*  You can choose a free phone an iphone 14 or a samsung gallery [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1319.7s)]
*  Then you get unlimited talk tax 25 gigs of data, which is enough for most people a mobile hotspot [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1323.94s)]
*  All for that low price and it's got the most dependable 5g now work [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1330.5s)]
*  So you get your free iphone 14 or samsung galaxy by visiting pure talk.com slash tucker and you switch to pure talk today [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1334.98s)]
*  America's wireless company pure talk. Do you think that? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1342.02s)]
*  We're at peak openness right now for the internet. It feels like yeah [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1346.42s)]
*  People have more freedom to say what they really think than i've ever seen. Can that last? Well, I think [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1350.82s)]
*  That's a good question. You know, one of the things that i've learned in my short time at meta [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1357.3s)]
*  Is the far right think they're being suppressed [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1361.7s)]
*  the far left think that uh [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1364.26s)]
*  it's too dangerous and not being policed enough and [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1366.5s)]
*  The only place where there is true free speech is in america and the rest of the world extorts them every day [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1369.3s)]
*  That's what i've learned in my short extorts them. What do you mean extorts them? So if you are in [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1375.78s)]
*  some country [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1381.14s)]
*  That whatever country that has uh, you know [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1382.42s)]
*  Facebook or instagram or whatever it is and something gets posted and stays up that they don't like they'll find them [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1385.78s)]
*  Um, you know all kinds of crazy threatened to shut them down [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1393.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's constant constant daily [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1396.58s)]
*  Yeah, well it has political effect. I mean, yeah, there's no doubt those companies very powerful [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1400.6599999999999s)]
*  They can bring down governments very powerful and probably have unwittingly or not [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1404.8999999999999s)]
*  They are so when you think about um, facebook instagram x [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1409.78s)]
*  Um, etc, etc. I mean, this is the new media. This is these are [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1414.6599999999999s)]
*  The fox the abc's the nbc's, you know of the future this this is [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1419.2199999999998s)]
*  Like owning um a major network or the new york times or you know [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1424.5800000000002s)]
*  More more more powerful than that. I agree. Yeah. Yeah [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1429.94s)]
*  um [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1433.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's like television plus newspapers because it has the emotional resonance [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1434.5s)]
*  And the full penetration like everywhere in the world people are looking at this stuff [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1439.22s)]
*  So and it's immediate as soon as something comes out the whole world knows instantly, right? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1443.3s)]
*  So it's not surprising that country x every other country basically other than the united states is going to be [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1448.9s)]
*  Pushing meta and google and elon at x to you know tailor this or that according to their demands [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1455.38s)]
*  But the united states is based on the idea that citizens get to say what they think period [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1461.94s)]
*  It's the first point in the bill of rights. So [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1466.8200000000002s)]
*  What matters is they stay firm here and do you think they will [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1470.66s)]
*  I think they will for the next four years. I think they will for the next four years [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1474.18s)]
*  I think you see them all except for elon. I mean, let's be honest [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1477.38s)]
*  Elon was a superhero through this whole that's for sure. Yeah, you know what I mean? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1481.38s)]
*  Where are we right now without elon musk? It's [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1485.46s)]
*  What he did was incredible and what do you think he did it? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1489.22s)]
*  Because I think he's smart and I think he's uh, I think that uh [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1494.3400000000001s)]
*  Something about him is that he's a great guy [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1499.22s)]
*  Something about him is fearless the fact that he would go in [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1502.5800000000002s)]
*  And spend the kind of money that he did to uh to buy that thing basically just to find out what went on [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1506.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, he is literally a superhero in this country right now as far as i'm concerned [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1513.38s)]
*  and um [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1519.06s)]
*  I think what he did also made a lot of people [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1520.9s)]
*  in that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1524.3400000000001s)]
*  Field I guess i'd say [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1525.6200000000001s)]
*  Braver and say you know what this we should follow [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1527.6200000000001s)]
*  His lead and uh, then obviously having this administration [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1530.8200000000002s)]
*  There's nothing worse than when the government comes after you when when we were when the obama administration was in they came after us for being a monopoly [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1535.06s)]
*  So we bought this company [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1542.98s)]
*  That was bankrupt [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1544.74s)]
*  turning around [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1546.5s)]
*  Creating jobs and all these other things and we got the government we had to spend like eight or nine million dollars at that time [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1548.18s)]
*  To defend ourselves against a monopoly suit from the government. Meanwhile, google actually is a monopoly [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1553.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's a lot of monopolies. There are a lot of monopolies exactly, you know, um, but yeah, so [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1558.98s)]
*  You know whenever you have [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1565.14s)]
*  The government coming after you it's it's it's not fun. So what'd you tell your i'm sorry? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1567.38s)]
*  Mist what'd you tell your sister? She complains from the far right [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1572.42s)]
*  What was that when you said your sister complained about you joining the board? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1576.1000000000001s)]
*  You I forgot to ask you how you responded to it. What did you say to her? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1579.7s)]
*  yeah, well I told her the same thing that I just told you about how I felt about mark and and uh, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1582.8200000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. Would you rather not have [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1588.5800000000002s)]
*  meta and mark zuckerberg and everybody on on on [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1591.94s)]
*  our side, I mean [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1596.18s)]
*  And by by our side, I'd rather have you influencing them. I think that's good by our side [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1598.02s)]
*  I mean the side of common sense. I agree. I totally agree the side of common sense [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1603.54s)]
*  You want the zuckerbergs of the world and the googles and the apples and you know the elon musk you want? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1607.7s)]
*  As many allies on the side of common sense as possible [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1614.5800000000002s)]
*  you don't want to [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1618.5800000000002s)]
*  distance yourself from these guys you want to embrace them and and and try to uh [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1620.18s)]
*  Try to figure out how to bring everybody into the common sense world, right? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1625.14s)]
*  I mean, isn't that what we all want? Why why fight and battle and say I would never sit on the board of [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1629.14s)]
*  meta or whatever if if he thinks that I [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1634.66s)]
*  Can add any value? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1638.18s)]
*  Why would I not do it and i'm very into social media and I think it's the future and [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1640.1000000000001s)]
*  Obviously ai is too and I get to [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1645.6200000000001s)]
*  get inside [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1648.66s)]
*  And and and see and learn the future of this thing and have and have a hand and how it all plays out [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1650.3400000000001s)]
*  Why would I not want to do that? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1656.42s)]
*  I think that's fair. I think that's fair. So what I mean you say that for the next four years [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1658.26s)]
*  Social media in this country following the lead of elon is likely to be open and free and less crazy more common sense oriented [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1664.98s)]
*  Less woke, etc. What about the other professional sports leagues like nfl [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1670.74s)]
*  nba do they swing back in [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1676.02s)]
*  To the center of america or they continue on this self-destructive path. I don't know. That's a good question. That's a good question [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1679.14s)]
*  That's one I can't answer. I what I do is [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1685.46s)]
*  I run mine [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1689.3s)]
*  The way I think it should and again, I I run it [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1692.02s)]
*  With what I call common sense [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1696.1s)]
*  I that's worked for you. So why wouldn't they try that? Well, I mean [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1698.5s)]
*  It's hard to say that the nfl is screwing up. I mean the the nfl is as powerful as powerful could be the nba [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1702.1s)]
*  Ratings are dropping, you know [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=1708.74s)]

*  But on another level it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right now all the change taking place in our economy [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=2052.1s)]

*  We're not in charge of google or we could find a way around it a way that you could actually get information that is true [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=2074.18s)]
*  Not intentionally deceptive the way to do that on youtube. We think it's to subscribe to our channel subscribe [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3V3sbludo&t=2079.8599999999997s)]
