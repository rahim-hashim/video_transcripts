**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E)
*  But weren't you surprised at Jim Gaffigan going after the Democrats at the L. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=0.0s)]
*  Smith dinner? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4.34s)]
*  Cause he's got Trump derangement syndrome and I couldn't believe the shit he was [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5.24s)]
*  saying. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=8.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=9.38s)]
*  You remember? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=10.06s)]
*  Did you remember the jokes he did? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  He goes, the, the media and the Democrats say that democracy's on the ballot and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  they have to protect it and they had to protect it so much they did a coup. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=16.86s)]
*  I was like, fuck it, Jim Gaffigan. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=21.7s)]
*  And he's not for Trump. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=25.02s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=26.22s)]
*  He's Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=26.82s)]
*  In fact, I used to, you know, kind of sub, I, so I know him and, um, he never would [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  talk about politics because he wants to have the biggest audience. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=35.68s)]
*  And then, but Trump, he can't, I can't whole bite my tongue. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=38.44s)]
*  I've got to say something, you know? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  And I was like, you know, the time to say something was when Barack Obama was ruling [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=43.839999999999996s)]
*  as a neocon, a tool of wall street. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=48.32s)]
*  And, and, uh, that's what made workers desperate enough to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=51.72s)]
*  That's when you should have said something when the democratic party stopped being [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=56.84s)]
*  Democrats and, but now you're going to say something, you're, you're, you're [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=60.5s)]
*  upset at the, at the symptom instead of the disease. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=63.78s)]
*  At the result of what you allowed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=68.06s)]
*  So that was actually something I thought a lot about last night at the fascist rally. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=86.84s)]
*  Um, it was so huge. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=91.04s)]
*  And I know, you know, Trump is always talking about his crowd size and, you [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  know, there's a debate about it, but last night there was no debate. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was, it was crazy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  It just, midtown was just like a mass of people. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=103.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=106.44s)]
*  It was like Times Square in New York. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=106.72s)]
*  Yeah, I was there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=108.4s)]
*  I was in, I was in Manhattan yesterday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=109.76s)]
*  I saw it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=111.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=111.84s)]
*  I was in, I was in Manhattan yesterday. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=112.24s)]
*  I saw it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=113.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=114.24s)]
*  I was on my way to a, uh, some kind of peace rally or something in the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=114.4s)]
*  valley hosted by Scott Ritter. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=119.2s)]
*  Oh, Judge Napolitano was there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=121.84s)]
*  Oh, I love Judge Napolitano. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=124.16s)]
*  So the crowd was just so overwhelming yesterday that, um, I did ask myself, like, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=126.4s)]
*  I think Trump's going to win just objectively. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=133.32s)]
*  I want him to win, but, but I think he's going to win. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=135.9s)]
*  But then I thought if I were the Democrats, I would, I would pause and ask, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=138.42s)]
*  like, what is this? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=142.98s)]
*  It's not just that, you know, half the country's evil. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=143.98s)]
*  Maybe there's more to it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=146.94s)]
*  Does anyone ever stop? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=148.02s)]
*  I mean, I try and understand why do people love Obama? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=149.06s)]
*  Why do they love Biden? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=151.38s)]
*  I mean, I do try to wonder, I mean, I think you should, they're Americans, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=152.3s)]
*  I understand why people liked Obama or loved him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=155.42s)]
*  Me too. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=158.26s)]
*  He made them, when he's, he made me feel good when he spoke, you know, even [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=158.62s)]
*  though I was aware of the things he was doing when he gave his speech, I'm like, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=162.42s)]
*  I feel a little bit better. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=165.94s)]
*  You know, he was 100% and every American's like, you know, slavery really was bad. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=167.5s)]
*  And, you know, there are the disparities between black and white in here, like [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=171.73999999999998s)]
*  all these white people voted for a black president, maybe we're going to move [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  beyond that and maybe we could stop talking about race and start talking about [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=178.94s)]
*  economics. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=181.42s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=182.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  That's what I thought just personally, not that I'm a race guild guy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=183.1s)]
*  I'm not, but I would like to have a conversation about something real, like [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  economics and war. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=189.62s)]
*  That's exactly where I'm at. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=191.45999999999998s)]
*  And that's, uh, so I had this guy on, uh, Michael Perranti, son, Christian [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=192.78s)]
*  Perranti wrote this paper recently and it was about the birth of wokeness. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=196.78s)]
*  Like some people think, you know, it started, you know, five minutes ago. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=201.86s)]
*  Some people think it started 20 years ago. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=205.02s)]
*  He said started after world war two and it was the completion or the coming [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=207.38s)]
*  together of the NGOs, like the Rockefeller foundation, Ford foundation [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=212.26s)]
*  with the intelligence community and what they did, like they didn't have a problem [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=217.14s)]
*  when Martin Luther King wanted to integrate lunch counters because, uh, that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=220.98s)]
*  didn't cost them anything, you know? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=224.7s)]
*  Uh, but when he's shifted against the Vietnam war and then he did a poor [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=226.38s)]
*  people's march on Washington DC, he didn't do a black people's march. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=230.98s)]
*  He did a poor people's march. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=236.61999999999998s)]
*  And that's, and of course, you know, they killed him when he was supporting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=238.26s)]
*  a sanitation strike, right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  So it was the economics. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=243.26s)]
*  And so they, they, it's been the goal of the, the NGOs and the intelligence [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  community to decouple social movements from the class analysis and the class [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=251.94s)]
*  and the economics and just push it all into culture. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=258.86s)]
*  And that's been forever. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=262.74s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, I mean, uh, they, they, they, they, they, they, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=264.5s)]
*  just like anti-war in the sixties, they used to be regular people buttoned down. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=268.58s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it was all hippies and the smelly people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=273.78s)]
*  And well, Charles Manson. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=276.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=277.62s)]
*  And so that's, I mean, that's not, uh, so, and now it's led up to this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=278.78s)]
*  And I've, I sniffed this out about the trans issue, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=284.18s)]
*  Cause everybody was on board with gay rights. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=287.5s)]
*  Everybody, you know, they went in the nineties, they used to be second class [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=290.1s)]
*  citizens and now they're not right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=293.42s)]
*  And, but, so then they had to in, and I saw that, uh, the, the head of that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=295.5s)]
*  Fink, the head of the black rock, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=300.74s)]
*  I saw him giving this spam like, oh, that's what this is. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=303.38s)]
*  He was Larry Fink is a trans rights activist now. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=306.34s)]
*  All those, I'm like this son of a bitch is so he's out there raping the planet [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=309.5s)]
*  and screwing over workers and the middle class. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=313.9s)]
*  And so he gets to wrap himself in this patina of virtue by saying I'm for trans [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=317.74s)]
*  rights and we have to force it down. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  People's throw. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=324.26s)]
*  I mean, basically I'm paraphrasing, but that's basically what he said. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=324.86s)]
*  And that's when I knew what was happening because this is not a grassroots. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=328.26s)]
*  This is an income from the grassroots up. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=331.46s)]
*  And this is something that even turns the LG, the gay community against each other. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=333.46s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=337.62s)]
*  So this is all about divide and conquer. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=338.18s)]
*  And it's been about, so that's what's, that's what wokeness is about. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=340.86s)]
*  It's about divide and conquer. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=343.94s)]
*  And it's not, it didn't just start. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=345.74s)]
*  It's been going on since world war two. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  And, uh, they, last thing they want you to do is have a class analysis. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=349.62s)]
*  And that's what, so why is it the people who voted for Bernie Sanders [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=354.14s)]
*  and voted for Donald Trump, right? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=357.94s)]
*  There's a class analysis that would go along with that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  Michael Moore, of all people in 2016, I don't know if you ever saw, there's a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=362.5s)]
*  video of him giving that speech about why do you think these people aren't all [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=366.62s)]
*  racist? These people are, these are people who voted for Barack Obama twice. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=371.14s)]
*  These are people who voted for Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=374.9s)]
*  Why are they, uh, attracted to Donald Trump? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=376.58s)]
*  Because he stood there and said, if you ship their jobs to Mexico, I'm going to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=379.94s)]
*  put a tariff on you and you're not going to be able to sell a car and that no [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=384.38s)]
*  other politician would say something like this is Michael Moore giving that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=387.78s)]
*  analysis, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=390.82s)]
*  And so you haven't heard him say that stuff since because he got spanked. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=391.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=395.74s)]
*  So there's so many threads here and I want to get to that because I'm [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=395.98s)]
*  fascinated by AOC, same thing. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=398.26s)]
*  Um, and a couple, and a couple of others, um, who should be, I don't know, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=400.38s)]
*  Trump supporters necessarily, but they should be making common cause with Trump [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=406.18s)]
*  on, on the promise of a fairer economic system. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  And they're not and why, but let me just get back to your great point that this, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=414.7s)]
*  that wokeness was used as a tool by the people making the most money going back [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=418.5s)]
*  80 years. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=423.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=423.94s)]
*  So this is why Malcolm X had a short lifespan. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=426.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=427.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=427.7s)]
*  So if you actually listen to Malcolm X speeches, they're not about race. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=428.1s)]
*  Well, he went and had an awakening. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=432.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=434.22s)]
*  He had an awakening. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=435.06s)]
*  It's like, Oh, there's, there's white Muslims. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=435.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=437.86s)]
*  And he realized that that wasn't the game. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=438.70000000000005s)]
*  And as soon as that happened, he had a short life. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=440.86s)]
*  And so same thing when Martin Luther King decided it was about class and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  not about race and no, they want it to be about race. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=447.86s)]
*  And so you've seen the studies, I'm sure that, you know, after Occupy Wall Street. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=450.74s)]
*  So you had the, the, um, the tea party, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=454.78000000000003s)]
*  They were upset about what happened during the economic crash in Wall [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=458.82s)]
*  Street and the government bailing them out and kicking, kicking people out of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=462.02000000000004s)]
*  their houses and making sure the bold, you know, the way I said it was Barack [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=466.18s)]
*  Obama made sure the bankers got his, their, their bonuses while he kicked 5.1 [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=469.42s)]
*  million families out of their homes, not people five, one million families. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=473.66s)]
*  And then you find out that he got more money from Wall Street than John McCain [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=477.74s)]
*  did, and you find out that, uh, yes. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=481.66s)]
*  And that every, there was an email from Wall Street, from Citigroup to the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=485.1s)]
*  Barack Obama campaign with a list of people they wanted in his, in his cabinet. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=489.66s)]
*  Every person on that list ended up in his cabinet. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=493.66s)]
*  And the reason I know that because that got released by WikiLeaks and that's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=496.74s)]
*  why they've been trying to kill Julian Assange ever since. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=500.14s)]
*  And so they all are working. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=503.02s)]
*  You know, he wasn't a departure from George W. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=504.82s)]
*  Bush, Barack Obama, just his skin color. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=506.94s)]
*  He took us from two wars to seven. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=508.97999999999996s)]
*  He was, uh, he gave us a right-wing healthcare plan, which was, came out of [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=510.94s)]
*  the heritage foundation, which is the same people I gave you project 2025. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=514.5s)]
*  And, uh, you know, he gave us Mitt Romney's, uh, healthcare plan. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=518.86s)]
*  So, uh, and he deported all those, it's, he dropped more bombs than George [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=522.38s)]
*  Bush and nobody noticed, and that's why they wanted to have Kamala Harris. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=526.98s)]
*  That was their first choice. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=531.1s)]
*  The donor class was Kamala Harris was there. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=532.66s)]
*  They thought we'd have a female Barack Obama and that's a good face for imperialism. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=534.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=539.6999999999999s)]
*  Because we have a black woman bombing and stealing resources and doing [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=540.2199999999999s)]
*  neoliberal and neocon policies. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=544.26s)]
*  That's perfect. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=546.54s)]
*  And that she couldn't get a vote. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=547.5799999999999s)]
*  So then they had to go to their second most reliable person, which was Joe Biden. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=548.9399999999999s)]
*  That's exactly how it works. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=553.42s)]
*  I don't know if you remember, but they coordinated her on Martha's Vineyard. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=554.5799999999999s)]
*  She's going to be our candidate. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=557.9s)]
*  And they thought they had the black Barack Obama, but she couldn't get a vote. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=559.3s)]
*  She has no political talent. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=562.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=563.86s)]
*  And so then they forced her on Joe Biden as the vice president. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=564.3s)]
*  And then of course they did a coup, just like Jim Gaffigan said at the L Smith [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=567.62s)]
*  dinner, they had the, they had the, uh, the debates way earlier than they normally [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=570.9399999999999s)]
*  would, so they would give them enough time to install Kamala Harris. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=575.38s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=578.98s)]
*  So I don't know how I got off on this tangent, but, uh, yes, that's, and that's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=580.86s)]
*  the, Oh, we know that after Wall Street, after Occupy Wall Street and the tea [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=585.02s)]
*  party, then, uh, the major newspapers, the mentions of racism and white supremacy. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=589.46s)]
*  People have studied this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=596.38s)]
*  I did. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=597.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm not making this up. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=597.62s)]
*  I'm just quoting studies and went through the roof. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=598.58s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=600.9s)]
*  That's because as Chomsky taught us, the newspapers aren't there to inform you [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=601.62s)]
*  there to manufacture consent. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=605.26s)]
*  And one of the great ways to manufacture consent for the establishment [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=607.0600000000001s)]
*  is to divide and conquer. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=610.38s)]
*  It's been there ever since World War II. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=611.54s)]
*  It's been divide and conquer. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=613.78s)]
*  And that's exactly what they did. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=615.1800000000001s)]
*  So they got everybody hyper, uh, identity. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=616.5s)]
*  It's that's what identity politics is. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=618.62s)]
*  And it's got everybody till you identify with your skin color, you [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=620.66s)]
*  identify, it's the opposite of Martin Luther King. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=623.86s)]
*  It's the opposite of judge someone by the content of their character. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=625.98s)]
*  And so now everybody's identified with their gender or their sexual preference [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=629.54s)]
*  or their skin color or their ethnicity. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=633.78s)]
*  And they got us all siloed off and split up. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=636.22s)]
*  Uh, but what we need to do is what Christian Smalls did on Staten Island [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=638.74s)]
*  when he started the first labor union to, uh, for Amazon. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=642.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=647.22s)]
*  So here's a black guy on Staten Island. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=647.5400000000001s)]
*  And what is he doing? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=650.1s)]
*  He's organizing a bunch of Trump voters to go against Jeff Bezos and the machine. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=650.86s)]
*  And he won. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=655.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=656.82s)]
*  And he didn't do that by saying, Hey, who hears a gun nut? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=657.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=660.26s)]
*  You are out. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=660.58s)]
*  Who here supports the trans? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=661.1800000000001s)]
*  You don't. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=662.74s)]
*  You're out. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=663.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=663.94s)]
*  Who here? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=664.34s)]
*  No, that's not how you organize, right? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=664.98s)]
*  Who's left? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=667.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=667.9000000000001s)]
*  Now I'm going to organize with the rest of you. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=668.1800000000001s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=670.02s)]
*  You go, we have an economic interest. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=670.9s)]
*  We share a common economic interest and we share a common enemy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=673.78s)]
*  And that enemy is Jeff Bezos and the establishment who's with me. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=677.66s)]
*  And they were with them. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=681.4599999999999s)]
*  And, you know, uh, if the, the funny thing is when you win a, when you win a union [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=682.62s)]
*  like that, or you win economic gains for everybody, the people who [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=688.98s)]
*  disproportionately are benefited are the, are the people of color are the, you [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=692.78s)]
*  know, if you give black people have more medical debt per capita than white [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=697.26s)]
*  people, if you give everybody healthcare that are going to help them more. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=700.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=704.42s)]
*  So you give everybody healthcare. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=704.74s)]
*  It helps the trans community you get. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=706.66s)]
*  So that's the, you give everybody a living wage, a strong union that [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=708.78s)]
*  helps everybody more and the people who are more disproportionately helped are [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=712.42s)]
*  the people who you can normally consider the most vulnerable in your society. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=716.9s)]
*  So that's the irony, but they want us fighting over things that just help your [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=720.9s)]
*  little, you fight over trans rights, fight over reparations, fight over this. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=725.0600000000001s)]
*  Instead of fight over something that helps everybody. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=729.8199999999999s)]
*  And that's what the, so that's what dividing conference. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=732.54s)]
*  And that's why we are where we are, Tucker. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=735.3s)]
*  Well, it's such a smart analysis. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=736.9399999999999s)]
*  And I just want to say for the record, I agree with every single word that you said. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=739.26s)]
*  Um, but to first, uh, it's just incredibly easy to divide people, you know, from [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=742.4599999999999s)]
*  outside, it really is, especially along the lines of immutable characteristics, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=749.78s)]
*  cause they don't change. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=755.5s)]
*  And so the conflicts tend to be irresolvable. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=756.5s)]
*  I mean, you can go from a Bernie voter to a Trump voter to whatever's next voter. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=758.86s)]
*  You can change your, you cannot change your skin color. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=762.86s)]
*  Um, and so once you create those divisions, like they're permanent [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=765.5400000000001s)]
*  and you wreck your society, but I just detect in your worldview, something [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=768.94s)]
*  that you don't see very often, which is universalism, your instinct or your [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=772.86s)]
*  sense of the world seems to be based on the idea that there are principles that [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=778.46s)]
*  apply to everyone, regardless of what they look like. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=781.62s)]
*  And I thought that's, I mean, that's what Western civilization was based on. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=786.4599999999999s)]
*  That's Christianity, by the way. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=789.9s)]
*  But I don't see people approaching questions with that assumption as much anymore. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=791.8199999999999s)]
*  Uh, no, because they're propagandized to do the other. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=798.74s)]
*  And you know, the American people I've, uh, I've said this, my friend, uh, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=801.86s)]
*  Nick Cruz says this Americans are the most propagandized people in the entire [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=806.38s)]
*  world and they don't have any idea that they are, you know, at least people in [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=810.1s)]
*  China know they're being propagandized. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=813.98s)]
*  The people in the old Soviet Union knew it was propaganda. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=815.94s)]
*  People in America turn on Anderson Cooper, turn on, uh, Rachel Maddow, Sean Hannity. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=818.98s)]
*  They think they're getting the truth. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=824.94s)]
*  They really do. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=826.26s)]
*  They think, you know, Hey, don't you think it's a little weird when Sean [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=827.46s)]
*  Hannity and Rachel Maddow are saying the exact same thing about Ukraine? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=830.14s)]
*  Don't you think that's weird? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=834.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, yes, in fact, I did. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=837.02s)]
*  It's funny you mentioned that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=838.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=839.82s)]
*  And so, uh, you know, I try to remind people that, you know, um, that you got [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=840.62s)]
*  fired, not because you were going along with the wars and telling the lies of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=846.38s)]
*  the wars when you were going along with the Iraq war, they couldn't give you [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=850.34s)]
*  enough TV shows, right? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=853.58s)]
*  You were on CNN, you MSNBC. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=854.7s)]
*  Your number one guest was Rachel Maddow. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=856.78s)]
*  Then you had the number one show on Fox. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=858.62s)]
*  It was when you started to tell the truth. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=860.38s)]
*  They don't fire you for lying about wars. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=862.1s)]
*  They don't, they fire you for telling the truth about the wars. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=865.58s)]
*  And that's just same reason why Julian Assange was in prison. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=868.62s)]
*  He wasn't in prison because he lied about the war machine. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=871.86s)]
*  He was in prison because he told the truth. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=875.26s)]
*  And that's what people need to realize. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=877.5s)]
*  And I try to, I ask people when I have these conversations with my old liberal [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=879.0600000000001s)]
*  friends from Hollywood, uh, the ones who still talk to me and I'll say, is there [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=883.34s)]
*  anything you hear on cable news that you don't believe? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=887.94s)]
*  Is there anything? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=891.02s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=892.34s)]
*  They never say anything back. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=892.9s)]
*  They never say, well, I don't believe that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=895.1s)]
*  They never say anything. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=896.94s)]
*  They just change the subject or move on to something else. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=898.06s)]
*  You really think they were just accepting the whole sandwich? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=900.4599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=902.8199999999999s)]
*  Just swallowing without chewing. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=903.5799999999999s)]
*  Just. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=904.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=905.3s)]
*  And that was the beginning of the end for me was, uh, when I wouldn't go [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=905.9s)]
*  along with Hillary Clinton, cause I was a big, I've always been a liberal [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=910.9399999999999s)]
*  progressive and, uh, I've supported Bernie Sanders. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=914.14s)]
*  I thought we were really close to doing something at that convention in 2016. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=917.78s)]
*  And Philadelphia, I was there and you walked into the convention hall and half [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=922.14s)]
*  the people in there wanted to overthrow the democratic establishment. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=926.5799999999999s)]
*  Half the people there wanted to get corporate money out of politics. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=929.86s)]
*  And there was lots of friction. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=933.42s)]
*  They were turning the lights out. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=935.06s)]
*  They were using sound. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=936.4599999999999s)]
*  Can the whole day was, and it really felt like we were about to do something. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=937.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=941.42s)]
*  And then I went, um, to the last convention just this year in Chicago. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=941.9399999999999s)]
*  And it was like a step for his wife's convention. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=947.2199999999999s)]
*  It was brainwashed, brain dead, go alongs. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=949.4599999999999s)]
*  Nobody had a thought in their head. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=952.3399999999999s)]
*  Nope. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=954.86s)]
*  They were there cheering on billionaires and cheering on the war machine. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=955.1s)]
*  And it was growing. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=959.66s)]
*  CI director, billionaires on stage from, from, you know, Oprah talking about how [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=961.3s)]
*  she's a victim of sexism, racism. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=967.6999999999999s)]
*  That was one of the funniest things. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=970.42s)]
*  That's like Oprah since I've been in college, she's been a highly touted [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=972.02s)]
*  celebrity with her own television show. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=975.42s)]
*  There might've been a time in her life when she was discriminated against, but [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=977.54s)]
*  boys, she certainly made up for it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=980.4599999999999s)]
*  And for her to be the voice of that was really disgusting. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=982.02s)]
*  And then you had Pritzker come on stage. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=984.94s)]
*  I'm a real billionaire and people are chairman like, is this the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=986.9s)]
*  democratic party, the democratic party? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=989.58s)]
*  And so that's what happened with Bill Clinton. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=992.38s)]
*  How did they treat you by the way at the convention? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=994.1s)]
*  Uh, I couldn't stay there long. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=996.02s)]
*  I had a pass to be on the floor. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=997.66s)]
*  It honestly, it depressed me, uh, to the point of almost tears. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=999.82s)]
*  And I would go up to people. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1003.7s)]
*  I would go up to delegates and I would say, does it bother you that the, the, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1005.78s)]
*  the party who's putting democracy on the ballot, uh, throughout 14 million ballots [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1009.7s)]
*  and installed, uh, Kamala Harris and to a person, they would all say there was a [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1014.5s)]
*  process, she followed the process. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1019.66s)]
*  They didn't care. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1022.0600000000001s)]
*  Nobody cared. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1022.98s)]
*  They don't care anything. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1023.7s)]
*  They didn't care that she didn't get a vote. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1024.58s)]
*  They don't care that they threw out the guy who did get a vote. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1026.38s)]
*  They didn't care that they were lied to about his mental, uh, his dementia for [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1028.66s)]
*  years, they didn't mind nothing, nothing. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1032.62s)]
*  And they were all about, it was the only, it was, and they talk about abortion. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1034.98s)]
*  At the convention, like it's a day, it's like it's Christmas and you know, like, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1039.6999999999998s)]
*  Hey, I'm, I w I always, you know, like bill lib, the old liberals, I always was [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1044.1399999999999s)]
*  like, you know, let's, let's make abortion safe, legal and rare, right? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1049.3s)]
*  And they're like, no, let's, let's cheer it on. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1053.6599999999999s)]
*  Like it's Christmas. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1055.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, that's weird. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1056.82s)]
*  It's like cheering on amputation, like, yay, you get to get your amputation. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1058.06s)]
*  I'm like, no, that's something that's if you have to have it, that's it's, I'm [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1061.4599999999998s)]
*  glad it's available, but that's always a sad day anyways. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1064.9399999999998s)]
*  So that's where. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1068.1399999999999s)]
*  What is that about? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1068.9s)]
*  I really noticed that because I've been covering this stuff since 92 and. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1070.26s)]
*  Clinton, I mean, I've always been against abortion. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1075.18s)]
*  I'm just gonna say that, um, agree or disagree with me, but I, you know, I [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1077.7800000000002s)]
*  feel that way, but I remember Clinton really kind of going out of his way to [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1081.1000000000001s)]
*  be like this, it's a sad thing. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1084.22s)]
*  And, but we think in these circumstances, it should be legal. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1085.7s)]
*  And I'm so struck by the change. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1090.22s)]
*  What, what is that? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1091.9s)]
*  Well, uh, I had a conversation at the convention with someone who [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1094.18s)]
*  was, um, she's in this woman's rights organization. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1098.5s)]
*  She was the head of it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1103.02s)]
*  And I don't want to mention her name, but she, uh, I was saying, well, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1103.98s)]
*  I've always been pro-choice. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1107.38s)]
*  I don't want a G man in between doctor and a patient. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1108.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1112.1s)]
*  I will. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1112.42s)]
*  I trust women. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1112.74s)]
*  I trust doctors to make that decision without a government stepping. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1113.82s)]
*  And, uh, she's like, well, that's not good enough. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1117.74s)]
*  You have to be pro-abortion. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1119.94s)]
*  And I'm like, that just seems, I'm, and I'm like, well, what's your [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1121.54s)]
*  message to someone like me who's pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1124.18s)]
*  And she's like, well, that's a longer conversation. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1127.82s)]
*  I'm like, you don't have a, you don't have a message for me. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1129.86s)]
*  Are you sitting? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1133.94s)]
*  She said you have to be pro-abortion. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1134.6599999999999s)]
*  Pro-abortion. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1136.34s)]
*  I mean, it blew me away. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1137.02s)]
*  And, uh, this is someone I like and respect and it's very funny and all that stuff. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1138.98s)]
*  But I didn't see it coming because I've been saying, cause during COVID, they [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1143.78s)]
*  went from being pro-choice to pro-abortion, which I noticed, right? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1148.42s)]
*  I know it because it sounds so weird coming off your lips. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1152.82s)]
*  I'm pro-abortion. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1156.62s)]
*  You're pro, no, you're supposed to be pro-choice. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1157.6999999999998s)]
*  It's supposed to be bodily autonomy, which they don't say anymore because [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1159.86s)]
*  they were all for the mandated emergency medical, uh, treatment, which was [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1162.82s)]
*  COVID vaccines with no long-term studies. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1167.54s)]
*  They were for making people take that. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1169.62s)]
*  And so that's the exact opposite of bodily autonomy. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1171.58s)]
*  Something that I've said my entire life, everybody who will call [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1174.1799999999998s)]
*  themselves a liberal has said, well, they stopped saying that because [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1176.9799999999998s)]
*  they're not for bodily autonomy. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1179.5s)]
*  They're for the government being able to mandate an experimental medical [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1181.1399999999999s)]
*  treatment while they're lying to you about it. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1185.18s)]
*  Uh, but they're, they're, they're pro-abortion. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1187.46s)]
*  And I was, so I would say on my show that nobody's pro-abortion. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1189.66s)]
*  And then I met someone at the convention who was, and I was just like, whoa, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1193.26s)]
*  it still kind of blows me away. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1198.78s)]
*  Natural disasters, wars, political conflicts, the recent threatened [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1200.3400000000001s)]
*  dock worker strikes at ports around the country. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1206.0600000000002s)]
*  All of these are reminders that things that we take for granted in this country, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1209.0600000000002s)]
*  like medicine, are all dependent on a long and fragile supply chain. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1214.22s)]
*  If something happens to that supply chain, you and your family will not be able [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1219.7s)]
*  to get things that you need to live. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1224.7800000000002s)]
*  So right now seems like a pretty good time to stock up on essentials for when [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1227.9s)]
*  the next unexpected disaster hits, because it's coming. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1232.46s)]
*  We know that. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1236.14s)]
*  That's why we're partnering with JACE medical, which can supply you and your [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1237.5400000000002s)]

*  So the JACE case is a personalized emergency medication kit that contains [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1254.42s)]
*  essential antibiotics and medications to treat the most common and potentially [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1258.62s)]
*  deadly bacterial infections, for example, and then a whole host of add-on [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1262.54s)]
*  medicines from ivermectin to EpiPens, depending on what you and your family [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1267.3s)]
*  may need. How hard is it to get this? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1271.54s)]
*  Not hard. The process is quick and easy. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1273.3799999999999s)]
*  You fill out an online form, you consult with their physician, and you receive [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1276.22s)]
*  your medications through a licensed pharmacy at a fraction of the regular [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1280.34s)]
*  price. It is all totally above board, completely legit. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1284.26s)]
*  And in the case of a disruption to our supply chain, which again, could very [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1288.3s)]
*  easily happen, it could mean the difference between surviving and not. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1291.14s)]
*  So we recommend it. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1295.0600000000002s)]
*  Go to JACE.com, use code TUCKER at checkout for a discount on your order. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1296.22s)]

*  You have any idea what that it blows me away to again, and I'm coming up from [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1305.22s)]
*  exactly the opposite perspective. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1309.8600000000001s)]
*  I've always disagreed with a pro-choice position. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1311.18s)]
*  But I also thought when I would listen to Clinton, I'd be like, I get it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1315.26s)]
*  I get why people feel, you know, 13 year old girl raped. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1318.5800000000002s)]

*  I mean, I understand why people are like, yeah, she should have an abortion or [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1323.26s)]
*  have the right to. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1326.8600000000001s)]
*  This is such a different message. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1328.5s)]
*  And I just don't know where that came from or why that it's just really [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1331.42s)]
*  striking to me. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1334.46s)]
*  It's dark. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1335.54s)]
*  Super dark. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1336.54s)]
*  I think it's super dark. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1337.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1338.9s)]
*  But those are the same people who can turn their head at the genocide happening [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1339.26s)]
*  in Palestine and say things. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1344.14s)]
*  I mean, I would turn to people who I liberal their whole life. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1347.02s)]
*  I'm like, so you stand with the people of Palestine, right? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1350.86s)]
*  They're like, Kamala is not the president of the Middle East. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1353.94s)]
*  They'll say things like that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1356.7s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1358.3799999999999s)]
*  But she is funding it. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1359.66s)]
*  And it's like, well, Trump is going to be worse. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1360.94s)]
*  What is he going to do? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1363.78s)]
*  Dig up the dead babies and kill them again? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1364.78s)]
*  It, you know, if Trump is worse than we deal with Trump when that happens. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1367.18s)]
*  But right now you cannot reward what the Democratic administration is doing with [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1370.62s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1376.74s)]
*  You cannot reward them with your vote. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1378.1399999999999s)]
*  You have to make them pay a price. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1379.82s)]
*  You have to influence them. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1381.86s)]
*  And that's why now all the every Muslim mayor in Michigan came out and I'm pretty [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1383.74s)]
*  sure just endorsed Donald Trump. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1388.5s)]
*  And so you're going to, you're going to, you're going to wag your finger at those [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1390.3s)]
*  people. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1393.26s)]
*  I've seen people, uh, uh, prior priority. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1393.54s)]
*  They go, well, Trump's going to go house to house. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1396.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm care. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1398.5s)]
*  I work with immigrants and Trump's going to go house to house and kick them out. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1399.06s)]
*  And I'm like, so you're prioritizing the, the immigration status of migrants over [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1403.3s)]
*  the literal slaughter of Palestinian children. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1409.34s)]
*  That's morally repugnant. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1412.06s)]
*  And as you know, Thomas Frank said in listen to liberal, you know, that when you [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1413.6999999999998s)]
*  listen to these people moralize it's stomach churning and that is dumb. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1417.74s)]
*  It's just like, you're just bending yourself in a press. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1421.26s)]
*  There's nothing. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1423.22s)]
*  So there's no red line. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1423.74s)]
*  I have a red line. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1424.78s)]
*  My red line is genocide. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1425.6599999999999s)]
*  And, uh, you know, Kamala Harris could come get my vote. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1427.34s)]
*  You know, if she said, Hey, you know what? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1430.82s)]
*  I'm not going to do, I'm not going to fund Israel anymore. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1432.26s)]
*  That's their problem or his something. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1434.74s)]
*  Uh, she won't do it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1437.06s)]
*  And so if you're, if you're willing to go along with that, there's no doubt [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1438.22s)]
*  you're not voting for a lesser evil. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1441.98s)]
*  You're just voting for straight up evil and you're doing mental gymnastics to [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1443.7s)]
*  make yourself feel better about it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1447.38s)]
*  People have to lie to themselves about Donald Trump, the same establishment [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1449.14s)]

*  Right. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1466.8200000000002s)]
*  And, uh, Oprah loved him. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1467.14s)]

*  And if you look at what he was saying about what caused that pivot, uh, the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1482.7800000000002s)]
*  establishment, so the establishment does, they couldn't control him. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1487.3000000000002s)]
*  He's, you know, like I've heard you say, they're afraid he's going to do one [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1490.6200000000001s)]
*  less war than they want. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1493.26s)]
*  And so they can control him. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1494.9s)]
*  And he's also, as, uh, Aaron Maté has pointed out that he puts an ugly [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1496.54s)]
*  face on imperialism, right? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1501.1s)]
*  Because now they painted this guy as a white supremacist and he, you know, he [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1503.06s)]
*  speaks in a crude way often, and he puts an ugly face on imperialism. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1507.02s)]
*  So it makes it harder for them to invade small Brown countries and [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1511.46s)]
*  steal their natural resources. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1515.1s)]
*  A lot of user, if it's Barack Obama doing it, look at what he did to Libya. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1516.62s)]
*  Like what they did to Syria, like what they did to Afghanistan for 20 years. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1520.3s)]
*  Yemen, the whole deal. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1523.8999999999999s)]
*  Uh, so it makes it so, but Trump makes it harder for them, right? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1525.4599999999998s)]
*  And plus he's a wild card. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1529.4599999999998s)]
*  He won't, he wouldn't go along. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1530.6599999999999s)]
*  That's why the, that's why they lied about him. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1532.1s)]
*  That's why the CIA lied in aid of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris about Hunter's laptop. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1534.1s)]
*  That's why they did Russia gate, which was concocted by the Hillary Clinton [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1540.4199999999998s)]
*  campaign, and that's why the FBI lied to the vice, FISA court 17 times. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1544.1s)]
*  So they could get a phone tap on Donald Trump's phone and his entire organization. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1549.6999999999998s)]
*  And they still couldn't find a crime that they wanted to impeach him over because [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1554.1s)]
*  they had to find a crime that they weren't also complicit in. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1557.62s)]
*  That's why it took so long. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1559.98s)]
*  So, uh, so for me saying, you know, and I, when I had Cornell West on my show, I [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1561.9s)]
*  tried to impress upon him that don't you see like, you don't have to like Donald [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1568.1s)]
*  Trump, right? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1572.02s)]
*  I didn't vote for Donald Trump, but what you see they're doing to Donald Trump, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1573.26s)]
*  they would do to anybody. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1577.62s)]
*  And when I say they, I mean, the establishment and the handful of billionaires [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1579.18s)]
*  that actually run the Western world and our media, they would end and own the [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1583.34s)]
*  Congress, they would do to anybody who stood up. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1587.62s)]
*  Look what they did to Bernie Sanders, right? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1590.62s)]
*  So when there was a chance that Bernie Sanders was going to become the nominee, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1591.98s)]
*  they immediately Russia gated him. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1595.6999999999998s)]
*  They immediately called him a sexist. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1597.4599999999998s)]
*  They immediately called his followers racist and sexist and violent. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1599.06s)]
*  They did the exact same thing. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1602.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's what I tried to impress upon climate. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1603.8999999999999s)]
*  They would do this to you. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1606.26s)]
*  They would do this to Bernie Sanders. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1607.58s)]
*  They would do it to me. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1609.22s)]
*  They would do it to Jill. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1610.4599999999998s)]
*  They do it to Jill Stein. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1611.3s)]
*  They do it to anybody who they can't control. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1612.34s)]
*  And Cornel West's response to me was to call me a Trumper. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1615.26s)]
*  That was one of the saddest things. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1618.62s)]
*  That was one of the saddest things in my life. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1620.78s)]
*  I know Cornel and I, you know, very complicated person, but in some ways a good [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1622.34s)]
*  hearted person. In many ways. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1627.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he is. And he's smart. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1630.02s)]
*  He's legit smart. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1631.4199999999998s)]
*  But he has lived in, you know, he told me that we live in two different worlds. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1632.1399999999999s)]
*  And I was like, we sure do. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1635.34s)]
*  You live in an ivory tower your entire life. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1636.58s)]
*  And I came from blue collar background and my whole life. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1639.18s)]
*  And I'm out there with the people all the time. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1643.14s)]
*  I tour the country constantly. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1645.6200000000001s)]
*  I do meet and greets and meet hundreds of people every night. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1647.5s)]
*  And they look at me in the eye and the eye [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1650.5800000000002s)]
*  with some of them with tears in their eye and they thank me for what I'm doing [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1653.54s)]
*  and for what I'm saying. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1657.02s)]
*  And even though they don't agree with me [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1658.02s)]
*  politically, like I would say half my audience is to traditional liberals. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1659.42s)]
*  The other half are libertarians or [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1664.02s)]
*  conservatives and an ex-military. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1666.1s)]
*  You know, I remember recently I had a guy said, you know, I've served in three, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1669.86s)]
*  three different countries and three different wars. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1674.1s)]
*  And I watched your show and I woke up and now I realize what's going on. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1676.94s)]
*  And those are the kind of things that, you know, kind of never leave me. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1680.74s)]
*  I've had I've had military guys try to give me their medals. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1684.3799999999999s)]
*  And, you know, it's just it's overwhelming [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1687.6599999999999s)]
*  emotionally for me to meet these people. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1690.02s)]
*  And so that's what I that's the world I come from. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1692.26s)]
*  And that's not the world the media comes from. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1697.1399999999999s)]
*  That's not the world that Cornel West comes from. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1699.06s)]
*  And because Cornel West is black, he kind of has a trump card where he can say [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1701.4599999999998s)]
*  you've never suffered like I have. You don't know what it's like. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1706.5s)]
*  I don't know what it's like to live and work in Harvard and Yale and Princeton. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1709.62s)]
*  That's got to be miserable. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1714.1799999999998s)]
*  You're so you're so right. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1717.54s)]
*  So let me just get back to [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1719.18s)]
*  what I wanted to ask you a couple of minutes ago, which is the people who [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1721.3000000000002s)]
*  should know better and Cornel West is certainly in that category. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1724.5s)]
*  Well, look what happened during that was my big beef when I had him on because he [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1727.66s)]
*  wouldn't say a peep during Covid. I'm like, you know, really? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1731.74s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1735.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, now he's now he is saying something. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1736.6200000000001s)]
*  He's picked up Bobby Kennedy's. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1739.42s)]
*  But, you know, I was like, you know, where were you when he's always I stand [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1741.14s)]
*  solidarity with workers and I'm like, well, they fired seventy thousand health [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1746.1s)]
*  care workers in one state alone because they wouldn't take an experimental [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1749.74s)]
*  medical treatment. Where were you then? Right. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1752.7s)]
*  Forty one percent of black owned businesses closed permanently during Covid. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1755.6599999999999s)]
*  Where were you then? Where were you screaming about that? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1760.82s)]
*  Where was your solidarity then? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1763.22s)]
*  And so I don't want to pick on Cornel West. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1764.86s)]
*  He's got a lot of like them. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1767.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah, no, I agree. And I like it. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1769.46s)]
*  But it was a very big letdown. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1771.06s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1772.74s)]
*  So my question is not even to get personal about it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1773.66s)]
*  Or AOC is someone who has called me a white supremacist a thousand times. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1776.46s)]
*  But I still look at her and I say this is a woman with with talent. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1781.14s)]
*  I think she does have talent. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1785.98s)]
*  I'm sure she'll disavow me for saying that. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1788.3400000000001s)]
*  But she's also said a few things over the years. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1790.46s)]
*  Like you could be closer to the right track than you are. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1793.0200000000002s)]
*  But she seems to have sold out immediately. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1796.1000000000001s)]
*  And I would also say not to be mean, but Bernie Sanders, same thing. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1798.98s)]
*  Like what? What? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1802.14s)]
*  And Michael Moore of all, not only was he, you know, on a populist streak [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1803.42s)]
*  and he's actually from industrial Michigan, he's also fat, which I think is significant. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1809.74s)]
*  No, no, I'm not being mean. I'm being serious. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1815.06s)]
*  No one in the ruling class is fat. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1816.74s)]
*  A lot of America is fat. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1818.5800000000002s)]
*  Michael Moore, like he he seemed a little bit more real than or potentially more [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1820.06s)]
*  real than a lot of the spokesmen for the left. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1825.66s)]
*  Why is he going along with it? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1828.1000000000001s)]
*  Like, what is this? Why are there no independent voices? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1830.06s)]
*  That's funny, because he was like I pointed out earlier in this conversation. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1833.54s)]
*  He was the one who gave that big speech about why regular people are attracted [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1837.7s)]
*  to Donald Trump, and it's because they want to give an F.U. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1842.1399999999999s)]
*  to the establishment that has left them behind. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1844.9s)]
*  And the Democratic Party has certainly left workers behind. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1847.22s)]
*  And they crushed the railroad union strike, all of them, the Democrats. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1849.9s)]
*  They all did that and pretended they did and pretended they didn't pretend [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1853.34s)]
*  that they're somehow the they're the party of the workers. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1856.42s)]
*  There is that it all ended with Bill Clinton. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1859.1399999999999s)]
*  Bill Clinton was no friend of the working man. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1861.1s)]
*  He got, you know, after Ronald Reagan, he he called up Wall Street. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1863.3s)]
*  They had the Democratic Leadership Council. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1867.02s)]
*  You remember that the DNC? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1869.02s)]
*  Do you remember who was on it? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1870.6599999999999s)]
*  They had people from the Koch brothers sitting on their board. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1871.6999999999998s)]
*  And so there was and I mean, he gutted welfare. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1874.8999999999999s)]
*  He increased the police state. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1879.2199999999998s)]
*  He deregulated Wall Street, which came to crass the economy. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1883.62s)]
*  And hurt black and brown people more than anybody within 10 years. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1889.2199999999998s)]
*  He did that. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1892.1s)]
*  He explained exploded the prison population. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1892.98s)]
*  And he had a private plan with Newt Gingrich to privatize Social Security. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1895.86s)]
*  But Monica Lewinsky screwed that plan up. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1900.34s)]
*  If you read Listen, Liberal and so he and he did NAFTA, which cut the legs out [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1902.62s)]
*  from underneath the working unions for a generation. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1908.02s)]
*  Those are things that Republicans couldn't do, which is why people like [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1910.78s)]
*  Glenn Ford in the Black Agenda report has said that the Democrats are the greater [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1913.98s)]
*  evil, the more effective evil, because they can get stuff done that Republicans [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1917.78s)]
*  couldn't, you know, they've reached the Malcolm X position. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1921.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1924.14s)]
*  So George when George Bush, the first wanted to do NAFTA, he couldn't get it [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1925.02s)]
*  passed because there is the certain Democrats in the South who wouldn't go [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1929.66s)]
*  along with that. Bill Clinton came in and gave them cover. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1933.74s)]
*  And then they did it. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1937.02s)]
*  They did NAFTA rights, which screwed over. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1937.94s)]
*  So Barack Obama, he's dropped more bombs than George W. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1940.14s)]
*  Bush and nobody made a peep. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1944.9s)]
*  But how do you control critics who know better? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1946.34s)]
*  That's what I don't get. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1949.26s)]
*  And Michael Moore specifically, Michael Moore had his own franchise. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1950.18s)]
*  He's not dependent. He doesn't have a cable contract. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1953.18s)]
*  He doesn't. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1955.34s)]
*  He was sort of outside. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1956.22s)]
*  Here, I'm not I'm not complimenting Michael Moore. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1957.98s)]
*  I'm just I'm just noting like the guy had talent. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1959.82s)]
*  He had his own income stream. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1962.98s)]
*  He had some insight into what was actually going along along the lines of what you [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1964.98s)]
*  just said. So how do you get Michael Moore to obey you and join forces with Larry Fink? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1969.98s)]
*  I think it's the same way they got John Stewart. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1975.02s)]
*  Right. So John Stewart went on Stephen Colbert and he told the truth about where [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1977.62s)]
*  the covid virus came from. I remember. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1982.82s)]
*  Do you remember that? Yeah. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1984.94s)]
*  And Stephen Colbert tried to stop him at every turn to the point where John Stewart [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1985.74s)]
*  had to get up off the chair and walked directly towards the camera and finished [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1989.86s)]
*  what he was saying. So Stephen Colbert couldn't interrupt him. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1993.98s)]
*  Do you remember that? It was very well. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1996.78s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1998.58s)]
*  And then he got completely dismantled or completely [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=1999.3799999999999s)]
*  ostracized by polite liberal establishment. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2004.1s)]
*  And he spent the next year trying to get back into their good graces. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2007.3799999999999s)]
*  That's what I think it is. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2011.86s)]
*  It's that we have that built into us through evolution. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2013.06s)]
*  You want to be part of a group. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2016.3s)]
*  And he was no longer part. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2017.54s)]
*  He even talked about it like I didn't realize that there was a right wing position [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2018.82s)]
*  on covid and there was a left wing. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2023.7s)]
*  There was a conservative. I didn't realize that. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2025.22s)]
*  Well, he freaking got his mind right. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2027.46s)]
*  And to make up for it, he then had to pin a medal on a Nazi at Disney World. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2029.3799999999999s)]
*  A legit, legit Nazi, which he's never been asked about or had to answer for. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2034.1399999999999s)]
*  He then gave a Ukrainian Nazi. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2040.02s)]
*  Yeah. Then he gave a [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2041.6599999999999s)]
*  a tongue bath to the biggest blood sold war criminals of my lifetime, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2043.78s)]
*  Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2048.14s)]
*  He did that interview. That was just disgusting. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2049.9s)]
*  And then he did a vaccine panel during covid where he brought on four vaccine [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2052.42s)]
*  liars, not one skeptic. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2056.22s)]
*  He didn't bring on anybody with a [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2057.66s)]
*  counter narrative to just lie about vaccines and covid and not. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2058.86s)]
*  So he was doing all these things to try to get back in good grade. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2063.1000000000004s)]
*  That's my theory. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2066.7000000000003s)]
*  That's why you ask him what happened to Michael Moore. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2067.54s)]
*  I think you get ostracized and he doesn't want to get ostracized. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2069.54s)]
*  And then who knows the money the money dries up for your next movie. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2072.42s)]
*  Who knows what that but definitely doesn't make any sense. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2075.6200000000003s)]
*  That's that's actually that makes sense that I'd love to ask him. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2078.5s)]
*  But, you know, he'll never come on my show. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2082.38s)]
*  I feel like I think it's a great explanation. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2084.34s)]
*  Probably right. I mean, I think it's probably as simple as that. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2086.3s)]
*  You know, the desire not to be. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2088.42s)]
*  I mean, I know what it feels like to be shunned. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2089.98s)]
*  I know. Right. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2091.86s)]
*  I mean, people I've known all my life speak of me in the most despicable ways. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2092.86s)]
*  And it's because I actually kept true to my values. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2097.1s)]
*  I actually, you know, I look forward to a day when the left actually [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2101.14s)]
*  criticizes and is skeptical of big pharma and is adversarial towards the government [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2104.94s)]
*  and the captured regulatory agencies and the liars inside government [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2110.86s)]
*  like Fauci and Collins and all those people. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2115.06s)]
*  I look forward to those days when we stand up against the CIA again [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2118.06s)]
*  and don't believe the FBI in the intelligence communities, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2121.66s)]
*  which has infiltrated every lefty organization and dismantled them. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2124.5s)]
*  I look forward to those days when they come back. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2128.1s)]
*  I've never left them. They did. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2130.54s)]
*  They became neocon right wingers. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2132.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't know if that's even the right term anymore to call it. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2134.58s)]
*  But that's what the people who think they're liberal now are now. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2136.8999999999996s)]
*  They know they're pro-war, they're anti-free speech, they're pro-censorship, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2140.62s)]
*  they're anti-bodily autonomy, and now they're excusing a genocide. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2145.22s)]
*  They're the exact opposite of what they think they are. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2148.98s)]
*  That's just I could not improve on that. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2152.3799999999997s)]
*  Can I just take you back to something you said a moment ago [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2154.98s)]
*  about the 2016 election in Bernie Sanders? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2158.8199999999997s)]
*  And Sanders was clearly and was also true in 2020, the Democratic candidate [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2164.74s)]
*  in the primaries with grassroots support. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2169.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, he was with actual people behind him, right? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2171.8599999999997s)]
*  And he had a message that was distinct from all other messages [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2174.5s)]
*  in the Democratic coalition. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2177.46s)]
*  And Russia gated him. OK. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2179.38s)]
*  So I think looking back when historians untangle this, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2181.5s)]
*  you know, this mess that we've been living in for nine years [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2186.14s)]
*  and trying to figure out what actually happened, like, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2188.42s)]
*  how did we wind up at war with Russia? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2190.18s)]
*  A hot war with Russia, which we're in now. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2192.18s)]
*  Yeah. I think they're going to trace it back to the leak of the DNC emails. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2193.94s)]
*  I just have always felt that. What was that? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2199.1s)]
*  So, well, we know that. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2201.86s)]
*  So it used to be that remember when George Bush said he met Putin [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2205.78s)]
*  and he looked into his soul and he's a good man? Yes. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2208.86s)]
*  And that's because there was, you know, we wanted to export our crony [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2211.46s)]
*  capitalism to Russia, which we did in a big way. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2215.26s)]
*  And there was economic interests in Russia. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2218.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, then the war machine had economic interests. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2222.5400000000004s)]
*  And we needed we need a boogeyman again. Right. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2224.98s)]
*  And I remember when when Biden was pulling out of Afghanistan [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2227.58s)]
*  and there was a lot of people who consider themselves liberal [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2232.26s)]
*  that were giving him congratulations. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2235.46s)]
*  Look, he's getting out. He's getting out. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2237.42s)]
*  And I was like, well, wait a minute. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2239.5s)]
*  What is he going to do with the money that we've been spending in Afghanistan? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2241.26s)]
*  Has he said, well, I'm going to wait till I hear because I'm pretty sure [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2245.1000000000004s)]
*  they have another war in the chamber if they're going to let him end this one. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2249.1400000000003s)]
*  And exactly they did. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2252.78s)]
*  They had the Ukraine war in the chamber, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2254.06s)]
*  which they had been preparing for for at least a decade, if not longer. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2256.02s)]
*  And then again, that's the Rachel Maddow, Anderson Cooper, even. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2260.58s)]
*  They're never going to tell you that, oh, that's right. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2265.9s)]
*  The CIA got in bed with right wing Nazis in Ukraine to overthrow [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2268.82s)]
*  their democratically elected government. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2272.14s)]
*  Why? For economic reasons. That's why. Why? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2273.94s)]
*  Because, oh, because the Ukraine wanted to. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2277.18s)]
*  They had a better economic deal from Putin and Russia [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2280.1s)]
*  than they were getting from the European Union. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2282.62s)]
*  And that cannot stand. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2284.34s)]
*  And so we we overthrew their democratically elected president. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2286.0600000000004s)]
*  Then we Zelensky's a puppet. Right. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2290.1800000000003s)]
*  And he ran on peace. That's the irony. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2292.6200000000003s)]
*  So he ran on peace and ending war. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2294.82s)]
*  And now he's banning newspapers and opposition parties [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2297.02s)]
*  and going into Christian churches. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2300.9s)]
*  And you've seen it all. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2303.02s)]
*  And, you know, killing American journalists. Right. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2304.7400000000002s)]
*  He's not elected. He's a dictator. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2307.54s)]
*  And he's a by definition. Exactly. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2309.2200000000003s)]
*  So they'll never tell you about the Minsk Accords [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2311.66s)]
*  and that they had peace agreements and that as Angela Merkel revealed, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2314.9s)]
*  that they never the Ukraine and the NATO never intended to abide by the peace. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2319.9s)]
*  So what happened after we overthrew the government in Ukraine [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2324.82s)]
*  in 2014 was the people, the Russian speaking ethnics [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2329.1800000000003s)]
*  in the east part of Ukraine didn't want to go along with that coup government. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2332.78s)]
*  And so the Ukrainian government, Nazi started bombing them. Right. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2336.1800000000003s)]
*  They started shelling them, which is why we had to have peace agreements. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2340.3s)]
*  Minsk one and two accords. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2343.02s)]
*  And Angela Merkel revealed that they never meant to go along with those. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2344.7400000000002s)]
*  They just use that as a time to build up the Ukrainian military [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2348.2200000000003s)]
*  to get ready for a war with Russia that they were going to provoke, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2351.82s)]
*  which everyone knows that they did provoke. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2354.86s)]
*  They certainly did provoke it. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2356.86s)]
*  And I don't think everyone knows that, but I'll just say it again. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2358.46s)]
*  They provoked it using Kamala Harris at the Munich Security Conference. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2360.9s)]
*  When she said that you were going to put them in, you were going to put Ukraine and NATO. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2364.6200000000003s)]
*  That was the final straw. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2368.3399999999997s)]
*  And there was, you know, all Putin wanted was, hey, just don't do that. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2369.74s)]
*  I can't have you putting nuclear weapons and I can't have a NATO right on my border. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2372.62s)]
*  And you could everybody can anyway. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2377.46s)]
*  And so they but the way it's told in the United States is that Putin is an evil [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2379.5s)]
*  dictator and he just woke up one day and decided to invade Ukraine for kicks [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2383.8199999999997s)]
*  because he's just evil and they don't have any. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2388.2599999999998s)]
*  And then, of course, he blew up his own pipeline, the Nord Stream pipeline, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2390.94s)]
*  the biggest and which actually screws over Europe and Germany. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2395.1000000000004s)]
*  All right. Now their economies are all hurting because of that. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2398.94s)]
*  And Putin's economy is outgrowing, growing faster than the United States. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2401.9s)]
*  Exactly. And I believe I was called a traitor for pointing that out, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2405.82s)]
*  but it doesn't make it any less true. It's a fact. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2409.3s)]
*  But this is all and this is so frustrating, this kind of propaganda. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2411.78s)]
*  And because I have the time to look into this and I'm aware of it [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2415.3s)]
*  and I can't keep my mouth shut about it. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2419.7000000000003s)]
*  Now, you know, everybody calls me a right winger. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2421.9s)]
*  People say I'm turning Democrats into Republicans and stuff like this. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2424.38s)]
*  Like, no, I'm trying to wake up Democrats and Republicans to the uniparty [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2428.46s)]
*  that's been running things. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2432.5s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're living in, you know. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2433.58s)]
*  And and, you know, it's it's funny. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2435.9s)]
*  I'm noting some kind of kind of a pattern. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2438.06s)]
*  Every war, there seems to be some kind of in every coup we do. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2441.86s)]
*  There seems to be some kind of natural resource that we actually are after [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2445.54s)]
*  in an economic gain, just like, well, Lindsey Graham just said it, that [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2448.74s)]
*  there's eleven trillion dollars in rare earth minerals under Ukraine. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2453.54s)]
*  He just blurted out like his boyfriend's name on Valentine's Day. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2457.18s)]
*  And there it is. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2460.8599999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, nobody ever talked about this for the first three, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2462.46s)]
*  four years of this war. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2465.5s)]
*  All of a sudden, he's like, oh, it's all about eleven trillion dollars in rare. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2466.7s)]
*  Like you son of a bitch. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2470.22s)]
*  And they just say it. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2471.46s)]
*  They just say it out loud. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2472.8599999999997s)]
*  And there's no media there to hold him accountable because the media is now [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2474.22s)]
*  owned by billionaires like Jeff Bezos. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2477.26s)]
*  And they they don't hire journalists from blue collar backgrounds. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2479.5800000000004s)]
*  They hire journalists from Ivy League schools who are going to be class loyal. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2482.9s)]
*  They don't have to tell them what to say. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2487.46s)]
*  Exactly. Who are going to be class loyal, boy. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2489.34s)]
*  We've told you before about Hallow. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2492.0600000000004s)]
*  It is a great app that I am proud to say I use. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2494.34s)]
*  My whole family uses it's for daily prayer and Christian meditation. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2498.0600000000004s)]
*  And it's transformative. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2501.6200000000003s)]
*  So with everything happening in the world right now, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2503.46s)]
*  it is essential to ground yourself. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2506.02s)]
*  This is not some quack cure. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2509.54s)]
*  This is the oldest and most reliable cure in history. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2512.66s)]
*  It's rare. Ground yourself in prayer and scripture every single day. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2516.18s)]
*  That is a prerequisite for staying sane and healthy and maybe for doing better [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2520.18s)]
*  eternally. So if you're busy on the road, headed to kids sports, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2525.22s)]
*  there is always time to pray and reflect alone or as a family. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2528.58s)]
*  But it's hard to be organized about it. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2532.14s)]
*  Building a foundation of prayer is going to be absolutely critical [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2534.9399999999996s)]
*  as we head into November, praying that God's will is done in this country [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2537.58s)]
*  and that peace and healing come to us here in the United States and around the world. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2541.54s)]
*  Christianity obviously is under attack everywhere. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2546.22s)]
*  That's not an accident. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2550.74s)]
*  Why is Christianity, the most peaceful of all religions, under attack globally? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2551.9399999999996s)]
*  Did you see the opening of the Paris Olympics? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2555.98s)]
*  There's a reason because the battle is not temporal. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2558.06s)]
*  It's taking place in the unseen world. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2561.14s)]
*  It's a spiritual battle, obviously. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2563.78s)]
*  So try Hallow. Get three months completely free at Hallow. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2566.6200000000003s)]

*  If there is ever a time to get spiritually in tune and ground yourself in prayer, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2573.0600000000004s)]
*  it's now. Hallow will help personally and strongly and totally [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2577.02s)]
*  sincerely recommended. Hallow.com slash Tucker. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2582.02s)]
*  So I'm fixated on this question of the DNC emails [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2585.5800000000004s)]
*  winding up with Wikileaks and Julian Assange. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2591.46s)]
*  We were told that Russia did that. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2594.18s)]
*  The FBI was never allowed in. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2596.9s)]
*  The US government never actually. Crowd strike. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2598.66s)]
*  Crowd strike. Right. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2600.86s)]
*  Told us that. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2602.62s)]
*  And we were just beaten the face with that line for the next three years. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2603.58s)]
*  And it was on the basis of that supposed crime that Russia became our biggest enemy. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2607.58s)]
*  And we wound up in a hot war with Russia. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2613.06s)]
*  And my question to you is, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2614.9s)]
*  do you think those emails were stolen by Russia and given to Julian Assange? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2617.5s)]
*  He's denied that. Or do you think they were leaked to Wikileaks by a disgruntled [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2621.78s)]
*  DNC employee who saw the DNC cheating in the primary on behalf of Hillary Clinton [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2626.34s)]
*  and against Bernie Sanders to shut down democracy within the party? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2632.42s)]
*  So that DNC email leak being blamed on Russia served two purposes. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2637.06s)]
*  Right. You get to tie [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2643.62s)]
*  Donald Trump to Russia. Right. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2646.1s)]
*  And then you get to demonize Russia. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2648.3399999999997s)]
*  Exactly. Which they had a war in the chamber for. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2651.02s)]
*  Right. They wanted they knew this was coming. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2654.38s)]
*  So it served both purposes. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2656.7s)]
*  And do I think that so we know Russia I had on Bill Binney, who at the time [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2658.62s)]
*  was the number one code breaker for the NSA for decades. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2664.58s)]
*  And of course, he told the truth. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2669.02s)]
*  So the FBI tried to imprison him. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2670.86s)]
*  But he's smarter than the FBI, which isn't that hard. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2673.3399999999997s)]
*  And so he outwitted them. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2676.2599999999998s)]
*  The FBI tried to imprison Bill Binney. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2677.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they tried to they tried to get him. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2680.1s)]
*  But he outsmarted them. Right. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2682.74s)]
*  He told the story on my show. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2683.98s)]
*  I don't I don't remember the details because it was in 2016. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2685.54s)]
*  Basically, he was just in one sentence. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2688.5s)]
*  Binney is very familiar with how information moves digitally, said, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2690.98s)]
*  made the case mathematically that it would be impossible to leak it [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2694.66s)]
*  from outside the building and have someone downloading it from. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2699.2599999999998s)]
*  He said it had to be downloaded. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2702.1s)]
*  And he said, because they were there would be there's a paper. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2704.02s)]
*  There would be a trail of, you know, electronic trail that you would see [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2706.7s)]
*  if that information got downloaded and went. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2711.2599999999998s)]
*  So he said that had to be locally downloaded. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2713.94s)]
*  Right. Like. And so then it comes up Seth Rich. Right. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2718.42s)]
*  So you always can tell when the establishment is up to some fuckery [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2723.02s)]
*  when they don't allow you to ask questions about something [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2728.7s)]
*  like you weren't allowed to ask questions about covid. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2731.18s)]
*  So, you know, sums up. Right. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2733.22s)]
*  Percent. So that's true in our personal lives, too. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2734.7799999999997s)]
*  If I don't if I refuse to talk about something, there's probably something there. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2737.54s)]
*  So I first experienced this when it came to Seth Rich. Right. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2740.2599999999998s)]
*  So I remember that there was a private investigator that was hired, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2744.62s)]
*  I don't know, by the family or someone connected to the Seth Rich family. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2748.1s)]
*  And he gave a press conference. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2751.62s)]
*  And all I did was cover his press conference. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2753.58s)]
*  And I asked logical questions like, hey, if this was a botched robbery, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2756.66s)]
*  how come they didn't steal his watch or his wallet or anything? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2760.82s)]
*  How come there's where's the videotape of this? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2764.3s)]
*  There's cameras everywhere. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2766.38s)]
*  Hey, how where was he when the time he left the bar to the time he got to his house? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2767.6200000000003s)]
*  There's hours in between there. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2772.02s)]
*  Nobody I just want to know. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2773.26s)]
*  And I remember I was on a panel, a news panel, and I said, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2775.1800000000003s)]
*  can anybody remember the last time there was an unsolved murder in Washington, D.C. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2779.5800000000004s)]
*  and reporters weren't allowed to ask questions about it? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2785.26s)]
*  And that was just like, well, no, they don't want to talk about it. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2788.5s)]
*  They don't want. Of course, that's never happened before. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2791.5400000000004s)]
*  And it's never happened since. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2794.1800000000003s)]
*  And so I got the a hit piece put on me in the Washington Post [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2795.86s)]
*  because they called me a conspiracy theorist because I was asking logical [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2801.1400000000003s)]
*  questions about an unsolved murder. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2804.82s)]
*  How dare you in Washington, D.C. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2808.42s)]
*  I was put in a hit piece in the in the Washington Post. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2810.7400000000002s)]
*  And son of a bitch, a couple of years go by. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2814.26s)]
*  And now they've been. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2818.94s)]
*  First of all, the FBI said they didn't have his computer, Seth Rich's laptop. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2820.78s)]
*  Then they said, OK, yeah, we have it, but we can't access it. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2824.5s)]
*  They're like, OK, yeah, we accessed it, but we have a printout, but we can't share it. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2827.86s)]
*  And then a judge ordered them to release their findings of the [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2832.6200000000003s)]
*  what's inside that computer. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2836.58s)]
*  And they refuse. The judge ordered them again. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2838.1s)]
*  You have to do this. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2841.6600000000003s)]
*  And they said, I know where they invoke some national security thing. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2842.82s)]
*  And they and they said, we're not going to release it for 65 years. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2846.26s)]
*  That's what they said. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2849.6200000000003s)]
*  And I was like, he's a low level staffer at DNC. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2850.46s)]
*  Well, a bitch. I knew it. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2853.38s)]
*  There was something up. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2855.26s)]
*  And when the FBI is a good, I'm like, what did Seth Rich kill Kennedy? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2856.6600000000003s)]
*  Why won't they? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2860.2200000000003s)]
*  So and and and of course, now I was right to ask all those questions. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2862.82s)]
*  And so it certainly seems all the evidence points towards Seth Rich. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2867.98s)]
*  It doesn't point towards Russia because now we know that Russia didn't. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2872.3s)]
*  I knew that immediately. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2875.1000000000004s)]
*  I knew that in 2016 that that wasn't possible. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2876.1400000000003s)]
*  And they knew that that crowd strike was lying. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2878.7000000000003s)]
*  In fact, and that and that it was the Hillary Clinton campaign [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2880.5800000000004s)]
*  and the intelligence community that concocted [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2884.3s)]
*  the Russiagate conspiracy theory, which is one of the dumbest, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2887.54s)]
*  most easily debunked conspiracy theories of my life [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2890.6200000000003s)]
*  that was repeated ubiquitously in the press. Right. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2893.42s)]
*  Manufacturing consent. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2896.78s)]
*  And so the Steele dossier, you know, Hillary Clinton funded it. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2898.42s)]
*  Right. And we all know it was all made up. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2902.14s)]
*  And she lied about that, by the way. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2904.2599999999998s)]
*  She had to pay a fine for lying about that. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2907.22s)]
*  Nobody ever that can. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2911.2599999999998s)]
*  None. If it doesn't get reported in the press, it doesn't happen. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2912.14s)]
*  They decide what's the news and what is it. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2915.38s)]
*  And if it doesn't get reported, I mean, it got reported on page 17. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2917.38s)]
*  But nobody made a big deal out of it. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2921.22s)]
*  So that's what if you're asking me about the DNC leaked of the emails, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2923.1s)]
*  I think certainly the evidence doesn't point towards Russia whatsoever. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2928.6600000000003s)]
*  There never was any evidence. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2933.5s)]
*  And they lied about everything. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2935.3s)]
*  And there was I mean, I remember if this was like I'm not a Democrat, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2937.62s)]
*  have never been. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2941.58s)]
*  So a lot of this stuff was confusing to me. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2942.54s)]
*  And it was hard to it's hard to assess things as they happen. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2944.54s)]
*  And I feel like an idiot for not my instincts aligned with yours. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2947.5s)]
*  Exactly. I thought there's something there's lying here. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2951.02s)]
*  I know lying, but I'm not exactly sure what they're lying about. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2953.3s)]
*  And I don't know what the truth is. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2956.58s)]
*  But I remember that the Nation magazine, the oldest leftist magazine [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2958.42s)]
*  in the United States, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2962.46s)]
*  Victor Novasky's old magazine ran a piece by Bill Binney saying, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2964.38s)]
*  this is not Russia. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2968.3s)]
*  Russia did not do this. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2970.46s)]
*  And you look back eight years and the idea that the Nation magazine [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2971.86s)]
*  would write a piece like that, that's impossible to imagine now. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2977.06s)]
*  They would never do that. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2979.7000000000003s)]
*  It's like every institution on the left got captured by this weird [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2981.1800000000003s)]
*  neoliberal dishonesty. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2985.3s)]
*  And how did that happen? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2987.82s)]
*  Well, is that the so Aaron Maté [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2989.82s)]
*  did a meticulous debunking of the [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2995.86s)]
*  Russiagate conspiracy theory, and he was allowed to be printed. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=2999.02s)]
*  I think it was in the Nation. Oh, good. OK, good. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3002.6600000000003s)]
*  Boy, the editor, I think it's I think Vanden Heuvel. Katrina. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3005.54s)]
*  Yeah. And she caught a lot of guff for just it was the only time [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3010.1000000000004s)]
*  they printed anything counter to that narrative. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3015.22s)]
*  And Aaron Maté ended up winning the I.F. Stone Independent [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3017.8199999999997s)]
*  Journalism Award for that work. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3022.02s)]
*  And they said he meticulously debunked Russiagate. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3023.8999999999996s)]
*  It didn't. It Russiagate's a dumb conspiracy theory. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3026.7799999999997s)]
*  If you want to find the debunking of it, there it is. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3029.4599999999996s)]
*  It's it's it was given an award. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3032.06s)]
*  The the Izzy Award. Right. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3034.7799999999997s)]
*  But again, that doesn't make the front page of the Washington Post [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3036.3399999999997s)]
*  and The New York Times. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3039.2599999999998s)]
*  Now, Rachel Maddow's never going to tell you that she's just going to keep going on [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3040.3399999999997s)]
*  and Russiagating Russiagating because to tell the truth about Russiagate [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3043.5s)]
*  gets you ostracized and to lie about it, gets you a 30 million dollar contract, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3047.1s)]
*  which is what Rachel Maddow got, which is one hundred thousand dollars a day. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3051.74s)]
*  That's how much Rachel Maddow gets paid to lie to you about Ukraine, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3055.02s)]
*  about covid, about anything. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3059.02s)]
*  That's what she's there to lie about. Russiagate. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3061.3s)]
*  How long can that continue? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3063.38s)]
*  I mean, the audience for news organizations that lie [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3065.06s)]
*  all news organizations lie. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3069.7s)]
*  But, you know, you'd hope it's inadvertent. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3071.54s)]
*  It's a mistake. No, I've made a lot of those. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3073.78s)]
*  But the ones who lie on purpose, like NBC News or CBS or ABC, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3076.18s)]
*  Washington Post, New York Times, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3080.38s)]
*  like they are losing audience share as a result of their lying. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3082.18s)]
*  Can they continue? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3085.14s)]
*  Yeah, I don't see any end to it right now. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3087.9s)]
*  They keep inventing fake fact check organizations. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3090.3s)]
*  So I had like this, you know, CIA employee from NBC News [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3094.74s)]
*  contact me about me spreading misinformation. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3099.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, it's directly about you. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3103.1s)]
*  They said when you spread misinformation about me. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3104.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. That I said that I repeated the Russian propaganda [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3108.46s)]
*  that you were targeted for assassination by a Ukrainian. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3114.3399999999997s)]
*  And I went back and I looked at my coverage and I said, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3117.4199999999996s)]
*  the only thing we can say for sure is that this guy is being detained for questioning. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3121.3799999999997s)]
*  That's the only thing I didn't. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3126.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, NBC did that. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3128.02s)]
*  Yeah. I said, no, if you look at this and then I realized. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3129.5s)]
*  That story is true. Just by the way, I've never talked about it. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3132.7s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about it now, but it's just it's so interesting. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3135.34s)]
*  They never called me. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3137.86s)]
*  I would be the I was the target of that assassination attempt. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3139.1s)]
*  So you'd think that someone would ask me. They never did. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3141.46s)]
*  Who was this employee? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3143.86s)]
*  You know what? It's a woman and I can't think of her name, but I know she's been [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3145.46s)]
*  as I looked into it, I'm like, oh, other people have called her out [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3150.54s)]
*  for being the mouthpiece of this intelligence community. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3153.42s)]
*  And that's what her job. She's a fact checker. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3157.38s)]
*  She used to be a librarian. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3159.1800000000003s)]
*  And now she's a fact checker for NBC News. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3160.6600000000003s)]
*  Brandy Zadonzi or something like that. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3163.34s)]
*  She has like a Ukrainian sounding name. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3165.42s)]
*  And then I just got contacted then the next week [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3168.06s)]
*  was a place called Logically, Logically Fallacy or Logically False [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3171.7000000000003s)]
*  or some kind of international fact checking organization. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3177.02s)]
*  And I and they're saying, hey, you're spreading misinformation about this. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3180.78s)]
*  And it was a satirical piece I had done, one of them. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3183.98s)]
*  And it's so funny. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3187.26s)]
*  Do you guys know what's that's higher is anyway? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3188.46s)]
*  So I looked into who funds them, right? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3189.94s)]
*  Because that's the first thing you want to do is look into who funds them. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3192.82s)]
*  And they were started off by a grant from MIT, which we all know is CIA infested. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3195.42s)]
*  And then they got the Jeff Bezos, who's in bed with the CIA [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3199.98s)]
*  and wants to keep his two billions and billions of dollars of contracts with the CIA. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3204.62s)]
*  He also funded them. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3208.62s)]
*  And then their two big clients, the UK government and the United States government. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3210.06s)]
*  You're fact checking on behalf of the war machine. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3213.5s)]
*  That's what that is. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3217.06s)]
*  If you're by the way, if you're a government fact checker, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3218.86s)]
*  then you are by definition like a liar. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3221.7400000000002s)]
*  Lord, ha ha. You're like a stooge. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3224.5s)]
*  Yeah. You're Tokyo Rose. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3226.3s)]
*  You're a liar. I mean, you're not a liar. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3227.5s)]
*  You're a collaborator. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3229.38s)]
*  Baghdad, Bob. Yeah, Baghdad, Bob. Thank you. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3231.2200000000003s)]
*  That's what you are. That's what those people are. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3233.46s)]
*  So what the the what I realized, what was happening [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3235.14s)]
*  and it kind of scared me was that, oh, they're trying to get me. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3238.54s)]
*  They're going to try and Russell Brand me. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3242.1s)]
*  They're going to try to get me the platform [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3243.54s)]
*  so they can have all these articles about Jimmy Dore spreading misinformation. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3245.66s)]
*  And they can put and then so then YouTube will go, oh, well, look at all this. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3249.54s)]
*  We got to get rid of this guy. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3253.02s)]
*  Look at all these fact checking organizations, which they did the same thing. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3254.18s)]
*  So Facebook demonetized me because, you know, the big pharma [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3258.02s)]
*  funded fact checking organizations, which is funded by the Johnson and Johnson. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3262.02s)]
*  They said I was spreading misinformation about [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3266.74s)]
*  COVID, which not nothing. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3270.0200000000004s)]
*  None of it was ever misinformation was all information. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3272.38s)]
*  Again, you don't get in trouble for telling for lying. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3274.78s)]
*  You get in trouble for telling the truth, which is what they did. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3277.6200000000003s)]
*  They would they would write these, I mean, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3280.1800000000003s)]
*  20,000 word essays about how I lied about something. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3283.1400000000003s)]
*  And it just came down to they didn't like my headline. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3287.2200000000003s)]
*  They quibbled with my headline. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3289.0200000000004s)]
*  That's that's called a quibble. That's not a fact check. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3290.42s)]
*  Not one fact I got wrong. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3292.7400000000002s)]
*  But then Facebook used that as, hey, you know, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3294.5s)]
*  they put a label on my story. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3297.74s)]
*  This is misinformation. You better not share it. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3299.54s)]
*  You better not even read it. You're going to get in trouble. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3301.7799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, and then now Zuckerberg has come out and apologize. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3304.5s)]
*  Yeah, I was pressured to do all this censoring and they're still doing it. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3308.98s)]
*  They're not stopping. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3312.5s)]
*  Like, I don't know why he even did that, but they're still doing it. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3313.42s)]
*  They still have those fake fact check organizations. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3316.5s)]
*  And if you look into them, they're being funded by a billionaire [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3319.18s)]
*  or they're with a political agenda or by a big pharma or a corporation [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3322.14s)]
*  somewhere that has a political agenda. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3326.38s)]
*  They're not anybody calls themselves a fact checker is a liar. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3328.3s)]
*  They're paid liars. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3331.34s)]
*  Of course, the irony is, it's always exactly the opposite of what they're telling you. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3333.9s)]
*  Yes. And if you if you get your money from the government to fact check, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3339.1s)]
*  that the biggest liars are always the government. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3344.2200000000003s)]
*  Of course, the second biggest liars is the corporate media. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3346.34s)]
*  And third in a distant third are randos on social media. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3349.1400000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3352.66s)]
*  That's so true. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3355.5s)]
*  I think anyone who uses the term misinformation, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3356.7s)]
*  not ironically, is is part of the problem. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3359.8999999999996s)]
*  And because that's not a real category, there are only two categories, true or false. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3362.94s)]
*  Inconvenient for the people in power is not a meaningful category to me. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3367.46s)]
*  I don't give a shit whether it's inconvenient for them. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3370.66s)]
*  Isn't that what? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3372.66s)]
*  Isn't it? One of them disinformation, I think, is it might be true, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3373.66s)]
*  but it's inconvenient for the establishment or miss it. All of them. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3377.8599999999997s)]
*  It's true or false? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3381.5s)]
*  Is it a lie or is it true? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3382.62s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3384.46s)]
*  And it's, you know, when you start expanding the categories, it's like the genders. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3386.22s)]
*  I'm sorry. Just like you get into fantasy, but it's fantasy [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3390.18s)]
*  concocted to protect the people in charge. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3395.14s)]
*  I mean, so do you do you feel it feels to me just being in New York last night, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3398.38s)]
*  like things are changing and Trump is at the, you know, the apex of of the pyramid. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3403.42s)]
*  But I'm not sure how much it's about Trump. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3408.58s)]
*  Maybe it is. Maybe it's not. I'm not really sure. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3410.46s)]
*  But I've noticed a lot of people who seem to have decided, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3412.42s)]
*  I'm just going to say what I think, and I don't care anymore. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3415.42s)]
*  Do you feel that? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3417.98s)]
*  What what I will say is that when Bobby Kennedy [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3421.3s)]
*  joined Donald Trump and he did that at a and I think it was Glendale, Arizona, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3426.14s)]
*  he got introduced and he was up there talking about ending the billionaire [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3431.5s)]
*  billion dollar funded wars and investing that money back at home. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3435.98s)]
*  He was talking about cleaning up our water supply and cleaning up our food supply [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3440.3399999999997s)]
*  and getting the corruption out of our captured agencies, the CDC, the FDA. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3444.9399999999996s)]
*  He was talking about taking on big agra. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3450.06s)]
*  He was talking about confronting our obesity epidemic [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3452.2599999999998s)]
*  and the chronic illness that's been exploding. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3456.14s)]
*  And there was a whether you think Donald Trump is [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3459.46s)]
*  is serious about letting Bobby take over that agenda or not. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3463.62s)]
*  What was really interesting to me was that was a stadium [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3467.06s)]
*  full of Republican voters who were cheering that stuff on. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3470.8199999999997s)]
*  That's right. And that's traditionally that's supposed to be a Democrat. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3474.46s)]
*  When was the last time you heard a Democratic politician [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3477.62s)]
*  talking about the captured regulatory agencies? Right. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3479.3799999999997s)]
*  These are these are things that the Democrat these are what I would consider [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3483.3799999999997s)]
*  lefty issues. So what this message there that's what really scares [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3486.8599999999997s)]
*  the establishment, Tucker, is for a guy like me to see that and people [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3490.66s)]
*  who agree with that message to see a room full of Republican voters [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3494.34s)]
*  also agree with that message. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3497.98s)]
*  And we're like, hey, well, maybe we're not that different. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3499.6600000000003s)]
*  Maybe we do have more in common and we share a common enemy. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3501.94s)]
*  And that enemy is the oligarchy and the establishment [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3505.2200000000003s)]
*  that has been crushing us and poisoning us at the behest of big pharma [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3507.86s)]
*  and corporations and big agra for the last 50 years. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3511.3s)]
*  They don't want us to realize that, you know, when Kamala Harris, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3514.7400000000002s)]
*  when Dick Cheney endorses, she says, oh, you know, we have more in common [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3517.58s)]
*  than divided. She doesn't mean she has more in common with workers. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3521.8599999999997s)]
*  She doesn't mean she has more in common with regular people or students [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3524.8599999999997s)]
*  or that she means she has more in common with neocon Republicans. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3528.06s)]
*  She doesn't mean that we share they share a common enemy. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3532.46s)]
*  They are the common enemy. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3535.3399999999997s)]
*  And so that's what I'll say about that. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3537.18s)]
*  And I see, you know, I have a red line. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3540.14s)]
*  I wish Donald Trump, you know, I was talking with Chris Hedges. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3544.8199999999997s)]
*  I was interviewed on his show and we were talking about how, you know, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3549.34s)]
*  if it's Kamala Harris, it's Donald Trump. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3553.1000000000004s)]
*  The same thing's happening in Palestine and Gaza. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3555.1000000000004s)]
*  And I said, you know, a weird thing is and is that [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3558.94s)]
*  someone's trying to kill Donald Trump and it looks like it's the deep state. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3564.1800000000003s)]
*  And so he must be a problem somehow. Right. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3567.6200000000003s)]
*  So that so that I go, that gives me hope. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3571.6600000000003s)]
*  In a weird way, I go, they're trying to kill him. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3574.6200000000003s)]
*  So that's got to mean something. Right. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3577.54s)]
*  I definitely agree with that. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3580.02s)]
*  And they're not trying to kill her and they're not trying to kill Joe Biden. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3582.06s)]
*  And so that's got to be something. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3585.6600000000003s)]
*  The establishment has a very, very I think they're unimpressive and [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3588.06s)]
*  they've done nothing to help our society. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3592.7000000000003s)]
*  And I mean that. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3594.54s)]
*  But the one thing they're really good at is sniffing out who means it, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3595.58s)]
*  who's a threat. Their threat assessment is unerring. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3598.5s)]
*  They know like they look at AOC, who's like power to the people, power to the workers. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3601.7000000000003s)]
*  And they're like, oh, yeah, she's one of us. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3605.86s)]
*  Like, they know that's a lie. They know she doesn't mean it. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3607.38s)]
*  And they look at someone like Tulsi, who's like, you know, liberal [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3610.5s)]
*  chick from Hawaii. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3614.6600000000003s)]
*  And they look at her and they're like, no, actually, you can't be in our party. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3616.38s)]
*  Like, they could just feel, you know what I mean? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3620.38s)]
*  And the fact they want it almost doesn't matter what you say. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3622.0200000000004s)]
*  They they're like animals. And I mean, this is a compliment. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3625.6200000000003s)]
*  They they detect the aroma like they know who's a threat. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3628.5400000000004s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3632.42s)]
*  Trying to kill Trump is like [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3633.82s)]
*  it's established as Bonifides in my mind. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3635.6200000000003s)]
*  You know, you bring up Tulsi and [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3637.78s)]
*  people forget what happened. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3641.82s)]
*  She was a darling of the Democratic Party. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3643.42s)]
*  Vice chair of DNC when she got to Washington. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3645.46s)]
*  And then she decided to support. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3647.5400000000004s)]
*  She she didn't like the corporate money inside the party. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3649.6600000000003s)]
*  And she decided to support Bernie Sanders. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3652.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Which made her hated by half the party that supported. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3654.5800000000004s)]
*  So there was half the party supported Bernie, half the half the Democratic [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3658.1000000000004s)]
*  primary voters supported Bernie, half supported Hillary Clinton. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3661.54s)]
*  So that half the party hated her. Right. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3666.02s)]
*  And then she went on to tell the truth about the Syrian war. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3668.38s)]
*  Yes. And tell the truth about the rest of our four choice wars [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3671.66s)]
*  of economic interest. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3676.42s)]
*  And she lost the red. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3677.98s)]
*  Then she ran against Joe Biden and she ran against Bernie. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3679.38s)]
*  So now the Bernie supporters turn on her, too. And [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3682.9s)]
*  that that's why so people need to remember what happened with that. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3687.5s)]
*  I just try to remind people. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3691.3s)]
*  And now I disagree with Tulsi's view on a lot of things. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3692.98s)]
*  Israel is the big one. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3698.5s)]
*  But I don't I don't forget why people they again, just like with you, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3700.5s)]
*  they she got in trouble because she told the truth about Syria, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3704.94s)]
*  because she told the truth about Ukraine, because she told the truth [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3708.1000000000004s)]
*  about the Democratic Party cheating Bernie Sanders and the corporate control [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3711.1000000000004s)]
*  of their party. That was again, you don't get in trouble for lying. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3714.3s)]
*  She got in trouble for telling the truth. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3717.3s)]
*  That is absolutely right. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3719.94s)]
*  And they knew they could smell it on her right away. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3721.2200000000003s)]
*  She got back from that trip to see Assad and I was so out of it. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3723.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like, what's wrong with that? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3726.58s)]
*  She's on the Foreign Relations Committee. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3728.02s)]
*  Oh, exactly. And she wasn't. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3729.54s)]
*  I mean, I don't I never understood why we were against Assad in the first place. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3731.86s)]
*  I never had strong feelings about Assad. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3735.14s)]
*  He protected the Christians in Syria. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3736.86s)]
*  I don't know. That seemed like a good reason to at least be neutral. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3739.3s)]
*  Whatever. I just didn't. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3742.58s)]
*  I wasn't that interested in the topic. I'm American, right? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3743.5s)]
*  So it's not my world. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3745.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm not living in the Levant in my head. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3747.7400000000002s)]
*  But when she did that, I remember, I mean, they were just like, no, we [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3750.2200000000003s)]
*  that they hated her more than they hated any Republican. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3754.1800000000003s)]
*  I was really struck by that. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3757.78s)]
*  So, you know, there's a theory that the reason why the Syrian war happened [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3758.6600000000003s)]
*  was because they wanted to put a pipeline from was it Qatar or Saudi Arabia [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3762.98s)]
*  and right through Syria. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3768.5400000000004s)]
*  And of course, Syria was aligned with Russia and they wanted. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3769.9s)]
*  And so they wanted to get rid of Assad so they could do that. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3773.26s)]
*  And, you know, the CIA was backing, you know, ISIS and Al Qaeda, actually [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3776.06s)]
*  literally funding them right in a dirty war in Syria. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3782.2599999999998s)]
*  Right. One of the most expensive, dirty wars they've ever done. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3786.02s)]
*  And it was all of course. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3789.06s)]
*  And without question, the most immoral funding, ISIS and Al Qaeda. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3790.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes. You're not on our side. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3793.9399999999996s)]
*  No. And yet our government did that with our money. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3795.66s)]
*  And Tulsi is, if I'm recalling this correctly, sponsored a piece of legislation [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3798.14s)]
*  that basically just said we're not allowed to use US tax dollars to fund ISIS. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3802.82s)]
*  They were like, shut up, extremists. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3806.82s)]
*  Right winger. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3810.06s)]
*  That was insane. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3811.2200000000003s)]
*  So what happens? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3813.54s)]
*  I mean, it was so bad, Tucker, in Syria, that the Pentagon would be funding [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3815.1800000000003s)]
*  one terrorist organization and the CIA would be funding another terrorist [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3820.38s)]
*  organization, and then they would fight each other inside Syria. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3824.78s)]
*  And how do I know that? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3827.78s)]
*  Because it got printed in the L.A. Times. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3828.5800000000004s)]
*  That's how obvious it was. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3830.1400000000003s)]
*  But again, that doesn't that it's not it's on page 37. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3831.62s)]
*  It's not on page one. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3834.7s)]
*  It's not the lead story of the news. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3835.8599999999997s)]
*  In fact, it never makes the TV news. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3837.42s)]
*  And all they do is show you pictures of them [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3839.5s)]
*  cutting the guy's head off with a butcher's kitchen knife. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3842.58s)]
*  You remember when that was the big thing on cable? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3844.74s)]
*  I remember I'm watching Chris Matthews and they would show [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3846.8599999999997s)]
*  an ISIS guy cutting someone's head off with a kitchen knife. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3850.2999999999997s)]
*  And Chris Matthews like the president's got to do something. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3853.46s)]
*  He's got to do so. That's exactly how propaganda works. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3856.02s)]
*  And they're like, look, they're barbarians. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3858.8199999999997s)]
*  And my response was, yeah, why don't they blow their heads off [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3860.26s)]
*  with a nice Christian bomb made by Christians in a Christian bomb factory? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3863.1800000000003s)]
*  Because that's what Jesus would do. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3866.7000000000003s)]
*  We did an interview with a woman called Casey Means. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3868.2200000000003s)]
*  She's a Stanford educated surgeon [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3871.6600000000003s)]
*  and really one of the most remarkable people I have ever met. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3874.42s)]
*  In the interview, she explained how the food that we eat produced by [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3878.1400000000003s)]
*  huge food companies, big food in conjunction with pharma [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3883.0600000000004s)]
*  is destroying our health, making this a weak and sick country. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3887.42s)]
*  The levels of chronic disease are beyond belief. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3891.42s)]
*  What Casey Means, who we've not stopped thinking about ever since, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3895.38s)]
*  is the co-founder of a health care technology company called Levels. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3899.5s)]
*  And we are proud to announce today that we are partnering with Levels. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3903.3s)]
*  And by proud, I mean, sincerely proud. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3906.78s)]
*  Levels is a really interesting company and a great product. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3909.7000000000003s)]
*  It gives you insight into what's going on inside your body, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3912.82s)]
*  your metabolic health. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3916.02s)]
*  It helps you understand how the food that you're eating, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3917.58s)]
*  the things that you're doing every single day are affecting your body in real time. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3920.02s)]
*  You put stuff in your mouth, speaking for myself anyway, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3924.42s)]
*  and you don't think about it. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3928.62s)]
*  You have no idea what you're putting in your mouth [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3929.58s)]
*  and you have no idea what it's doing to your body. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3930.94s)]
*  But over time, you feel weak and tired and spacey. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3932.58s)]
*  And over an even longer period of time, you can get really sick. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3937.58s)]
*  So it's worth knowing what the food you eat is doing to you. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3940.34s)]
*  The Levels app works with something called the Continuous Glucose Monitor, a CGM. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3945.14s)]
*  You can get one as part of the plan or you can bring your own. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3950.14s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3952.2999999999997s)]
*  But the bottom line is big tech, big pharma and big food [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3953.66s)]
*  combined together to form an incredibly malevolent force, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3958.42s)]
*  pumping you full of garbage on healthy food with artificial sugars [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3963.18s)]
*  and hurting you and hurting the entire country. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3967.2999999999997s)]
*  So with Levels, you'll be able to see immediately what all this is doing to you. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3969.2999999999997s)]
*  You get access to real time personalized data, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3973.5s)]

*  Those of us who like Oreos can tell you firsthand. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3978.58s)]
*  This isn't talking to your doctor and annual physical, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3981.9399999999996s)]
*  looking backwards about things you did in the past. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3984.58s)]
*  This is up to the second information on how your body is responding [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3987.14s)]
*  to different foods and activities, the things that give you stress, your sleep, etc, etc. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=3991.8199999999997s)]

*  and you can make much better choices about how you feel. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4001.02s)]
*  And over time, it'll have a huge effect. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4003.98s)]
*  Right now, you can get an additional two free months [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4006.22s)]
*  when you go to levels.link.tucker. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4008.78s)]
*  That's levels.link.tucker. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4011.38s)]
*  This is the beginning of what we hope will be a long and happy partnership [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4014.38s)]
*  with Levels and Dr. Casey Means. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4018.62s)]
*  Can I just ask, I don't want to get too far afield, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4020.78s)]
*  but since you've been watching this stuff for so long, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4022.86s)]
*  whatever happened to Chris Matthews? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4025.94s)]
*  He was like a dutiful soldier for the Democratic Party. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4027.34s)]
*  But why? I mean, I worked in television my whole life. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4030.02s)]
*  So I know for a fact that a lot of people could have been me, too. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4032.98s)]
*  But it was Chris Matthews and they just crushed him in one day. Why? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4035.7799999999997s)]
*  I saw I found a video. It's a good question. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4039.3399999999997s)]
*  I found a video of him on, I think, election night. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4042.54s)]
*  Some election night. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4046.42s)]
*  And Rachel Maddow sitting there saying, you know, the Trump's victory, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4047.8199999999997s)]
*  the Republican victory is all about racism and hatred and racism. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4051.8199999999997s)]
*  And he was like, no, you know, if you go through Wisconsin [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4055.66s)]
*  and you see that the diners close and there's this thing and the people [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4058.22s)]
*  and the guy and he made an economic case for what was happening. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4061.7s)]
*  And I was like, that's what happened. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4065.2599999999998s)]
*  That's what happened. Amazing. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4068.2599999999998s)]
*  As he actually slipped up and told the truth once. Right. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4069.8599999999997s)]
*  Just like John Stewart, when he slipped up and told you the truth [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4072.8999999999996s)]
*  about the covid virus, then I guess Chris Matthews didn't get his mind [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4075.3799999999997s)]
*  right or they had to make an example out of them, because that's what that was. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4079.1s)]
*  Fascinating. Oh, I'm so glad I asked that question. Yeah. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4082.14s)]
*  So there's a zero tolerance policy for certain truths. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4084.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, absolute zero tolerance. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4087.34s)]
*  Like you can spend 40 years if you're Chris Matthews [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4088.98s)]
*  carrying water for a bunch of dumb politicians pretty reliably. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4092.02s)]
*  And then you say one thing about economics. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4097.18s)]
*  That's true. And you're done. Yeah. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4100.78s)]
*  And or look at, you know, look at Mehdi Hassan. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4102.66s)]
*  He thought he was insulated because he lied about the Syrian war. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4104.860000000001s)]
*  He lied about the Ukraine war. He lied about covid. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4108.58s)]
*  He lied about Russia gate. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4111.5s)]
*  He did all that for the establishment. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4113.1s)]
*  So he thought that had bottomed some [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4114.9s)]
*  a little insulation to tell a little truth about Palestine. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4117.339999999999s)]
*  And he had no you're fired. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4120.54s)]
*  And that was that, you know, I'm talking about. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4122.86s)]
*  Of course I do. Yeah. And that was he's like, no, dummy. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4124.5s)]
*  You don't get to you don't get to tell even a little bit of truth, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4127.099999999999s)]
*  especially when that's consequential. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4129.66s)]
*  So do you think I mean, it just looks like if you look at the Rogan numbers, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4131.86s)]
*  for example, are your numbers, for example, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4135.62s)]
*  it does feel like the era of those news organizations, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4139.66s)]
*  which I will never stop being angry at because I worked at them. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4143.82s)]
*  But it does feel like their era is over. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4146.5s)]
*  Well, it's it's funny is that my numbers that keep going up on on rumble. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4149.0199999999995s)]
*  YouTube has I'm considered borderline content. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4154.54s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4158.34s)]
*  And so they have ratcheted down the algorithm on me, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4159.58s)]
*  even though I still managed to get between 15 and 20 million views a month. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4165.54s)]
*  I used to was I was getting 24 or 25. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4169.259999999999s)]
*  Now they've gotten me ratcheted down to 15. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4171.98s)]
*  And, you know, I remember I had a discussion with some people at YouTube [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4174.74s)]
*  and I'm like, hey, this is what's going on. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4179.46s)]
*  Is this is there anything I said? I'm on bended knee. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4182.78s)]
*  Is there anything I can do to get this to get off this [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4185.66s)]
*  algorithm that I've been put on out? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4189.58s)]
*  And it just got way worse during the election season. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4191.38s)]
*  And the response was, well, it's the election season. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4195.42s)]
*  And so, you know, everybody's numbers in this space are down. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4198.54s)]
*  I'm like, that's like saying I should be selling. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4201.58s)]
*  That's like saying I should be selling less, less, less toys during Christmas season. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4204.42s)]
*  Exactly. I mean, this is my numbers should be going through less ice cream in August. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4209.5s)]
*  So, I mean, I understand it's it's it's YouTube got the hell scared out of them in 2017 [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4212.42s)]
*  because we we are a threat. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4218.58s)]
*  Like now you're independent. I'm independent. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4221.54s)]
*  We are a threat to The New York Times, to MSNBC. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4223.74s)]
*  We do get more higher ratings and so says C. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4226.54s)]
*  Joe Rogan. That's why they come at him so hard. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4229.0599999999995s)]
*  Is is because we're a threat to their business model. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4231.46s)]
*  So they have to discredit us. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4233.9400000000005s)]
*  And the way they do it is they scare the advertisers away from shows like ours. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4235.14s)]
*  Right. That's the I mean, there's a story that just came out. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4240.14s)]
*  That's how they wanted to the Labor Party in the UK had a plan to kill Elon Musk's [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4242.54s)]
*  Twitter by scaring advertisers away. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4247.02s)]
*  Right. And so that's exactly what they did. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4249.820000000001s)]
*  It was called the adpocalypse. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4251.34s)]
*  It happened on YouTube in 2017. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4252.740000000001s)]
*  And it's been, you know, a tough slog ever since. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4255.06s)]
*  But we still break through. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4258.18s)]
*  People still are hungry for they're just hungry for honesty. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4259.86s)]
*  Right. Even like I say, I would say half my audience doesn't share a lot of my politics, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4264.7s)]
*  but they appreciate that I'm not lying to them and that I don't call them racist or and I don't hate them. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4269.94s)]
*  I respect them and that I tell them we share we we all want the same things, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4277.179999999999s)]
*  but we just have different ways of getting there. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4281.86s)]
*  No, I well, I feel that way about you. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4283.42s)]
*  I mean, I actually do agree with a lot of what you say. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4284.98s)]
*  Not all, of course, but I think you're sincere and serious and brave. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4287.38s)]
*  And those are the three qualities that I look for in my friends and in people I trust in media. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4293.38s)]
*  Why wouldn't I? Sincere, not lying to me, maybe wrong, but not lying. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4298.900000000001s)]
*  Serious, like trying to honestly like what are the big issues, what actually matters? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4304.54s)]
*  I think that's important. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4308.5s)]
*  And brave, not going to get pushed around like, I don't know, I don't think it's that hard. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4311.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4315.78s)]
*  I mean, they've certainly tried to push me around. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4317.419999999999s)]
*  You know, they I got when I spoke at the UN Security Council, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4319.94s)]
*  I was invited to speak on the anniversary of the Nord Stream pipeline bombing. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4324.9s)]
*  And so I that's the funny. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4330.219999999999s)]
*  That's the funniest act of industrial terrorism in history because Putin did it. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4331.94s)]
*  Putin is so evil that he blew up his own pipeline. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4336.58s)]
*  He's not an evil genius. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4341.419999999999s)]
*  He's an evil moron. I guess he blew up his. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4342.5s)]
*  Number one economic stream. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4345.0199999999995s)]
*  But so when I did and I, you know, I spoke in blunt language to the Security Council about, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4346.5s)]
*  you know, if you think Russia did this, you're either a paid liar or a dupe. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4353.66s)]
*  And on my way. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4357.78s)]
*  So I did that via Zoom because I was in Europe at the time. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4360.46s)]
*  And on my way home on the plane, my computer and my iCloud account got hacked. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4363.94s)]
*  And it was from Pegasus. Right. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4371.62s)]
*  Now, Pegasus is was invented by the Mossad. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4373.5s)]
*  And it's very expensive if you want to get it cost millions of dollars. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4376.58s)]
*  And they can do anyway. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4380.22s)]
*  I remember when I got off the plane, I called my IT guy, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4381.54s)]
*  who used to be a security specialist for the military. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4383.94s)]
*  And I told him what happened. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4386.82s)]
*  And he was like, oh, my God, Jimmy, he goes, even I couldn't do that. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4388.46s)]
*  He said this wasn't a person. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4391.74s)]
*  This was a state actor. Oh, sure. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4393.06s)]
*  And I said, well, maybe I shouldn't have given that speech at the Security Council. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4395.34s)]
*  And he laughed and I go, no, I just did that. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4399.42s)]
*  He goes, oh, my God, that's what this is. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4401.3s)]
*  And so that was and then they also put my name in that list of that [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4403.860000000001s)]
*  that kill list, the Ukraine, right, has that kill list, which been there. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4407.66s)]
*  Yeah. You're on. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4411.1s)]
*  And so these are the and so now they have everything. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4411.900000000001s)]
*  So if they they want to turn it on me, they've got everything [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4415.02s)]
*  that was ever on my hard drive. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4418.46s)]
*  Everything is on my computer, my phone, on my iCloud account. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4419.9800000000005s)]
*  So they if they want to compromise me, they got a lot of stuff. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4423.38s)]
*  They've got a lot of stuff and stuff. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4427.54s)]
*  And if they're in, of course, they'll plant it on there. Right. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4428.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm if it's if it's not, you know, they'll they'll make it. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4431.98s)]
*  They'll make me look however they want to make me look. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4436.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't have a computer and I try and stay off the Internet [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4440.339999999999s)]
*  for that exact reason. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4443.9s)]
*  And I just want to say I envy you out loud many times that I [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4445.179999999999s)]
*  I think kiddie porn is wrong and I think I'm not into pornography in general. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4450.0599999999995s)]
*  And I just want to say, I mean, I you see these people [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4454.0199999999995s)]
*  without even naming names, but one of whom I know personally, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4457.82s)]
*  it's like all of a sudden, you know, you're in a kiddie porn. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4460.74s)]
*  OK. Right. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4462.82s)]
*  No, I mean, for sure. For sure. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4466.34s)]
*  I mean, I've seen it. I know [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4468.179999999999s)]
*  having been the target of that stuff and you don't want to whine about it. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4471.46s)]
*  I never want to seem like I'm whining. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4473.98s)]
*  I have a great life and I feel really privileged to have the job that I do. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4475.34s)]
*  But no, there's heavy, very heavy stuff going on. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4478.74s)]
*  There's no. I just want to want it to be a comedian. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4481.42s)]
*  I just to God, Tucker, I just wanted to be a comedian [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4483.74s)]
*  and be able to sell tickets and tour and have people like me [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4486.66s)]
*  because I was I was funny. Yeah. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4490.1s)]
*  That's all I ever wanted. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4491.820000000001s)]
*  And somehow, well, I did when I did my special in 2008, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4493.22s)]
*  it was called Citizen Jimmy on Comedy Central. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4498.14s)]
*  And that got some attention. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4500.700000000001s)]
*  And so I just got it was the Iraq War that made me get interested. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4503.46s)]
*  Like, I couldn't believe how bad the cable news was reporting this stuff. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4507.3s)]
*  So I just started talking about it in my act. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4510.58s)]
*  And and a lot of people reacted positively to it. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4512.46s)]
*  And when I started, I got offered my own public radio show [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4515.34s)]
*  in Los Angeles on KPFK, and I started just, you know, doing what would I do now? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4519.82s)]
*  Because and I realized that I could do it way better than anybody [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4525.46s)]
*  in the corporate news because I don't I don't have that mind control that they [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4531.34s)]
*  first of all, they preselect those people. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4535.42s)]
*  That's like I said, they come from Ivy League. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4537.139999999999s)]
*  You know, there's two types of people who go to journalism school, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4539.139999999999s)]
*  dupes and bad journalists. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4542.179999999999s)]
*  And couldn't agree more. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4544.219999999999s)]
*  And they all come from the same class. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4545.9s)]
*  I've never hired one. And good. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4547.82s)]
*  In 30 years of, you know, being in more than 30 years, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4549.66s)]
*  being this business, I've never hired a single journalism school. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4553.34s)]
*  It's a trade, not a profession. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4556.139999999999s)]
*  It's it's by the way, the most straightforward trade there is. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4559.139999999999s)]
*  Yes. And they want you to make you like, you know, you're not a professional. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4561.58s)]
*  I've had people say that. So you're you're not a journalist. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4565.18s)]
*  I'm like, all a journalist is is, as it was described to me, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4568.0599999999995s)]
*  is you stick your head and you look, take a look down the street [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4572.3s)]
*  and you report back what you saw. Exactly right. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4575.54s)]
*  That's all journalism is. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4577.42s)]
*  And you do it, you know, with some with a high level of honesty [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4578.66s)]
*  and a dollop of courage. And that's but it's just not hard. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4581.42s)]
*  If you're really smart, you can fix air conditioners. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4583.62s)]
*  If you're less smart, you can do journalism. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4586.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, no, that's that's real. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4588.22s)]
*  That's such a great way to put it. That's really funny. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4589.74s)]
*  Well, it's true. It's so but what? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4592.7s)]
*  OK, so I'm interested. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4594.54s)]
*  And I think you might know the answer. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4596.82s)]
*  If Trump wins in a week, a little over a week, and I think he will. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4598.26s)]
*  What? I don't see how they're going to let him win. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4603.46s)]
*  I don't if they would overthrow governments [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4606.34s)]
*  in every other part of the world and rig elections and do coups. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4609.62s)]
*  Yeah. Juan Guaido. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4614.02s)]
*  Yeah. And the whole and Zelensky and I mean, they're willing to start a nuclear war. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4615.62s)]
*  Why wouldn't they be willing to rig an election? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4620.62s)]
*  Well, I think they have and they're trying. Yeah. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4623.38s)]
*  But I think maybe, you know, there's a there's a level of popular support [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4625.860000000001s)]
*  that's just hard to hide. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4630.5s)]
*  And I think we're reaching that point. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4631.860000000001s)]
*  But OK, let's let's start at the my assumption first then. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4634.26s)]
*  And then we'll return to your. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4637.62s)]
*  So let's say Trump does win on November 5th. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4638.5s)]
*  And, you know, he wins all seven battlegrounds. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4642.26s)]
*  Maybe he gets the majority of the popular vote. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4644.7s)]
*  Maybe it's the majority of Hispanic vote. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4647.1s)]
*  I mean, markers like that that are kind of hard to lie away. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4648.62s)]
*  Right. Even if you're Joe Scarborough, like, what do you do with a number like that? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4652.42s)]
*  How does the Democratic Party respond? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4656.66s)]
*  The establishment respond? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4659.46s)]
*  I bet they just double down on everything that they really. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4661.74s)]
*  Yeah. Are you kidding? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4664.94s)]
*  Yeah. They lost him the first time. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4666.82s)]
*  And I'm like, well, this this is going to force them to change it. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4668.9s)]
*  Didn't they? They invented Russiagate. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4671.66s)]
*  They ramped up the racism. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4674.58s)]
*  They so unhealthy. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4676.139999999999s)]
*  If you fail, I've been fired a lot. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4677.54s)]
*  But a drinking problem like they have everyone. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4679.62s)]
*  But that's when you stop and you say, like, how did this happen? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4682.179999999999s)]
*  How was I part of this disaster? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4684.74s)]
*  What bad choices did I make? [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4686.98s)]
*  To what extent was it my fault? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4688.5s)]
*  You have to do that. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4690.34s)]
*  That's what it is to be an adult. Right. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4691.34s)]
*  You can't always blame other people for your problems. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4693.860000000001s)]
*  They're that it's amazing how many people aren't adults. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4696.3s)]
*  That's what that's what covid taught taught me. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4700.74s)]
*  That's what Russiagate taught me. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4702.5s)]
*  That's what every January six, Syria, Ukraine. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4703.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4707.02s)]
*  People are propagandized and they don't think they are. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4708.18s)]
*  That's the problem. They think. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4710.26s)]
*  And I had something to tell you about it, but I can't remember. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4711.9800000000005s)]
*  But when he when he won the first time in 16, I thought that was going to make them change it. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4715.26s)]
*  They just got way worse. They got in chaos. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4719.9s)]
*  And I mean, why do you think there's an open border? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4722.139999999999s)]
*  There's many reasons. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4724.42s)]
*  One is we can't meet our recruiting goals for the military. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4725.339999999999s)]
*  Exactly. And thank you for saying that. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4728.299999999999s)]
*  That's what this is. That's that's a big part of what this is. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4730.98s)]
*  And I'm not making that up. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4733.74s)]
*  Dick Durbin said it on this floor, Senate floor, into a camera [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4734.94s)]
*  that that's what this is, that we got to have these immigrants [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4739.219999999999s)]
*  so we can meet our recruiting. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4741.98s)]
*  Let's give them guns. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4743.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're not going to be a tool of of the state against the population. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4744.099999999999s)]
*  And then the Pentagon makes it legal for the military to murder American citizens. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4747.3s)]
*  Are you joking? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4752.3s)]
*  Yeah. And and another part is, of course, no one says anything about it. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4753.26s)]
*  It's as soon as unions start to get some power. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4757.02s)]
*  Right. They open the border and flood the country with with immigrants to. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4760.46s)]
*  And so now we have workers desperate, poor workers. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4767.54s)]
*  Now there are their ire is turned towards even more desperate people. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4771.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. So we put sanctions on Venezuela and to try to overthrow their government, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4776.62s)]
*  because it turns out there's more oil underneath Venezuela than there is Saudi Arabia. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4781.54s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, we got to bring their people some democracy. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4785.58s)]
*  And, you know, why don't we let Venezuela work it out? [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4789.1s)]
*  Because we don't want to let them work it out. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4792.26s)]
*  We want to install a puppet so we could get their natural resources. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4793.9400000000005s)]
*  So we put sanctions on. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4797.02s)]
*  And the whole point of sanctions is to make the people who live there miserable. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4798.74s)]
*  So they get so miserable. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4803.26s)]
*  And the idea is they'll rise up and overthrow their leader. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4804.5s)]
*  And then we can install a puppet. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4807.86s)]
*  It's never worked. Not one time. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4809.42s)]
*  Not one time has it worked. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4811.22s)]
*  They're trying to do it to Iran. Not going to work. Russia and Russia. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4812.34s)]
*  It's not working. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4815.46s)]
*  And so those people then do become miserable. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4816.34s)]
*  And then they flood our own country as immigrants and say, fly them. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4819.38s)]
*  Some of them in on jets, you know. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4823.06s)]
*  And same thing with Haiti. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4824.7s)]
*  We've been wrecking their economy. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4826.5s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, Hillary Clinton made sure they didn't get a minimum wage. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4828.38s)]
*  And it's unbelievable what we've done. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4833.179999999999s)]
*  We've stolen their natural resources. We've stolen their... [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4835.179999999999s)]
*  We've occupied their country. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4837.38s)]
*  Right now, Joe Biden is bribing the corrupt government of Kenya [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4838.7s)]
*  to send their peacekeepers over to Haiti because the war... [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4842.98s)]
*  The people are coming together in Haiti to realize that they have more in common [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4847.98s)]
*  and to oppose this puppet regime. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4852.86s)]
*  And so Joe Biden doesn't want to send the Marines. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4854.86s)]
*  He literally gave $400 million to Kenya. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4857.42s)]
*  And he's sending people to break up this uproar. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4860.14s)]
*  So what my point is, do people come to America? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4863.14s)]
*  And the mistake is to turn your eye towards the immigrant, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4866.820000000001s)]
*  which is what the establishment wants. Right. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4872.860000000001s)]
*  I would do exactly if I was in Venezuela, I'd get the hell out of there [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4875.1s)]
*  and come here and try to get a job. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4878.06s)]
*  If I was in Haiti, I'd get the hell out of there and try to come here [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4879.46s)]
*  and get a job, especially if I'm being encouraged to, which they are. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4881.9800000000005s)]
*  Paid to do it. Paid to do it. Yeah. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4885.5s)]
*  So the key is to make sure you don't lose your focus, come together [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4887.34s)]
*  and keep your eye on the establishment that's creating those desperate people [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4892.74s)]
*  and opening the border and creating chaos. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4896.42s)]
*  And let's remember, chaos always favors the establishment. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4899.1s)]
*  And so it makes you... This isn't different. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4902.54s)]
*  You know, Mao did a very similar thing [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4906.18s)]
*  that he split, he did divide and conquer. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4909.860000000001s)]
*  Can I just ask you a question? Chaos always favors the establishment. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4913.46s)]
*  Yes. Chaos always favors the establishment. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4916.86s)]
*  And if you feel like you're living in a chaotic country, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4918.46s)]
*  it's because it's intentional. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4921.179999999999s)]
*  It's so true. You know... [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4923.299999999999s)]
*  Sorry, I interrupt you, but I just want [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4924.54s)]
*  I just want that to hang in the air for a second, because I think that's really wise [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4926.46s)]
*  and it's worth remembering, you know, ten days out from a presidential election. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4929.339999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4932.78s)]
*  We did a live tour last month, one of the funnest things we've ever done. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4933.7s)]
*  Coast to coast, 16 different cities speaking. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4937.339999999999s)]
*  Well, next week, our grand finale. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4940.78s)]
*  Halloween, October 31st, 2024 in Glendale, Arizona, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4943.22s)]
*  our special guest that night, days before the presidential election, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4947.46s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4951.26s)]
*  All proceeds donated to Hurricane Relief. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4952.7s)]
*  We're proud to do it. Hope to see you there. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4955.780000000001s)]
*  So what... I'm sorry, I interrupt. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4965.780000000001s)]
*  Tell me what Mao did. How did he use chaos? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4967.62s)]
*  Well, he he split the people up into the the good people and the bad people. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4969.38s)]
*  And the good people were the people who did what they're supposed to. Right. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4973.9800000000005s)]
*  And if everybody just did what they were supposed to, we'd have this utopia. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4977.34s)]
*  And but we can't have it because the bad people won't do it. Right. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4980.860000000001s)]
*  Well, just like with Covid, right. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4984.9800000000005s)]
*  Now, Rob Schneider makes this point, right, in his book, which is fantastic, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4987.18s)]
*  that like during Covid, it was like we could get out of this pandemic [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4991.3s)]
*  if those bad people would just take a vaccine, which was always a lie. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4995.58s)]
*  You could never vaccinate your way out of this pandemic. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=4999.7s)]
*  You could never get rid of the coronavirus. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5002.42s)]
*  And they couldn't. But that was a lie. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5004.5s)]
*  But that kept them. And then so that's how they kept people divided and conquer. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5006.26s)]
*  And that's what it so that's what's going on. Right. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5011.86s)]
*  The it's why can Gavin Newsom all of a sudden clean up homelessness in San [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5014.34s)]
*  Francisco when he's having the president of China visit? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5019.62s)]
*  But he can't do it before and he really can't do it after. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5024.54s)]
*  What? That's all. I mean, of course. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5027.5s)]
*  So chaos favors the estate. They want it that way. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5029.18s)]

*  They're quislings, they're collaborators with the totalitarian regime. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5406.219999999999s)]
*  And they they should be panicked. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5409.62s)]
*  100 percent. Right. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5410.9s)]
*  And you see the things they want to focus on instead of what they [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5412.3s)]
*  what people want them to focus on. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5415.5s)]
*  You see when MSNBC will go and do [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5417.219999999999s)]
*  they'll interview some regular voters in like Wisconsin or Michigan. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5420.38s)]
*  And they keep bringing up they'll bring up January six. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5423.7s)]
*  And people are like, what? What are you talking about? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5426.02s)]
*  Like that doesn't affect my life. Who cares? Who cares about that? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5427.9400000000005s)]
*  Do you know who does care about that? You, the liberals, the media. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5430.58s)]
*  And then the people who watch that media are taught that they're supposed to care [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5434.26s)]
*  because we almost lost our democracy, which, again, I already pointed out, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5437.86s)]
*  you know, live in a democracy. You're a chump. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5440.54s)]
*  It was unarmed. You can't have an unarmed insurrection. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5442.42s)]
*  These were old ladies deep in debt with diabetes who believed in the Constitution. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5445.58s)]
*  You could say they were wrong to think the election was stolen. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5450.58s)]
*  OK, that's a real debate. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5454.58s)]
*  Happy to have that debate. But they believe that they were not sinister. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5455.62s)]
*  It was an FBI. Yes, that was just a regular riot [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5458.54s)]
*  that was allowed to happen and encouraged to happen by the FBI plants in the crowd. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5461.26s)]
*  And how do I know that? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5466.06s)]
*  Well, because Christopher Wray, the head of the FBI, was under congressional testimony. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5467.14s)]
*  And he was asked, did you have FBI assets dressed up as MAGA [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5471.06s)]
*  supporters inside the Capitol before the riot started? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5475.18s)]
*  And he said, I can't answer that question, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5478.18s)]
*  which means yes. Yes. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5479.74s)]
*  The answer should be no, which is what the congressman said. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5481.179999999999s)]
*  The answer should be no. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5483.78s)]
*  Well, the answer should be we're not going to continue to fund your agency [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5485.5s)]
*  if you don't answer the question. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5489.62s)]
*  And we're sure not going to build you a brand new building, which they did. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5491.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson signed off on to his eternal shame. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5493.9s)]
*  One of the many things for which he should be ashamed. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5498.5s)]
*  Anyway, but yeah, no, it's but again, we're kind of proving the point [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5501.139999999999s)]
*  that underlies my question, which is everybody kind of knows what's up now. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5506.7s)]
*  So how can you continue? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5512.139999999999s)]
*  I hope so. I just hope so, because we travel in different circles. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5513.86s)]
*  Right. And, you know, I'm in liberal Hollywood and you're other places. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5518.139999999999s)]
*  I really see when people are still there, they're hypnotized. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5522.78s)]
*  They're in a trance. Even now. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5528.34s)]
*  Yeah. Look at the media. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5529.98s)]
*  I mean, they think the media is real. They think it's the news. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5531.139999999999s)]
*  Yes. In Hollywood. Yes. Yes. In Los Angeles. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5534.46s)]
*  What happens when you're at a dinner party and you start dropping stuff like this? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5537.900000000001s)]
*  It's a dinner party. Oh, is that true? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5542.14s)]
*  Yeah. You're eating sushi alone in Ventura Boulevard. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5543.9800000000005s)]
*  Correct. That's correct. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5546.42s)]
*  Yes. You know, I mean, I hang out with other heretics, you know. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5550.58s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5555.660000000001s)]
*  You do like how could you still be hypnotized after all of like I get. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5557.820000000001s)]
*  OK, this virus shows up from China. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5561.7s)]
*  You think it's got a 50 percent death rate or whatever. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5564.139999999999s)]
*  People are afraid. I understand. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5567.3s)]
*  But, you know, four years later, really, you still think that's real? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5569.54s)]
*  You know what the real death rate was? [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5573.82s)]
*  0.27 percent. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5575.78s)]
*  It was like less than half a percent. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5577.82s)]
*  And, you know, that's the thing about Bill Gates, right? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5580.0199999999995s)]
*  He wants to make it, by the way, illegal to misinform. Right. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5583.78s)]
*  He's like, well, we always had we've always had restrictions on free [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5588.7s)]
*  and he talks with his hands, which is first sign of a liar. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5592.099999999999s)]
*  And he's saying he's talking like this. That's true. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5595.38s)]
*  I don't know. I'm making it up. But [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5597.5s)]
*  he does have like grandiose hand gestures, which is it. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5600.78s)]
*  That's that. Yeah, it is a bad sign. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5604.0599999999995s)]
*  He and he says he said we've always had restrictions on speech. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5607.86s)]
*  You know, you can't threaten someone's life and, you know, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5611.66s)]
*  you shouldn't be allowed to misinform someone on vaccines to make them hesitant. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5615.5s)]
*  What did you just conflate? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5620.22s)]
*  You just conflated death threats against someone and talking about the vaccine. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5622.18s)]
*  You see that? And he's a number one investor. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5626.46s)]
*  And so people don't know this. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5628.58s)]
*  But as soon as Bill Gates, he invested 50 million dollars in Pfizer. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5630.42s)]
*  And then it went up during Covid. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5634.34s)]
*  And he cashed out at five hundred and fifty million dollars. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5636.18s)]
*  And as soon as he cashed out, he started shitting on the vaccine. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5639.46s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the video, but he was. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5642.14s)]
*  I play this on my show all the time. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5644.18s)]
*  He said, well, we didn't know at the beginning that it had a low fatality rate [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5646.14s)]
*  and that it affected mostly just the elderly, kind of like the flu, but a bit different. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5651.38s)]
*  Now, they don't play that on MSNBC, CNN. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5656.02s)]
*  They don't play that anywhere. Right. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5658.900000000001s)]
*  I played on my show, right, which is why I'm borderline content. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5660.1s)]
*  And but there it is. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5663.62s)]
*  And I'm like, well, why would any like, yeah, there was a lot of problems [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5664.820000000001s)]
*  with the vaccine. They weren't infection blocking. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5667.780000000001s)]
*  They didn't have long term data. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5670.22s)]
*  And I'm like, whoa, whoa. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5672.0199999999995s)]
*  All he had to do was cash in his stock and immediately starts telling the truth. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5673.379999999999s)]
*  But I'm like, I bet there's something else up. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5676.419999999999s)]
*  And soon enough or immediately after that, he started selling this new vaccine [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5679.099999999999s)]
*  that you inhaled through your nose. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5684.219999999999s)]
*  And he said, these are better. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5686.459999999999s)]
*  These are infection blocking and these are long lasting. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5687.94s)]
*  And I'm like, and I'm like, well, let's see. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5690.58s)]
*  He's invested in the company that's making that out of India. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5692.82s)]
*  But why? I mean, this is the point where I get. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5696.0199999999995s)]
*  Religious, because I don't understand why someone like Bill Gates or Larry [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5700.1s)]
*  Fink or really any of these people who have multiple billion dollars [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5704.620000000001s)]
*  would care about making more money. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5709.46s)]
*  I think that's it's a really diseased like that is money worship. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5712.1s)]
*  But I'm not against being rich. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5715.06s)]
*  I like making money, I guess, but not that much. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5717.18s)]
*  But some I like not being in debt. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5720.54s)]
*  OK, I get that. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5723.02s)]
*  You know, I want people to have more money. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5724.26s)]
*  But if you've got billions of dollars, like, why would you spend any time [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5726.0199999999995s)]
*  making more? I think that's really sick. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5729.9s)]
*  Well, that I think that, you know, it it becomes a it's a game to these. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5732.139999999999s)]

*  Well, there's there. They don't have any other meaning. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5738.82s)]
*  Right. I mean, except for, you know, covering up his trips to Jeffrey Epstein's Island. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5741.259999999999s)]

*  they think he's a nerd and he's a good person. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5755.66s)]
*  You know, just like a girl, just like Rachel Maddow wouldn't lie to you. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5757.82s)]
*  She's she's gay. Gay people don't lie. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5761.66s)]

*  you wouldn't think they would lie to you. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5774.34s)]
*  And that's why they hired them. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5775.58s)]
*  And then they go along. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5777.3s)]
*  So same thing with which Bill Gates. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5779.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, he is never he wasn't inventory. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5782.22s)]
*  But he was a he was a good monopolist and he knew how to crush other businesses. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5786.14s)]
*  He didn't write the code. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5790.54s)]
*  He bought the code and and he knew how to become monopolist. Right. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5791.900000000001s)]
*  There were times when people were throwing pies in his face. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5796.58s)]
*  Do you remember that? Very well. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5799.06s)]
*  And the media had turned against him. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5800.3s)]
*  And so he had like, well, I can't let this happen. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5802.02s)]
*  So then he started by the hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5804.58s)]
*  He started buying off media companies and he started starting [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5808.02s)]
*  journalism schools and people. Yeah, stuff like that. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5811.26s)]
*  So like, for instance, PBS NewsHour didn't have like a science segment. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5814.62s)]
*  He funded it. Right. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5820.54s)]
*  And so then then they he would. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5822.46s)]
*  Bill Gates funded PBS science coverage. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5824.98s)]
*  Yeah. So the so he's there funding [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5827.86s)]
*  the creation of the research for a vaccine. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5831.74s)]
*  He then funds the coverage of that. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5836.14s)]
*  And then he funds the NGO that's going to distribute the vaccine. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5838.5s)]
*  I mean, he's got it coming and going. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5842.06s)]
*  You know that he's co-opted the media. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5843.98s)]
*  That's why he's seen as a media darling. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5847.379999999999s)]
*  Now, people think he's a great guy. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5849.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, I've had again, people said, Jimmy, he's just trying to [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5850.66s)]
*  end malaria in Africa. He's trying to. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5854.0199999999995s)]
*  He's like, well, if you listen to exactly what has happened [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5857.099999999999s)]
*  and why there's certain countries, countries that don't want to do business. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5860.94s)]
*  In fact, I think there's lawsuits against him in other countries. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5863.9s)]
*  And if what he actually did and what he actually did in Africa, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5867.58s)]
*  listen to Bobby Kennedy, he'll tell you what. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5871.419999999999s)]
*  I'm not an expert on it, but I've listened to Bobby Kennedy talking. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5873.1s)]
*  It's nefarious. It's gross. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5876.3s)]
*  And it's egregious. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5878.9400000000005s)]
*  So I think he's just a megalomaniac. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5880.9400000000005s)]
*  And yeah, I think that that doesn't go away. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5883.620000000001s)]
*  Right. That that that's that's where he gets his life meaning from. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5887.740000000001s)]
*  But these I guess what I'm saying is, what about Jeff Bezos? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5891.9800000000005s)]
*  He hasn't made enough money. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5894.34s)]
*  He's not stopping Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5895.900000000001s)]
*  Come on. What do you make of speaking of Bezos [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5898.620000000001s)]
*  and all these guys who care about global warming? [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5902.14s)]
*  Like Jeff Zuckerberg or Mark Zuckerberg, you see his new yacht? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5904.34s)]
*  It's because he cares about global warming, because he cares about [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5909.94s)]
*  it's got four diesel engines on it, but I bet I bet he's got an electric stove on it. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5911.9s)]
*  I mean, well, I mean, I think the purpose of those yachts is, well, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5918.02s)]
*  to go to the south of France in the summertime, which is fun. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5921.38s)]
*  But also it's to escape the mess that they're making now. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5924.34s)]
*  Yeah, obviously. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5928.14s)]
*  But Zuckerberg's is five feet shorter than Bezos, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5929.34s)]
*  because, you know, he's a man of the people. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5931.9800000000005s)]
*  So what do you make? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5934.42s)]
*  So Bezos's paper, The Washington Post, which is the official organ [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5935.62s)]
*  of the intelligence season, has been for many, many decades, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5939.26s)]
*  refused to endorse Kamal Harris. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5943.42s)]
*  And Bezos has taken, you know, Bob Kagan, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5946.900000000001s)]
*  one of the dumbest people in Washington, Tori Nuland's husband, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5950.26s)]
*  former co-worker of mine, truly a mouth breather, like an idiot. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5953.9800000000005s)]
*  But he resigns in protest because democracy is dying in darkness [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5958.38s)]
*  because they didn't endorse Carmela Harris or something. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5961.74s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5965.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, it's funny to watch the liberal class wake up to the fact that, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5966.9s)]
*  hey, maybe it's not a good idea to have a handful of billionaires on our media. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5971.22s)]
*  Is like, oh, what? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5974.46s)]
*  You mean he's doing this for business interests? Yes. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5975.86s)]
*  That's why he's doing this, because he wants to have to continue [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5978.5s)]
*  his billions and billions of dollars of contracts with the CIA and the government. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5983.1s)]
*  And he's afraid that Trump will step in the way of that. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5987.18s)]
*  Plus, he's got he's now wanted to do the space. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5989.46s)]
*  That's why Elon Musk is a threat to him, right? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5992.860000000001s)]
*  And doing contracts with the government for space exploration and that kind of stuff. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5995.02s)]
*  That's what this is about. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=5999.58s)]
*  That's exactly what this is about. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6000.860000000001s)]
*  And so the same thing happened with the L.A. Times, you know, like, oh, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6002.5s)]
*  there's another billionaire that maybe we shouldn't have billionaires. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6005.780000000001s)]
*  And so they were OK with it as long as he was going along. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6009.3s)]
*  Do you think Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6012.62s)]
*  because he's committed to the truth? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6015.26s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6017.46s)]
*  He's got there because he needs to manufacture consent. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6018.820000000001s)]
*  He's got that because he wants to control the narrative. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6021.860000000001s)]
*  That's what that's about. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6024.26s)]
*  And as long as it went along with their hate, they were OK with it. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6025.34s)]
*  Right. And how does this coalition, the Democratic coalition, hold together? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6029.66s)]
*  It's got a bunch of different component parts, rich white ladies, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6034.9400000000005s)]
*  obviously being the pivotal component, but lots of others. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6037.7s)]
*  Poor black people, immigrants, gays. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6041.34s)]
*  But it is falling apart. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6045.139999999999s)]
*  Well, those here's just my meta view of it as a complete outsider. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6046.86s)]
*  These groups don't have common interests. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6051.459999999999s)]
*  So I'm not really sure than like hating straight white men, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6053.98s)]
*  which is not really a reason to have a party over time. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6056.5s)]
*  It's not that interesting or meaningful, really. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6059.299999999999s)]
*  What like how could you hold that coalition together? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6062.0199999999995s)]
*  They're they're just doing it with propaganda and hatred and the fear. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6066.459999999999s)]
*  Right. Fear works. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6069.86s)]
*  And but is it falling apart? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6071.419999999999s)]
*  Well, I I'm pretty sure I saw a headline the other day [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6074.42s)]
*  that said that Trump is winning the Hispanic vote. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6078.26s)]
*  That's like I mean, yeah, that's incredible. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6080.620000000001s)]
*  I just he's he's not making the most gains. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6083.46s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it corrects fact check me on that. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6085.42s)]
*  But, you know, more black people are voting for him [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6087.860000000001s)]
*  than any other Republican. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6092.46s)]
*  And it's it's hopefully people are waking up that the [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6094.18s)]
*  Democratic rule isn't materially improving their lives. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6099.54s)]
*  And I think a lot of people, I think Hispanics, I mean, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6103.259999999999s)]
*  are against illegal immigration. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6107.419999999999s)]
*  Oh, big time. Oh, big time. They are. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6110.98s)]
*  That's that's for real. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6113.339999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. For lots of different reasons, moral and practical. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6116.179999999999s)]
*  They're against it. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6120.299999999999s)]
*  And how patronizing to assume that you'd be for crime [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6120.98s)]
*  just because you share the same sounding last name as the people committing. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6124.9s)]
*  And it's like insane. That's so talk about racist. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6128.66s)]
*  Well, what is the whole thing of that, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6131.94s)]
*  which I'm surprised Trump doesn't make a bigger deal out of, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6134.9s)]
*  is that Trump did the Step Back, which released a lot of nonviolent [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6137.82s)]
*  black people from prison, which is the opposite of what Joe Biden [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6142.099999999999s)]
*  and Kamala Harris did. Joe Biden wrote the crime bill. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6145.42s)]
*  He still brags about it. Won't apologize for it, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6147.54s)]
*  which is why black and brown people are locked up at way higher rates [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6149.62s)]
*  than their population. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6152.42s)]
*  And Kamala Harris kept black and brown people in prison [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6153.7s)]
*  after a federal judge ordered her to release them in California three times. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6158.38s)]
*  And her office argued in court that we have to keep them in prison [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6163.82s)]
*  because it would upset the prison labor force. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6167.54s)]
*  So what she's literally doing is I need to keep them as slaves. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6169.78s)]
*  I mean, that's what she did. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6173.58s)]
*  She kept black and brown people in prison for slavery, because that's what it is. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6175.3s)]
*  And Trump never brings that up. It's weird. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6180.1s)]
*  I don't know, maybe because he feels like it will make her seem more, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6182.42s)]
*  you know, a fighter of crime. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6185.9s)]
*  But she's actually I mean, she targeted black single mothers [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6187.0599999999995s)]
*  when she was going to pump. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6190.46s)]
*  She went after and prosecuted the parents of truants. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6192.26s)]
*  And who did she target? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6196.3s)]
*  She targeted black single parents. And I've covered it on my show. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6197.5s)]
*  She did that. And then she called out the press to go and cover it [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6201.0599999999995s)]
*  when they were being perp walked. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6204.78s)]
*  Single mothers, black mothers. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6206.62s)]
*  And the one woman who I covered, her daughter had sickle cell anemia. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6208.5s)]
*  She was in hospital. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6212.46s)]
*  And everybody knew this. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6214.34s)]
*  Kamala Harris didn't care. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6215.74s)]
*  She sent the the cops to go arrest her and she lost her house. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6217.26s)]
*  She lost her job. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6221.34s)]
*  Her kid had a stroke. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6222.860000000001s)]
*  That that's who Kamala Harris is, right? [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6225.9400000000005s)]
*  That's who she always has been. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6228.18s)]
*  And that's who Joe Biden is. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6229.900000000001s)]
*  And it's funny that how they can flip that script on Trump. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6231.74s)]
*  I tried to remind people that, hey, you know, the reason why black [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6235.5s)]
*  and brown people are locked up isn't because of Donald Trump. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6239.46s)]
*  It's because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6241.74s)]
*  And they didn't say they just can't compute. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6244.58s)]
*  It just goes against, you know, whenever I've had, [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6246.54s)]
*  I'll have a conversation with someone from my old life [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6249.42s)]
*  and I'll I'll do an information dump like this on them. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6252.9s)]
*  And I'll never forget. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6257.219999999999s)]
*  I just had a conversation with a comedian friend of mine. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6258.26s)]
*  And there was just like a long silent pause. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6260.9s)]
*  And he goes, that's a lot to it's a lot to think about. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6262.86s)]
*  That's what is that? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6266.86s)]
*  That's a lot to think about. Like, it means I'm not going to think about it. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6268.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And it means I'm not going to think about it. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6271.34s)]
*  It's too much. And there's no way you could be telling me the truth. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6273.22s)]
*  And but I'm not going to look into it because that would be doing my own research, Tucker. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6276.54s)]
*  And you're not supposed to do your own research. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6280.62s)]
*  No, we've got mom to do that for us. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6282.46s)]
*  Can I get let me insert another I'm trying to to break the the the wall of of pessimism here. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6285.62s)]
*  So Bobby Kennedy, if you had checked in with any American [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6292.78s)]
*  who Bobby Kennedy was for the last 20 years and says, who's Bobby Kennedy? [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6295.82s)]
*  He's the guy who falsely connects vaccines with autism. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6298.7s)]
*  And that's why he was not allowed in The New York Times. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6303.34s)]
*  That's why he was called a Nazi. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6305.5s)]
*  It's kind of speaking of drummed out of polite society. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6306.7s)]
*  He was after that Rolling Stone piece about 20 years ago, [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6309.18s)]
*  connecting autism with vaccines, even the even the autism organizations denounced him. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6313.46s)]
*  So in the tank they are. But [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6319.3s)]
*  you never hear anybody criticize him for that anymore. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6321.98s)]
*  It does feel like there has been a change, even in the media, on that question. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6326.42s)]
*  There has been. I saw a guy in CNBC the other day, like some head of some CEO [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6331.86s)]
*  talk about 72 shots. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6336.66s)]
*  He's like, exactly. See that? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6338.3s)]
*  No, I didn't. But I see people who. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6340.219999999999s)]
*  Well, even I was never against vaccine. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6343.78s)]
*  I mean, I've never spent four minutes thinking about vaccine either. Right. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6345.42s)]
*  So but I see. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6348.3s)]
*  But because of my job, I had to. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6350.139999999999s)]
*  But I see people who is very normal people. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6351.7s)]
*  Who don't think it's outrageous to ask, is there a connection between the vaccine [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6356.099999999999s)]
*  schedule and the rise in autism? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6361.259999999999s)]
*  That wall seems to have been breached. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6364.139999999999s)]
*  People's minds seem more open. Am I imagining this? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6367.219999999999s)]
*  Well, it used to be people like Jim Carrey. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6369.66s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6372.34s)]
*  It used to be people like Robert De Niro. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6373.62s)]
*  Really? Oh, Robert De Niro. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6376.58s)]
*  I have a clip of him on the Today Show. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6377.9s)]
*  There was that movie. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6379.58s)]
*  I think it was the first unvaxed or something like that [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6380.46s)]
*  that was supposed to play at his Soho Film Festival. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6383.259999999999s)]
*  And there was a big they didn't want it to air. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6386.98s)]
*  They don't want him to show it. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6390.0599999999995s)]
*  And he was on the Today Show. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6391.339999999999s)]
*  And he's like, there's something there. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6392.9s)]
*  You have to look at it. There's something there. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6394.78s)]
*  This is a direct quote. No way. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6396.82s)]
*  Yeah. If that video is out there, I've showed it on my show. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6398.98s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he got the phone call. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6401.82s)]
*  And that was that he never talked about it again. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6404.94s)]
*  And that film didn't get in fact, I had the guy who did the film on my show. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6408.379999999999s)]
*  That film didn't air. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6412.22s)]
*  And that was that. Yeah. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6413.62s)]
*  So it used to be people like that. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6415.58s)]
*  And yeah, there were like and I remember [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6417.62s)]
*  just in the interest of full disclosure and honesty and repentance. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6421.58s)]
*  I remember making fun of them. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6424.46s)]
*  Me, too. So that's that's where I was at the time, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6426.7s)]
*  which was unthinking and stupid and reactionary. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6429.820000000001s)]
*  And I apologize for that. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6433.02s)]
*  But but I just again, I feel like there's been a massive change [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6434.46s)]
*  just on the ground, as we say, with normal people. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6438.26s)]
*  And their willingness to entertain new ideas. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6441.9s)]
*  Well, when, you know, autism goes from one in ten thousand to now, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6444.379999999999s)]
*  the last I saw was in California. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6449.82s)]
*  It's like one in twenty two. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6452.219999999999s)]
*  Some crazy low number like that. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6454.58s)]
*  I think enough people have been affected and touched by it [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6457.179999999999s)]
*  that they are questioning. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6459.62s)]
*  And so, you know, I used to always say, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6460.74s)]
*  you know, conservatives can't understand a problem until it affects them. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6463.98s)]
*  Directly. But it turns out it's everybody. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6467.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. It turns out that's everybody. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6469.86s)]
*  So when it affects you, you're having to me, you know, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6471.58s)]
*  I didn't look into covid policy until I got vaccine injured. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6474.26s)]
*  And then as soon as I got vaccine injured, I was like [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6479.1s)]
*  I was put into a study and some of the drug, one of the drugs was [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6482.18s)]
*  Ivermectin that they were giving me. And I was like, hey. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6485.98s)]
*  And then they explained to me, Jimmy, this is on the WHO [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6488.38s)]
*  list of essential medicines. I won the Nobel Prize. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6491.0199999999995s)]
*  It's been prescribed billions of times. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6494.1s)]
*  That's not what they told me at MSNBC. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6495.86s)]
*  And before covid, it was looked at as a miracle drug. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6497.74s)]
*  They were saying it could cure cancer. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6500.82s)]
*  And I looked at the doctor and I said, well, why would they be saying this? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6502.78s)]
*  And he explained because they can't get their emergency use authorization [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6505.46s)]
*  if this actually treats it, even though in their own literature, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6509.06s)]
*  it says it does treat coronavirus. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6511.98s)]
*  And and I was like, well, what else are they lying about? [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6514.02s)]
*  And it turned out, Tucker, there wasn't a thing they weren't lying about. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6517.54s)]
*  They were lying about the origin of the virus. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6520.34s)]
*  We all know they were lying about funding it. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6522.22s)]
*  They were lying about herd immunity. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6524.66s)]
*  They were lying about natural immunity. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6526.42s)]
*  They were lying about transmission. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6527.86s)]
*  They were lying about contraction. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6529.58s)]
*  They were lying about mass. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6531.38s)]
*  They were lying about lockdowns. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6532.66s)]
*  There wasn't anything that they would lie about. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6534.38s)]
*  They were lying about the danger of the vaccine. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6536.74s)]
*  That's what I mean. The side effect. Yeah. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6539.22s)]
*  And you unfortunately lived that. Yeah, I still do. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6540.98s)]
*  Yeah. So I had nerve damage from it. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6544.54s)]
*  I had a simple neuralgia, among other things. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6546.7s)]
*  My blood pressure went through the right. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6549.38s)]
*  I had my blood pressure was 180 over 140. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6551.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I was in bad shape. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6553.7s)]
*  And it's like stroke level. Yeah. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6555.3s)]
*  I could add a stroke gap. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6557.34s)]
*  And I mean, who knows? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6559.18s)]
*  I might have had many strokes. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6561.06s)]
*  But anyway. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6562.9800000000005s)]
*  So I don't know what the question was, but the covid thing is why. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6565.34s)]
*  Yeah, I just the people's minds are up. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6569.700000000001s)]
*  It's like four years ago, if we'd had this conversation, [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6571.06s)]
*  even just exactly what you said over the past two minutes, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6574.02s)]
*  that would have been considered like, whoa. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6576.900000000001s)]
*  First of all, don't talk about your vaccine injury. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6579.26s)]
*  Well, selfish prick. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6581.22s)]
*  Like, how dare you? [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6583.54s)]
*  I had people come at me. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6585.46s)]
*  You know, again, people I know. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6587.18s)]
*  Why are you talking about it? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6588.7s)]
*  Don't you're going to make people vaccine hesitant? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6590.34s)]
*  And I was like, well, I said that to your face. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6593.0599999999995s)]
*  They said it to me online. Right. Wow. Yeah. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6594.66s)]
*  This is I don't go on Facebook. Facebook is miserable. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6598.42s)]
*  I go on Twitter, right, because you can actually get news and stuff from there. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6602.0199999999995s)]
*  And people would come at me and attack me on Twitter like that. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6605.34s)]
*  I'm just like, you don't you don't know. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6608.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, I get that you don't know anything about covid. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6610.0199999999995s)]
*  But why are you so loud about it? Right. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6612.5s)]
*  No, that's boy. Isn't that the truth? Yeah. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6615.9s)]
*  And none of that. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6618.74s)]
*  I mean, some of my favorite comedians. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6619.54s)]
*  And I've talked about this in my special. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6621.58s)]
*  I talk about it on stage and talk about it on my show. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6623.139999999999s)]
*  But my some of my favorite comedians that I looked up to in their special, [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6625.98s)]
*  they would shame people for trying to get informed about covid [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6629.54s)]
*  and experimental medical treatment. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6632.82s)]
*  They would shame them. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6634.54s)]
*  And I'm like, if you're you're shaming people, [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6635.82s)]
*  you know, you're not supposed to shame people for questioning authority. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6638.5s)]
*  You're supposed to shame people for following rules without questioning authority. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6641.3s)]
*  And if you're shaming people for questioning authority, you're not doing comedy. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6644.94s)]
*  You're selling cars. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6647.94s)]
*  I don't know what the hell you're doing. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6649.0199999999995s)]
*  But it broke my heart. Did that. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6650.78s)]
*  I don't want to name names, but there are. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6652.58s)]
*  But like legit comedians, legit the top, the top comics. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6655.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, I know the late night guys did all of them. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6658.94s)]
*  All of that was shameful, shameful, disgusting. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6661.7s)]
*  Is and they'll never apologize till never the thing. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6665.7s)]
*  They'll also never recover. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6668.74s)]
*  They will never recover from that. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6669.94s)]
*  Well, it's funny that Greg Goldfeld now creams them all in the ratings. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6671.66s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. Case in point. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6675.86s)]
*  Who watches that shit anyway? [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6677.74s)]
*  It's it's hey, you want to have some superficial com. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6679.46s)]
*  It's all like they're all sitting there. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6683.38s)]
*  You say the talking point from the from the studio. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6684.7s)]
*  I'll say the talking point from the studio. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6687.82s)]
*  We'll pretend we're having a real conversation. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6689.58s)]
*  Late night talk shows are the most boring, stupid, vapid. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6691.26s)]
*  They're just unbelievably stupid. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6695.3s)]
*  I know. I can't believe who watches. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6697.099999999999s)]
*  Is there anybody over 16 years old that watches that stuff? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6699.179999999999s)]
*  No, I can't imagine. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6702.7s)]
*  What can you imagine? [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6704.38s)]
*  How your brain must be mushed to be able to there's actual shows out there now. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6705.38s)]
*  There's shows like this. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6709.9800000000005s)]
*  There's shows like Joe Roe. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6711.14s)]
*  There's shows where people have real conversations about really interesting things [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6712.46s)]
*  and they're not trying to sell you anything. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6717.14s)]
*  I don't get how those shows are again, but there must be important for the propaganda. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6719.58s)]
*  They that's why that, you know, that's what keeps them going. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6724.14s)]
*  I guess they must make money somehow. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6727.42s)]
*  I just think there were at a point where the people in charge have [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6729.58s)]
*  really only two options. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6733.38s)]
*  One is the one that I hope they'll choose, which is to look inside and ask, as every adult should, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6735.219999999999s)]
*  how did I play a role in what went wrong? [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6742.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, what did I? [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6744.74s)]
*  You know, seriously, like, just take a look inside. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6745.7s)]
*  I mean, that's the basis of AA. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6747.74s)]
*  It's why it's the basis of joy, actually. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6749.0199999999995s)]
*  So they do that. Or they have to use real force to get people to comply. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6752.5s)]
*  They can no longer do it through propaganda exclusively [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6756.7s)]
*  or through any kind of consent manufacturer or real. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6760.38s)]
*  They have to just go right to force because people just don't believe it anymore. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6764.099999999999s)]
*  They have no authority. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6767.74s)]
*  They did force during Covid. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6769.54s)]
*  They forced you. You couldn't travel. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6770.58s)]
*  You couldn't go to work. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6772.38s)]
*  They fired people, like I said, you know, 70,000 health care workers. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6773.78s)]
*  Yes, they used force, but they had the capos like in the population enforcing [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6776.98s)]
*  the PMCs a hundred percent. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6782.62s)]
*  And I just feel like that, you know, some of whom, all of whom, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6786.099999999999s)]
*  have my contempt, I will say, and all of whom should apologize. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6789.94s)]
*  But many of whom are totally sincere in believing that the lady [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6793.26s)]
*  at the grocery store without the mask was a threat to everyone's life. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6796.18s)]
*  Like, they really believe that. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6798.62s)]
*  I believed it. I wanted to fight with my brother over it [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6799.86s)]
*  because I thought he was being reckless and selfish, right? [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6805.38s)]
*  Selfish. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6808.62s)]
*  And being dumb and I was, oh, I was so I was that person. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6809.86s)]
*  So I I have compassion for those people who are propaganda. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6813.74s)]
*  Yes, yes, I do, too, because I was one of them. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6817.86s)]
*  But I just think that that population is really small now. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6821.5s)]
*  So if you want to continue with your fake democracy, [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6824.78s)]
*  if you want to continue looting the country, you just kind of have to [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6829.219999999999s)]
*  pull out the gun and say obey at this point. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6831.98s)]
*  They really have to go to force. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6834.139999999999s)]
*  And I think that's why they've now allowed the Pentagon to murder [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6835.94s)]
*  American citizens who won't comply. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6839.98s)]
*  I mean, I don't what's the other explanation? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6841.86s)]
*  Yeah, that that it almost seems too crazy to believe, right? [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6844.14s)]
*  Well, I saw it. I mean, that just happened. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6848.3s)]
*  That's all. Yeah, I saw it. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6849.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, boy, if I didn't, that's they're not not doing it for a reason. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6851.54s)]
*  I mean, they're doing it for a reason. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6855.06s)]
*  That's how you think. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6856.38s)]
*  And like, oh, boy, they're getting ready, right? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6857.620000000001s)]
*  They're getting ready to do. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6859.620000000001s)]
*  So I thought my first thought was they're getting ready to throw the election. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6860.780000000001s)]
*  And then when people protest, they're going to go in and squelch it and say, [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6864.46s)]
*  look, these people are just like we said, they're always violent. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6867.1s)]
*  They're doing January 6, but they're doing on a grander scale. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6869.660000000001s)]
*  They're doing that's what that's what I think. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6872.34s)]
*  That's what that that was. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6873.780000000001s)]
*  I could be wrong. That's just a guess. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6874.900000000001s)]
*  But they're doing it not for a good reason. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6876.780000000001s)]
*  Not for a good. Well, I just don't think they're sort of out of options. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6879.3s)]
*  And we may look back wistfully at a time when they can control the population [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6882.38s)]
*  with CNN, you know, when Wolf Blitzer was enough to get people to obey. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6887.58s)]
*  And and now that, you know, it's a joke, they're all a joke. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6892.860000000001s)]
*  And then we but we know they're a joke. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6896.34s)]
*  The kidnapper has taken off his mask like he doesn't have any choice. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6897.860000000001s)]
*  He has to kill us. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6900.740000000001s)]
*  Well, that's why they're the digital currency is such a big deal, I think, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6901.58s)]
*  because they can control you through digital currency. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6904.94s)]
*  And I mean, look what they did to the truckers in Canada. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6907.3s)]
*  They cut off their funds and now you can't do anything. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6910.3s)]
*  You can't go anywhere. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6912.74s)]
*  And even even people who donated to them got in trouble and got their funds frozen. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6913.58s)]
*  So if they can, including their Bitcoin, [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6917.98s)]
*  and they froze people's Bitcoin, how did they do that? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6920.98s)]
*  Through the exchanges. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6924.58s)]
*  Oh, I thought that was the whole beauty of Bitcoin. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6926.1s)]
*  That's what I thought, too. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6928.94s)]
*  That's what I thought, too. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6929.94s)]
*  And I think it could be the beauty of it. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6930.98s)]
*  I'm not attacking Bitcoin, just to be clear. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6932.94s)]
*  But a lot of the crypto people, if you ask them directly, [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6935.0599999999995s)]
*  and I was at the Cripple conference in August in Nashville because I care about it. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6938.379999999999s)]
*  I said, well, wait a second, I thought the promise of Bitcoin was autonomy. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6942.94s)]
*  And they're like, well, yeah, you can have autonomy. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6946.42s)]
*  And I said, well, how do you how about you make it easy for me [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6948.5s)]
*  to conduct business in Bitcoin, simple transactions, you know what I mean? [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6951.219999999999s)]
*  By Bitcoin, that's not a Tesla, you know, and and keep it private [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6954.46s)]
*  because it's my money. I made the money. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6959.42s)]
*  There's no reason the government should have any role in it at all. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6960.74s)]
*  I should be able to do it secretly. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6962.7s)]
*  And that's what you told me I was going to be able to do. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6963.86s)]
*  It's not just a pump and dump scheme. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6965.82s)]
*  You sleazeball. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6967.74s)]
*  It's not just about you getting rich and moving to Puerto Rico to pay no taxes. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6968.74s)]
*  It's about returning freedom to the population of the freest country in the world. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6971.9800000000005s)]
*  That's what you told me it was. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6976.06s)]
*  And they're like, well, you could do that, but you have to have a wallet. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6977.54s)]
*  I mean, it's just somebody. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6981.06s)]
*  And I think a lot of the Bitcoin people are totally sincere and great people. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6982.86s)]
*  And I'm not, you know, but somebody needs [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6985.86s)]
*  to make it easy for the average person to use Bitcoin as intended, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6989.22s)]
*  which is as a vehicle for financial freedom, as we would evade control. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6994.58s)]
*  Yeah, evade control. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6998.66s)]
*  To do that soon, I think. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=6999.66s)]
*  I like, well, what's happening in El Salvador? [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7001.34s)]
*  Isn't isn't a lot happening? That's great. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7004.58s)]
*  I mean, I again, I'm not attacking Bitcoin. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7006.860000000001s)]
*  And the promise of Bitcoin is the promise of freedom. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7009.3s)]
*  And I support it vehemently. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7011.38s)]
*  We need that because digital currency, they're already doing, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7013.38s)]
*  implementing it voluntarily. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7016.58s)]
*  Like you can. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7018.74s)]
*  They're going to track your carbon purchases on your credit card. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7020.42s)]
*  Have you seen this? No. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7023.3s)]
*  Yeah, they're starting to implement it voluntarily. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7024.46s)]
*  And they're going to let you know your carbon purchases. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7027.74s)]
*  And so they've already got a plan in place. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7030.66s)]
*  They've already have mechanisms to do this. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7033.34s)]
*  And so all they can say is, you know, I foresee a day not too far away [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7035.54s)]
*  where they say, hey, you know, you're we don't like how you're spending your money. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7039.86s)]
*  Of course, it's too much carbon. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7042.7s)]
*  So we're going to freeze. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7044.38s)]
*  And you can't spend it on the things you want to spend it on. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7045.3s)]
*  And you got to do this and you got to get an electric stove and electric [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7047.74s)]
*  stoves and we got to get electric car. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7051.14s)]
*  And where does the power for the electric car come from? [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7054.7s)]
*  A coal plant. And it's so no, no, actually a coal plant. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7056.78s)]
*  Yeah, I know. It's crazy. What's going on? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7059.86s)]
*  It's they they've been fed a bill of goods. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7062.1s)]
*  And by the way, the I read an article that said that if [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7064.74s)]
*  when you get like a Tesla or an electric car, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7070.42s)]
*  that's the equivalent of having 20 refrigerators in your house. Right. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7072.86s)]
*  So they already have an energy crisis. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7076.66s)]
*  I mean, whenever it gets it hits 90 degrees in California, they're like, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7079.34s)]
*  hey, everybody, be careful. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7082.54s)]
*  They can't handle the electric. The electric can't handle. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7084.22s)]
*  So if everybody got an electric car anyway, it would be you couldn't do it. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7086.62s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7090.62s)]
*  So this is all good. And this is just propaganda. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7091.66s)]
*  And the people who are telling you that you have to be tracked on your [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7093.7s)]
*  digital, your carbon footprint and drive electric cars and use electric stoves. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7098.26s)]
*  And you can't use a gas powered leaf blower anymore. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7102.18s)]
*  Are the same people who don't ban private jet travel, [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7105.66s)]
*  which is going through the roof, literally through the roof. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7108.86s)]
*  And they're like, and then they'll say, well, I buy carbon offsets. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7112.0199999999995s)]
*  No, but if you really thought global warming was real, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7115.0199999999995s)]
*  you wouldn't fly the private jet because you know that's contributing. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7117.46s)]
*  You would buy the carbon offset anyway. You would be trying to do so. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7120.34s)]
*  They won't. The people who keep telling me about this, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7123.22s)]
*  like John Kerry and Bill Gates, they don't they don't really believe it. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7125.54s)]
*  That's just not for one. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7130.1s)]
*  Even if you believe in carbon based climate change, [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7131.3s)]
*  any of their solutions are bullshit. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7136.34s)]
*  They're false prophets. They're fake clergy. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7138.58s)]
*  Yes. And I don't. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7140.9800000000005s)]
*  So after Russiagate, after Ukraine, after Syria, after COVID, [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7142.900000000001s)]
*  I don't believe anything that they say, including when it comes to climate change. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7148.3s)]
*  I don't believe them. Of course not. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7152.780000000001s)]
*  And it's just, it's about control. It's incumbent on them to prove it to me. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7154.74s)]
*  So my last question is to get a snapshot of where we think, [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7157.9s)]
*  where you think we're going. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7160.86s)]
*  Election is imminent. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7163.0199999999995s)]
*  How many people do you know, liberals, former progressive types, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7165.22s)]
*  are voting for Trump? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7170.5s)]
*  Well, the ones that come ones, ones that I meet do in comedy. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7173.139999999999s)]
*  Again, not many in Hollywood. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7178.74s)]
*  Still, really? No. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7181.0199999999995s)]
*  Come on. No, no, no. No. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7183.26s)]
*  I mean, I've had people, I'll have people secretly admit to me [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7185.82s)]
*  they got vaccine injured, secretly. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7189.299999999999s)]
*  They won't say it out loud. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7191.259999999999s)]
*  Like I'll come off stage and they'll be a famous comedian. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7192.94s)]
*  I won't say. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7195.9s)]
*  And they'll say, yeah, I got shingles in my eye [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7197.179999999999s)]
*  when I got the vaccine and stuff like that. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7200.38s)]
*  And I'm like, you don't talk about it? No. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7202.42s)]
*  Oh, I've had people email me and say, hey, keep talking about it. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7204.9s)]
*  I got myocarditis. No way. Yes. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7207.74s)]
*  So they've so internalized the guilt and shame from CNN [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7211.0599999999995s)]
*  that they can't even admit that they were a victim of a crime. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7214.06s)]
*  They don't want to be ostracized from polite society. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7216.740000000001s)]
*  I mean, you can't do that. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7219.700000000001s)]
*  How is it different from a woman saying I was gang raped, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7220.740000000001s)]
*  but I can't tell anybody because I'll be blamed for it? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7222.9800000000005s)]
*  That's sick. It's sick. It is sick. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7225.18s)]
*  I agree with you. So, you know, my audience is different. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7227.54s)]
*  So when I go out and I travel, I meet all types of people. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7231.780000000001s)]
*  People come to my audience, come to my shows and I meet them. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7234.660000000001s)]
*  And they they range from hippies to ex-military, [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7237.860000000001s)]
*  to police, to firemen, to labor organizers, to nurses, to teachers. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7241.9s)]
*  And so they're all done. Right. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7248.34s)]
*  So they're done definitely with the liberal intelligentsia. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7250.58s)]
*  And they see through it. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7254.139999999999s)]
*  But I don't know if that necessarily means they're going to vote for Donald Trump. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7256.66s)]
*  But they are certainly done with. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7261.58s)]
*  When Trump invites Sean O'Brien, head of the Teamsters, to the Republican [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7263.22s)]
*  convention and doesn't even make him endorse Trump, [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7266.46s)]
*  Sean O'Brien does not come as a Republican or a Trump voter. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7270.5s)]
*  And he says that from the stage. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7273.38s)]
*  I'm not a Trump voter. I'm not a Republican. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7276.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm not here to endorse Trump. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7277.82s)]
*  But he invited me and I'm coming. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7279.58s)]
*  How is that not the most powerful sign ever? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7281.54s)]
*  Can you imagine letting someone at your convention who won't even endorse you [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7284.86s)]
*  and you let him come anyway? [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7289.259999999999s)]
*  That is a sign that that this party would ever its many flaws, many flaws. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7290.9s)]
*  But is the open party, is the actual coalition of different people, [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7296.219999999999s)]
*  different interests, but with a common humanity and Americanness? [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7301.58s)]
*  Like, doesn't that just tell you everything? [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7305.139999999999s)]
*  It's I've made a big deal out of it. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7306.9s)]
*  Oh, did you? Oh, good. Yeah. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7309.339999999999s)]
*  And it was kind of ignored, I thought. Yeah, certainly. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7310.46s)]
*  Of course, that's not good for the establishment. Yeah. And [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7313.139999999999s)]
*  you know, you saw that the port workers, right, they were not striking. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7317.219999999999s)]
*  They shut that strike down immediately because they had to settle it [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7320.46s)]
*  because that's not good. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7323.219999999999s)]
*  And they don't want they don't want other you. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7324.06s)]
*  They don't want unions to catch on. Right. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7325.900000000001s)]
*  So as soon as the workers start to get power, they got to stop it. Right. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7327.46s)]
*  And that's why they have an open border. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7331.46s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7333.5s)]
*  There's a little bit of a tightening of the labor market. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7335.18s)]
*  The workers are starting to get a little bit of power. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7338.5s)]
*  They completely flooded. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7340.42s)]
*  And the but the liberals who I see who aren't voting for Kamala Harris. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7342.02s)]
*  So they're going to vote for Trump or they're going to vote for Jill Stein. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7346.22s)]
*  Yeah, right. That's better. We put it aren't voting for Kamala Harris. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7348.900000000001s)]
*  Right. So they're not voting. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7351.86s)]
*  They want to punish the Democrats. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7353.0599999999995s)]
*  They think they need to be punished. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7356.179999999999s)]
*  And I agree. I think they do need to be punished. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7358.0599999999995s)]
*  They will not come to get your vote. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7360.7s)]
*  They have they don't care. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7362.259999999999s)]
*  You know, you you I'm sure you saw Chuck Schumer in 2016 [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7363.42s)]
*  when they said, hey, what about you're losing blue collar workers? [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7368.38s)]
*  Right. Hillary Clinton, you lose. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7370.98s)]
*  He said, it doesn't matter for every blue collar worker we lose. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7372.58s)]
*  We're going to pick up two white collar suburban voters. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7375.82s)]
*  And you can repeat that in Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7378.38s)]
*  Well, I guess they couldn't do that. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7381.66s)]
*  That was a lot. But that's just so they he's that was at the time, [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7383.38s)]
*  the leader of the Democratic Party out there telling people [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7386.66s)]
*  we are not trying to appeal to workers. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7389.7s)]
*  We're literally trying to appeal to white collar Republicans. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7391.86s)]
*  That's what the Democratic Party is now. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7395.5s)]
*  They will bend over backwards to get white collar. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7397.82s)]
*  That's why Liz Cheney is touring with Kamala Harris. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7400.22s)]
*  Has there ever been anyone that as disgusting as Liz Cheney in world history? [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7403.139999999999s)]
*  I can't think of any. I can't. I can't. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7407.0199999999995s)]
*  But that's what that's what does that tell you? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7409.34s)]
*  They're not going after workers. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7411.38s)]
*  They're not going after their natural constituency Democrats. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7412.9400000000005s)]
*  They're going after white collar suburban Republicans. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7416.02s)]
*  That's what they're trying to do. And they'll bend over backwards for them. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7419.06s)]
*  They won't do anything to get the Muslim vote, [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7422.02s)]
*  which you would think would be a natural constituency. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7424.66s)]
*  They won't do a damn thing for them. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7427.06s)]
*  And that's why they all just came out in Michigan and endorsed Donald Trump. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7430.3s)]
*  At least Donald Trump. They won't do anything. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7433.7s)]
*  So I'm always you got to make them come get your vote. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7436.58s)]
*  And you've got to punish them for turning their back on workers, [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7440.86s)]
*  for funding a genocide and for forcing medical experiments on people [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7443.86s)]
*  and for and for censoring and shutting down and shaming people for questioning. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7449.0599999999995s)]
*  You've got to punish them. And I'm all for that. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7453.46s)]
*  And so a lot of people are punishing them by voting for Jill Stein. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7456.22s)]
*  Some of them are voting for Donald Trump to punish them. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7458.9s)]
*  I say whatever you can do to punish the Democratic Party. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7461.26s)]
*  We got to break them. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7464.139999999999s)]
*  The Great Jimmy Dore. Thank you. OK, thank you. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7466.179999999999s)]
*  So it turns out that you two. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURLfCVjQ5E&t=7470.7s)]
