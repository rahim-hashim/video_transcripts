# Tucker & Piers Morgan Debate Foreign Aid, Hate Speech, NATO, Gun Control, & Is Zelensky a Dictator?
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc)
*  Here's Morgan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1.28s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  Telling off-color jokes off-camera. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5.32s)]
*  No, my pleasure. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=6.32s)]
*  We are in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=7.32s)]
*  We are. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=8.32s)]
*  I'm not even going to ask you how you wind up here, but I'm glad to see you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=9.32s)]
*  Well, we're both here for the same reason, actually. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=12.44s)]
*  We've both gone into the oil business. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=17.32s)]
*  I never, yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=18.32s)]
*  So, I want to ask you, I want to start just on a very hostile note, okay? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=19.32s)]
*  Because I feel like that's a good way to frame it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=24.48s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=25.96s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=26.96s)]
*  Let's start with me to continue. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=27.96s)]
*  Slensky is a hero. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=28.96s)]
*  How could you say that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  I don't agree with you about him or Ukraine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  It's a lot more complicated. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=84.48s)]
*  I know the history, but a lot of very smart people on, a lot of people you've interviewed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=85.8s)]
*  And I do learn a lot each time I talk to them about all the history, obviously. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  My brother was a British Army colonel. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=94.76s)]
*  My sister married a British Army colonel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  They've all engaged in conflicts around the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=98.16s)]
*  And so, it's complicated. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=100.92s)]
*  There's no doubt that on the Russian side, they believe they were provoking to do this. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=102.76s)]
*  I know that you have sympathy with that view. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=105.92s)]
*  There's also no doubt from the Ukrainian side that they believe since the 90s, they've been [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  this sovereign democratic country, albeit not perfect. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=112.4s)]
*  You think deeply flawed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  I think they've been imperfect trying to improve. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=117.56s)]
*  And Zelensky has actually, I think, been a force for good, not bad. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=120.12s)]
*  But ultimately, what's happened now is that you have a situation where, as Donald Trump [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=124.48s)]
*  told me recently, it's just the mowing fields now, where you have thousands of young men [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=131.32s)]
*  being killed, often on a daily basis, both sides. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=139.52s)]
*  And no one's winning this war, it seems to me. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=143.16s)]
*  And if anyone is going to win, it's likely to be Russia, not Ukraine. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=145.12s)]
*  And then what happens? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=149.08s)]
*  And that concerns me enormously. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=150.9s)]
*  If the West allows Putin to just take the land he's taken, what guarantee do we have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  he won't try and take the rest of Ukraine? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=159.28s)]
*  He took Crimea. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=161.74s)]
*  He's back for more. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=162.78s)]
*  I think he wants the whole of Ukraine. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=163.86s)]
*  I think he won't stop there if he's allowed to get it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=165.44s)]
*  I think he's a pretty ruthless, evil Russian dictator. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=167.32s)]
*  How are we defining, just to find the terms so we can follow the same thing, what's a dictator? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=170.32s)]
*  A dictator to me is somebody, well, I would start by saying you have no respect for democratic [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=177.52s)]
*  norms, a free and fair election. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=185.4s)]
*  So like an unelected leader would be a dictator. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=188.08s)]
*  Well, you wouldn't argue that Putin, for example, has free and fair elections? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=190.12s)]
*  No, I'm not that interested actually. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  Are you not? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  Not really. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not my country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm interested in my leaders, whether they have the consent of their people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not of great interest to me. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  I do think Putin's way more popular than Joe Biden. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  To his people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=212.76s)]
*  Yes, more popular in Russia than Biden was ever popular. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=213.76s)]
*  I wouldn't dispute that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  But why are you so against Zelensky? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  No, I'm just trying to understand when you dismiss Putin as a dictator, which is totally [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=218.68s)]
*  fair, I guess, but I'm just trying to understand what you mean by dictator. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=223.36s)]
*  So the first criterion for dictatorship is that you're not elected. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=226.44000000000003s)]
*  And what else? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=230.88000000000002s)]
*  Because Zelensky is obviously not elected either. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=231.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just trying to kind of figure out what you're talking about. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, your comparison with Zelensky and Putin over the last two years, I found baffling [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=238.36s)]
*  because you seem to think there's some moral equivalence between the two. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=243.24s)]
*  And Zelensky hasn't illegally invaded another country. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  Do you not have a problem with what Putin's done? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=249.24s)]
*  Hold on, I just want to know what a dictator is. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=252.32s)]
*  I just want to know. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, maybe he's a better guy than Putin or whatever. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  And you could say some things about one or nothing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=257.52s)]
*  But if we're just going to define dictator, the first feature of a dictator is he's not elected. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=259.88s)]
*  So Zelensky is not elected. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=265.72s)]
*  He's also, well, he's banned a religious denomination. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=267.44s)]
*  He's murdered his political opponents. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=270.88s)]
*  He has banned a language group. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=273.32s)]
*  Those all seem like features of dictatorship to me. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=277.12s)]
*  Now, he has the support of the British intelligence agencies. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=279.36s)]
*  That doesn't mean he's not a dictator, though. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=283.0s)]
*  That sounds like a dictator. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=285.04s)]
*  I mean, if I gave you a piece of paper and I'm like, here are some qualities of a European [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=286.04s)]
*  leader, you would say, well, that guy, that's not legitimate. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=290.16s)]
*  That guy's a dictator. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=293.04s)]
*  I can't support that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=294.04s)]
*  But his name is Zelensky. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=295.04s)]
*  And he was once a comedian and he does my show. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=296.04s)]
*  So he's not a dictator. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=298.48s)]
*  I think it's a dictator. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=299.48s)]
*  Well, I would argue that if you look at the history of Ukraine since the 90s, since it [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=300.76s)]
*  became a, one of a better phrase, democratic country, as they would say, well, I mean, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=307.0s)]
*  by the same criteria you support Putin being popular in his country, I think just under [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=312.64s)]
*  90% of Ukrainians voted for it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=316.84s)]
*  You wouldn't dispute that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, first of all, the country had a coup sponsored by the United States government, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  the CIA in 2014. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=326.12s)]
*  So everything that happened subsequent to that, I don't think we could call part of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  the democratic process. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  But just Zelensky personally is not elected. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=333.56s)]
*  He's not an elected leader. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=336.92s)]
*  He rules by force. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=338.32s)]
*  There's no election that gives him legitimacy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=340.12s)]
*  So that's not a defense of Putin. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=342.66s)]
*  It's merely an attack on the idea that Putin is the only dictator in this contest. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  How is Zelensky not a dictator? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=349.48s)]
*  Do you think Putin is a dictator? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=350.76s)]
*  I guess, yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=352.8s)]
*  I mean, I guess. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=353.8s)]
*  I mean, if I stand up outside the Kremlin and say down with Vladimir Putin, I'm probably [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=354.8s)]
*  in trouble. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=358.72s)]
*  That's why I don't live in Russia. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=359.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=360.72s)]
*  I certainly think that Ukraine has had a lot of corruption. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=361.72s)]
*  No, no, but is Zelensky legitimate? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=363.36s)]
*  How is he legitimate if he's not elected? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=365.24s)]
*  How could you support an unelected leader? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=366.84s)]
*  Well, he's the president of the country. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=368.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, he calls himself that, but there's no election that made him president. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=369.56s)]
*  He blew past the election and said, oh, there's a war. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  We can't have an election. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=375.32s)]
*  We're going to change the Constitution. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=376.76s)]
*  So how is that a legitimate leader? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  How could you support something like that? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=380.12s)]
*  That seems, I don't know, like a dictatorship. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=381.44s)]
*  Well, I would categorize my support for him as supporting him against an illegal invasion [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=383.32s)]
*  by Russia. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  So this is like why we support Stalin against Hitler because Hitler's bad, so Stalin must [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  be good. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=393.12s)]
*  But no, Stalin's also a dictator. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=394.12s)]
*  So like, how about we just don't support dictators if we're against supporting dictators? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  Or you could take my position, which is I don't want a dictatorship in my own country [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  because I live in a free country, but we're going to have relations with a country that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=401.76000000000005s)]
*  helps us most, up to a certain limit. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=405.08000000000004s)]
*  We're not going to be allies with Stalin because that's too evil. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=407.12s)]
*  We're not Winston Churchill or FDR or something. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=410.44000000000005s)]
*  We're not going to go that far. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=413.92s)]
*  But in general, we will deal with countries that help us. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=414.92s)]
*  But when we start having moral conversations about other countries, then we have to stick [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=417.94000000000005s)]
*  by our own standards. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=421.06s)]
*  And by your standard, you're supporting a dictator. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=422.06s)]
*  I wonder how you can do that, Pierce Morgan. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=423.84s)]
*  I'm not saying they're morally pure in Ukraine. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=425.64s)]
*  I'm not saying they're not riddled with corruption. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=427.8s)]
*  But how is he not a dictator? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  No, no, here's my point to you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  My defense of them... [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  Bloodthirsty dictator. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  Bloodthirsty dictator. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  My defense of them is based on the illegal invasion by Russia. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  You and I can argue about whether Russia was goaded and provoked into doing that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=439.08s)]
*  I do not think anything justifies what they actually did. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=442.48s)]
*  Okay, that's a totally fair position. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=445.96s)]
*  I mean, I guess I disagree, sort of, but I don't think what you're saying is crazy at [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  all. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=451.88s)]
*  I mean, it's not more illegal than running a country without an election and banning [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=452.88s)]
*  a religious denomination. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=456.08s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=457.08s)]
*  So yeah, you could certainly say Putin did a lot of bad things. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=458.56s)]
*  I would readily agree to that to the extent I understand it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  But we're supporting my government and your government particularly are supporting this [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=465.08s)]
*  dictator in Ukraine who's oppressing Christians, who is banning people's native language and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=469.08s)]
*  books in their native language. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=475.42s)]
*  He's a book burner. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  And like, that's totally cool because we hate Putin. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  That's not totally cool, is it? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=480.68s)]
*  So would you just let Putin take Ukraine? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=481.68s)]
*  I would say let's have an election in Ukraine and let the Ukrainian people elect their own [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=483.72s)]
*  leader and get rid of the midget dictator who now oppresses them, Zelensky. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  And I would definitely not support a guy who's not elected as a democratic figure because [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=491.96s)]
*  by definition he's not. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=497.32s)]
*  By definition. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=499.48s)]
*  I don't care who his enemies are. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=500.48s)]
*  He's not worth calling a beacon of democracy if he doesn't even have an, why not have an [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=501.88s)]
*  election in Ukraine today? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=507.4s)]
*  Because we've got a war. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=508.56s)]
*  We had elections in our country during the Second World War. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=510.14s)]
*  So did you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=512.58s)]
*  Like, why not hold him to democratic standards? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=513.58s)]
*  I've got no problem with saying he should have an election. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=516.9399999999999s)]
*  What about banning a Christian denomination? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=519.1s)]
*  Yeah, I don't agree with any of those things. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=520.58s)]
*  Well, how could we ever support that? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=522.6999999999999s)]
*  Because ultimately- [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=524.76s)]
*  We're paying for that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=525.76s)]
*  Because ultimately we have to make a calculation about whether we're happy with Russia invading [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=526.76s)]
*  what is a sovereign European democratic country. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=530.42s)]
*  Well, it's not a sovereign country. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=533.18s)]
*  It was controlled by the United States. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=535.38s)]
*  We installed their government in a coup in 2014. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=537.22s)]
*  It's a very puppet of the United States and Great Britain. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=539.14s)]
*  They are not sovereign. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=541.54s)]
*  Do you think they're a democracy? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=542.54s)]
*  Well their leader's not elected, so by definition they're not a democracy. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=544.54s)]
*  It may be a great place to vacation or they've got, you know, we're getting a lot of money [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=547.98s)]
*  from, you know, defense deals or they've got pretty women. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=551.02s)]
*  There are lots of great things you could say about the Ukrainians. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=553.14s)]
*  They're actually great people from what I can tell. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=554.9s)]
*  I know a bunch of them. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=556.4200000000001s)]
*  They're awesome. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=557.4200000000001s)]
*  But they're definitely not a democracy. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=558.7s)]
*  Should Putin just take the land? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=560.26s)]
*  No. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=561.98s)]
*  So what happens? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=562.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=564.46s)]
*  I mean, he's not paying for the slaughter of the entire Ukrainian population. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=565.6600000000001s)]
*  Because he don't know. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=568.1s)]
*  I mean, either he's allowed to take it or he isn't. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=569.1s)]
*  Either we now say, yes, you take it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=571.7s)]
*  Why is it up to us? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=572.9000000000001s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=573.9000000000001s)]
*  We're not in... [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=574.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, who else can stop it? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=575.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=576.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, when, you know, Congo invades its neighbors, like it's not axiomatic that we should be [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=577.9000000000001s)]
*  involved in that. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=583.58s)]
*  Well, when Saddam invaded Kuwait, why did America go and support that? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=584.58s)]
*  Because there's oil here. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=588.0600000000001s)]
*  Did you support that? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, I was in college and drunk. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=590.0600000000001s)]
*  Did you basically agree with it? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=591.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=593.14s)]
*  I mean, I had a lot of dumb ideas. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=594.14s)]
*  I thought it was okay to drink beer in the morning. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=595.8199999999999s)]
*  Do you think looking back at it, was it right to do what America did with the Allies? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=598.3s)]
*  British were there too? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=601.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=602.9399999999999s)]
*  Expel him from Kuwait? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=603.9399999999999s)]
*  It wasn't a NATO country. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=604.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, that was... [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=607.46s)]
*  I mean, that's the kind of war that in theory I would support. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=608.46s)]
*  You say, we have, you know, energy interests in this region. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=611.74s)]
*  We want to keep it stable. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=615.1s)]
*  When you start getting theoretical, like we're preserving democracy by supporting dictators... [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=616.66s)]
*  Well, we take energy from Ukraine, though. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=620.42s)]
*  There's an energy component to that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=622.18s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=624.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't see the... [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=625.3000000000001s)]
*  What I'm thinking is that the... [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=626.3000000000001s)]
*  My own like is the moral overlay because it's fatuous and fraudulent. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=627.3000000000001s)]
*  He's not... [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=630.94s)]
*  This is not a democratic country. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=631.94s)]
*  He is a dictator. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=632.94s)]
*  We've supported many dictators. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=634.1s)]
*  We supported Mobutu in Zaire, which no longer exists because he was a bulwark against the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=635.26s)]
*  Soviets we thought, and a million others. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=640.3000000000001s)]
*  But you've already said that you would support the expulsion of Saddam from Kuwait. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=641.62s)]
*  I don't know that I would. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=646.38s)]
*  Led by America. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=647.38s)]
*  Well, you just said you did, right? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=648.38s)]
*  So... [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=649.38s)]
*  No, I said I was drunk in college. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=650.38s)]
*  I haven't really thought... [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=651.38s)]
*  Theoretically, you could make the case... [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=652.54s)]
*  Because they had energy. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=654.22s)]
*  ...We need cheap energy. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=655.22s)]
*  We're going to go to war to preserve cheap energy. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=656.22s)]
*  You know, that's not a crazy thing to say. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=657.7s)]
*  Maybe I could support that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=659.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=660.46s)]
*  So what's the difference, I'll tell you, between that and what's happened with Russia and Ukraine? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=661.46s)]
*  Well, because... [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=663.78s)]
*  We need Ukraine's energy. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=664.78s)]
*  The justification has... [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=665.78s)]
*  We need Ukraine's wheat. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=666.78s)]
*  We do. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=667.78s)]
*  25% of the world's wheat comes out of Ukraine. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=668.78s)]
*  I'm aware, which is why you probably don't want to kill all of its farmers and sell all [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=671.02s)]
*  of its farmland, which is what we've allowed to happen. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=674.82s)]
*  Zelensky... [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=677.66s)]
*  We're not kidding. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=678.66s)]
*  The Russians are. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=679.66s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=680.66s)]
*  This war wouldn't exist if it weren't for the money and arms that we're sending to Ukraine. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=681.78s)]
*  It would have been over in one day. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=685.5s)]
*  It never would have started if we hadn't said... [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=686.5s)]
*  When you say over, what do you mean? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=688.38s)]
*  What would have happened? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=689.38s)]
*  I don't think... [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=691.14s)]
*  I think it's very clear, and I don't know that anyone would disagree with this, that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=692.14s)]
*  Russia would not have invaded eastern Ukraine if the Biden administration hadn't sent Kamala [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=694.54s)]
*  Harris to the Munich Security Conference in February of 2022 to say to Zelensky, on camera, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=699.66s)]
*  we're going to make you a NATO country, meaning we're going to put American NATO arms on the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=705.6999999999999s)]
*  Russian border. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=710.06s)]
*  Like you would not allow Chinese... [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=711.8199999999999s)]
*  Your country probably would, but you shouldn't allow Chinese missiles in Scotland peering [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=714.5s)]
*  over Hadrian's Wall aimed at London. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=719.06s)]
*  You'd be like, no, you can't do that on our border. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=721.7399999999999s)]
*  And the Russians are like, no, you can't do that on our border. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=725.5799999999999s)]
*  And we're like, shut up, you're Russian. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=727.5799999999999s)]
*  You have no right to determine what happens on your border. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=729.14s)]
*  Piss off. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=731.54s)]
*  But if... [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=732.54s)]
*  I mean, is that actually happening? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=733.54s)]
*  My point is, if the defense of expelling Saddam Hussein from Kuwait was that we have energy [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=736.06s)]
*  interests in that country... [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=742.06s)]
*  Well, no one ever said... [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=743.54s)]
*  And therefore we should kick him out, but that's obviously what we all knew, and it [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=744.54s)]
*  was done very quickly and competently by General Norman Shortsgolf, and it was great, great [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=746.8199999999999s)]
*  military operation. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=751.3s)]
*  But surely the principle and ideology is not different. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=752.3s)]
*  And what's interesting is every Republican... [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=755.38s)]
*  Every Republican back in... [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=759.02s)]
*  Yeah, but they're idiots. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=760.02s)]
*  They support the Ukraine. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=761.02s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=762.02s)]
*  I mean, every Republican in 91 would have supported that conflict. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=763.02s)]
*  Well, whether or not... [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=766.34s)]
*  Whereas now... [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=768.42s)]
*  Republican members of the Senate support something is immaterial, so my support of it I can promise [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=769.42s)]
*  you. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=772.54s)]
*  Well, every Republican voter, I think, would have supported it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=773.54s)]
*  Whereas what's interesting... [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=774.54s)]
*  35 years ago, I'm just saying... [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=775.54s)]
*  So what's changed is a lot of Republican supporters now, conservatives in America, are against [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=776.54s)]
*  supporting Ukraine anymore. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=781.98s)]
*  And I'm curious about that change in what has been, what, 35 years. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=783.6999999999999s)]
*  There's been a real sea change. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=788.02s)]
*  And it made me because Americans are understandably war-weary. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=789.7800000000001s)]
*  They're fed up with spending a lot of money on foreign wars, foreign conflicts. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=793.26s)]
*  There's a good argument America hasn't really won a foreign war since World War II. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=797.7800000000001s)]
*  You look at from Vietnam onwards, endless quagmars, endless problems, Iraq, Afghanistan, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=801.6600000000001s)]
*  and so on and so on. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=807.74s)]
*  And I look at what's happened in Ukraine, and I'm just looking at it pragmatically. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=809.5400000000001s)]
*  Do we just let a Russian, do we let Russia, led at the moment by Vladimir Putin, who I [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=814.22s)]
*  would categorize as a dictator, do we let him just take what he wants, even if he uses [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=820.26s)]
*  it and dresses it all up as, I'm doing this because I fear about NATO encroachment, which [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=826.5s)]
*  may well be his reasoning. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=830.94s)]
*  May well be his reasoning. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=833.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=834.02s)]
*  But many people think it's not his reasoning. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=835.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=836.02s)]
*  Many people think... [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=837.02s)]
*  They think... [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=838.02s)]
*  Why would you want to put US missiles on Russia's border? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=839.02s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=841.9s)]
*  Because the other thing... [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=842.9s)]
*  It's not acceptable for any sovereign nation to tolerate that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=844.5799999999999s)]
*  Here's the other part of the argument. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=846.22s)]
*  He has nuclear weapons. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=847.62s)]
*  Why would we want that? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=848.62s)]
*  A lot of people... [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=849.62s)]
*  Confused. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=850.62s)]
*  We have nuclear weapons too. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=851.62s)]
*  A lot of the argument... [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=852.62s)]
*  Do you guys have nuclear weapons? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=853.62s)]
*  Huh? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=854.62s)]
*  We do. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=855.62s)]
*  Nuclear... [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=856.62s)]
*  Yes, we have nuclear weapons. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=857.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=858.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=859.62s)]
*  Nuclear deterrent. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=860.62s)]
*  Great Britain has nuclear weapons? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=861.62s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=862.62s)]
*  Do you think that's a good idea? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=863.62s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=865.22s)]
*  You know why? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=866.22s)]
*  You're freaking me out. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=867.22s)]
*  If Ukraine had nuclear weapons, they wouldn't have been invaded. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=868.54s)]
*  Can we agree on that? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=872.0600000000001s)]
*  We told them to give up their nuclear deterrent. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=873.9s)]
*  They wouldn't have been invaded if the West hadn't said, we're going to use you as a staging [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=875.62s)]
*  ground for intimidating Russia. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=880.26s)]
*  Why would we want to do that? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=882.38s)]
*  Why not just allow... [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=883.62s)]
*  What we've done is pushed Russia into the Chinese military. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=884.9s)]
*  Many people would say... [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=886.82s)]
*  How does that help us? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=887.82s)]
*  Many people in that region say actually what's happened to Ukraine is precisely why they [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=888.82s)]
*  should have been in NATO. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=893.38s)]
*  Because if they had been in NATO, Putin wouldn't have invaded them. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=894.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=897.38s)]
*  And also they say... [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=898.38s)]
*  Many people say that. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=899.38s)]
*  If we hadn't collectively basically bullied Ukraine into giving up their nuclear deterrent, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=900.78s)]
*  he wouldn't have done it either because they would have had a nuclear weapon to defend [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=906.1s)]
*  themselves. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=908.54s)]
*  This is super crazy. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=909.54s)]
*  Is it crazy? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=910.54s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=911.54s)]
*  Crazier than your theories? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=912.54s)]
*  Well, actually, I don't think... [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=913.54s)]
*  I mean, I have a million theories, but these are not among them. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=915.38s)]
*  It's not a theory to say that Russia moved into Eastern Ukraine because the United States [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=919.04s)]
*  wouldn't give up on pushing for Ukraine admission into NATO when NATO did not want Ukraine. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=923.5s)]
*  Is it also... [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=929.1s)]
*  The criteria for admission. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=930.1s)]
*  But I think you're only giving half a picture. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=931.1s)]
*  I'm not oblivious to that, but I would add this component to it, which is also not surely [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=933.38s)]
*  beyond the realms of fantasy. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=938.26s)]
*  Vladimir Putin knows that a lot of that part of Eastern Ukraine, they still speak Russian. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=940.02s)]
*  He has resented the breakup of the Soviet Union, famously, and that actually he wanted [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=944.4200000000001s)]
*  to take back land that he believes should belong to Russia. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=949.82s)]
*  Should belong to Russia. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=954.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=955.1s)]
*  In general, possessions are overrated, but there are some things you really would not [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=956.1s)]
*  want stolen. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=960.46s)]
*  And to me, family shotguns, including a whole bunch of them I got from my father, are at [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=961.94s)]
*  the top of that list. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=967.4200000000001s)]
*  So I keep my dad's shotguns in a Liberty Safe because it's safe and it's also really attractive. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=968.74s)]
*  Liberty Safe just created something really cool. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=976.26s)]
*  It's a limited edition safe that commemorates the inauguration of Donald Trump, America's [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=977.94s)]
*  47th president. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=982.5s)]
*  The original design celebrates Trump and his swearing in while upholding Liberty's commitment [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=984.06s)]
*  to building their safes right here in the United States. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=988.9s)]

*  Okay. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1043.98s)]
*  Do you accept that? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1044.98s)]
*  I think it's true of... [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1045.98s)]
*  Look, I'm not an expert. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1046.98s)]
*  I've interviewed Putin. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1048.26s)]
*  You know, I've been there a couple of times. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1049.26s)]
*  I don't speak Russian, so I hope I don't get over my skis and pretend to know things that [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1051.22s)]
*  I don't. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1055.18s)]
*  But what's very obvious is they have an interest and have for over 300 years in controlling [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1056.18s)]
*  Crimea, where their fleet is based. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1061.7s)]
*  They had a referendum in Crimea. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1065.44s)]
*  The people of Crimea are Russian and want to remain part of the Russian Federation. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1066.58s)]
*  So he didn't take Crimea. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1071.76s)]
*  It's Russian. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1074.3s)]
*  It's filled with Russians. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1075.3s)]
*  They had a referendum that nobody disputes. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1076.3s)]
*  People should be allowed to choose their own government. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1078.4199999999998s)]
*  That's the basic precept of democracy. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1080.54s)]
*  You didn't take Crimea. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1081.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1083.4199999999998s)]
*  Should people be allowed to choose their own government? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1084.4199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1087.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1088.06s)]
*  So the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly to align with the Russian government. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1089.06s)]
*  So that's illegitimate. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1092.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1093.78s)]
*  When did they do that? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1094.78s)]
*  Right after the coup in 15, I think. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1095.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1100.06s)]
*  So after they'd been invaded. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1101.06s)]
*  Why do you think so many Russians vote for Putin in Russia? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1102.06s)]
*  I don't think it was invaded. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1106.54s)]
*  Russia has controlled Crimea for 300 years. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1108.1399999999999s)]
*  It wasn't Russia's. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1111.82s)]
*  And in the same way that you say the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly in favor, of [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1115.58s)]
*  course they did. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1120.06s)]
*  They would have been killed if they hadn't. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1121.06s)]
*  Same way as in Russia. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1122.06s)]
*  In a secret ballot? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1123.06s)]
*  Same way Russia. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1124.06s)]
*  So you're saying that the election was conducted under duress and people's votes were known [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1125.34s)]
*  to the Russian government? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1131.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1132.1399999999999s)]
*  I think it was a secret ballot. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1133.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm saying it's exactly the same way that people in Russia vote for Putin. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1134.1399999999999s)]
*  You think it's an overwhelming show of support for him. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1137.3s)]
*  A lot of it is driven by fear. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1139.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1140.8999999999999s)]
*  That may or may not be true. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1141.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1142.8999999999999s)]
*  But the only measure we have of popular consent is an election. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1143.8999999999999s)]
*  And when conducted by secret ballot, if we think it's not the 2020 election, it's like [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1147.62s)]
*  kind of a legitimate election, that's what we go with. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1151.6599999999999s)]
*  Have you ever met anybody who believes that if a free and fair referendum were held once [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1155.3400000000001s)]
*  again in Ukraine, that Ukraine would vote, rather than Crimeans would vote to align with [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1162.5400000000002s)]
*  Zelensky government in Kiev? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1170.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1172.02s)]
*  It was 97%. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1173.02s)]
*  Look, I'm just saying self-determination is the core idea in democracy. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1174.02s)]
*  They don't have it in Ukraine because they haven't had an election. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1178.7800000000002s)]
*  They ignore the election because it's run by a dictator called Zelensky. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1181.74s)]
*  If you wanted to say he's a dictator, that's fine. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1185.98s)]
*  You support a dictator. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1188.06s)]
*  The US, your government has supported many dictators, so has mine. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1189.06s)]
*  That's kind of a fact of life. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1192.22s)]
*  There are very few democratically elected leaders. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1193.22s)]
*  Sometimes even our leaders aren't really democratically elected, as you know. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1195.06s)]
*  I just don't like the moral bullshit that attaches to all of this. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1198.02s)]
*  That's fair enough. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1201.6200000000001s)]
*  Where we tell the population, we're on the side of democracy, and he's Winston Churchill. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1202.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't claim his mother Theresa against him. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1206.02s)]
*  No, but you have, though. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1209.02s)]
*  He's a marvelous person. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1210.5s)]
*  I like him. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1212.18s)]
*  I'm allowed to, aren't I? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1213.18s)]
*  I guess you like dictators. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1214.46s)]
*  I've never said a Putin is a marvelous person because it's a little dictator-y for me. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1216.7s)]
*  I think he's really smart. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1221.02s)]
*  I admire what he's done to Russia, but I'm not going to sniff his jock because he's kind [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1222.1399999999999s)]
*  of a dictator. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1226.42s)]
*  But you're like, oh, I love that Zelensky. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1227.42s)]
*  He's so great. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1229.66s)]
*  I do like him. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1230.66s)]
*  How can you like a man who's a dictator? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1231.66s)]
*  I don't think he's a dictator. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1233.7s)]
*  In what sense? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1234.94s)]
*  He's not elected. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1235.94s)]
*  He rules by force. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1238.1s)]
*  He rules with guns. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1239.1799999999998s)]
*  He kills his opponents. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1240.62s)]
*  He's assassinated a ton of people, including, you know, I know someone he tried to assassinate. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1242.3s)]
*  In fact, how is that worth supporting? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1247.54s)]
*  Do you feel a little guilty for supporting someone like that? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1250.06s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1252.26s)]
*  Really? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1253.26s)]
*  No, I think we should try and do more to help him win. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1254.26s)]
*  How rich do you think he's gotten from this war? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1256.06s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1258.74s)]
*  Does it bother you that he's gotten rich? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1259.9399999999998s)]
*  He's not as rich as Vladimir Putin. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1261.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, if all comparisons are to Putin, then all bets are off. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1263.34s)]
*  Putin's financially raped and pillaged his country for 30 years. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1267.7s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1270.3000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1271.3000000000002s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1272.3000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1273.3000000000002s)]
*  Okay, let's see. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1274.3000000000002s)]
*  He's got a personal net worth of a hundred billion rubles, whatever it is. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1275.3000000000002s)]
*  We would know that, but great, he does. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1278.02s)]
*  He's evil. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1280.66s)]
*  We'll stick with that. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1281.66s)]
*  But the question is, why would you support personally a dictator who's gotten rich on [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1283.3000000000002s)]
*  a war in his country, who bans a Christian denomination and who murders his political [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1289.38s)]
*  opponents? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1293.38s)]
*  Would he literally only be in the- [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1294.38s)]
*  Does that bother you at all? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1295.38s)]
*  He's been in the country for two years. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1296.8600000000001s)]
*  He's done a lot of oppression in two years. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1297.8600000000001s)]
*  He didn't get rich on corruption in two years. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1301.22s)]
*  But can I ask you, when you talk to Zelensky- [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1303.1000000000001s)]
*  Putin's been doing this for 30 years. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1304.74s)]

*  To keep the Soviets from invading Western Europe? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1553.66s)]
*  Oh well, it's been 35 years since they existed. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1554.9s)]
*  Actually, to keep peace. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1556.9s)]
*  How's that worked? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1558.8200000000002s)]
*  To keep peace? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1559.8200000000002s)]
*  We now have the bloodiest war in 80 years in the middle of Europe because of NATO. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1560.8200000000002s)]
*  So how's this peacekeeping actually- [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1566.42s)]
*  Or you could argue, as many people do, that actually the reason is because Ukraine wasn't [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1567.66s)]
*  in NATO. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1572.42s)]

*  That's a super- [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1575.94s)]
*  This is like an addiction, and I've been through addiction so I'm not judging at all, but it's [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1576.94s)]
*  like I feel really shitty. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1579.94s)]
*  I've got to have a glass of vodka to feel better. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1581.9s)]

*  Here's what I know. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1613.74s)]
*  For a fact, Putin said this for 20 years. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1614.74s)]
*  Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1619.3799999999999s)]
*  They will not accept that anymore that we would accept Chinese missiles in Tijuana, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1622.46s)]

*  You're just not going to accept that. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1631.04s)]
*  NATO is a defensive organization. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1632.2s)]
*  How is it defensive? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1634.3999999999999s)]
*  Because it has never acted proactively aggressively. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1635.3999999999999s)]
*  Where were you when the Yugoslavia war was going on? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1638.0s)]
*  And they were bombing the shit out of Christians in Yugoslavia. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1639.8s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1642.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1643.56s)]
*  That was pretty offensive. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1644.56s)]
*  NATO has always operated in a defensive capacity. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1645.56s)]
*  How would- Really? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1647.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1648.32s)]
*  That's how they created Kosovo? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1649.32s)]
*  Defensively? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1651.32s)]
*  It was defensive. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1652.32s)]
*  Oh, it was? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1653.32s)]

*  NATO has never actually acted unilaterally in Kosovo. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1662.9199999999998s)]
*  It's never attacked anybody without being attacked. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1666.4399999999998s)]
*  It's always been defensive. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1669.3999999999999s)]
*  When? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1670.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay, who in Yugoslavia attacked NATO? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1671.3999999999999s)]
*  Look- Just note, here's the point where you just [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1673.3999999999999s)]
*  submit defeat. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1677.24s)]
*  Bow your head and be like, you know what? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1678.24s)]

*  I'm not saying they were nice good guys. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1686.84s)]
*  I'm just saying that was not a defensive action. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1687.84s)]
*  That was an offensive action. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1689.68s)]
*  Bill Clinton's like, I don't like what you're doing. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1690.68s)]
*  I'm going to use NATO to kill you. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1692.52s)]
*  And he did and then created Kosovo as a NATO base. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1693.52s)]
*  Because they were absolute genocidal maniacs. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1695.76s)]
*  They may have been naughty. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1698.24s)]
*  I'm not defending their- [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1699.24s)]
*  But that's what they were being defended against. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1700.24s)]
*  Who are we defending? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1702.0800000000002s)]
*  The Yugoslavians. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1703.0800000000002s)]

*  By other Yugoslavians? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1706.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1708.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1709.3600000000001s)]
*  Phew. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1710.3600000000001s)]
*  This is getting intense. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1711.8400000000001s)]
*  NATO is a defensive organization. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1712.8400000000001s)]
*  You can say it all you want. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1714.5600000000002s)]
*  Just like you can say Zelensky's a beacon of democracy when he's not elected. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1715.5600000000002s)]
*  And he's banning parts of Christianity. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1719.68s)]
*  But he's a dictator. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1721.72s)]
*  So just to be clear- [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1722.72s)]
*  And it's better just to be honest about what things are. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1723.72s)]
*  Just to be clear, you would have let Putin take what he wants. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1724.8000000000002s)]
*  Because what's the alternative? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1727.76s)]
*  When he invaded Ukraine. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1729.96s)]
*  So I try and deal, especially as I get older, in the world of reality and achievable goals. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1730.96s)]
*  And here's the reality. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1736.48s)]
*  Russia is a nuclear armed power. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1738.44s)]
*  It's the largest country on earth by landmass. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1740.3200000000002s)]
*  It's also the remnants of a global empire. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1743.3200000000002s)]
*  So they have a sense of themselves as a global player. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1745.98s)]
*  And they are because of energy. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1748.28s)]
*  And resources in general. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1750.56s)]
*  Uranium. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1751.72s)]
*  I mean, they have a lot of resources the world needs. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1752.72s)]
*  So they're a real country. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1754.58s)]
*  They're not Afghanistan. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1755.7s)]
*  You can't just tell them what to do. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1757.2s)]
*  Get in line, bitch. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1758.48s)]
*  They're not going to accept that. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1759.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1761.0s)]
*  So they have said since the fall of the Soviet Union, you cannot have NATO on our border [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1762.0s)]
*  because it's a critical national interest of ours. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1766.72s)]
*  So unless you want to risk nuclear war, which we are now doing, you can't move NATO to their [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1769.96s)]
*  border whether you want to or not. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1774.56s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1776.3999999999999s)]
*  If you do, you're going to get a war. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1777.52s)]
*  We've known that since the fall of the Soviet Union. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1778.8000000000002s)]
*  We promised not to do it. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1780.3600000000001s)]
*  And we tried to bring... [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1781.88s)]
*  He asked to be in NATO in 2000. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1783.48s)]
*  He asked George W. Bush to be in NATO. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1785.88s)]
*  Nobody can test that. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1787.24s)]
*  This evil dictator who wants to invade Liechtenstein asked to be in NATO. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1788.72s)]
*  Why wouldn't we let him in NATO? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1792.88s)]
*  Why did Condi Rice say, well, he can't be in NATO? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1794.48s)]
*  Why do we have morons like Condi Rice in our US government? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1797.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1799.2800000000002s)]
*  So when he invaded, though, what would you let him do? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1800.2800000000002s)]
*  We're in a hall of mirrors now. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1803.16s)]
*  Look, really? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1807.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1808.36s)]
*  We're in a very clear moral moment in history where Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1809.36s)]
*  It is a European country. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1814.3999999999999s)]
*  And we side with the dictator and we fund his secret services. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1816.12s)]
*  It has been independent from Russia since the mid-1990s. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1819.12s)]
*  But what do you do? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1820.12s)]
*  Do you let him take it? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1821.12s)]
*  There's nothing moral about this. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1822.12s)]
*  Look, in the real world, we do things we can't achieve. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1823.12s)]
*  And if we can't achieve something, we don't try and do it because millions will die as [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1826.16s)]
*  we're watching. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1829.44s)]
*  So what do you let him do then? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1830.44s)]
*  Well, you start with a realistic understanding of the limits of your power, which is all [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1831.6000000000001s)]
*  adults have to do. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1836.92s)]
*  My neighbors may offend me. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1837.96s)]
*  I want them to turn down the music. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1840.16s)]
*  I can't just go over there and shoot them. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1841.92s)]
*  I just can't. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1843.6000000000001s)]
*  It's against the law and I'll pay a penalty if I do that. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1844.68s)]
*  So I have to negotiate with them. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1846.88s)]
*  Will you please turn down the music? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1848.28s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1849.6000000000001s)]
*  No, please do it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1850.6000000000001s)]
*  If they won't, maybe threaten them. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1851.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, I live in the material real world. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1852.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1855.0800000000002s)]
*  But once actually he's invaded, what do you do? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1856.0800000000002s)]
*  Then you have to decide, like, is it worth it? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1858.2s)]
*  Is it worth it? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1859.8s)]
*  That's interesting to me. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1861.1599999999999s)]
*  A million Ukrainians are going to die. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1862.1599999999999s)]
*  Their farmland is going to be sold to Black Rock. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1863.32s)]
*  The Ukrainian nation will cease to exist. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1864.96s)]
*  They'll flood it with third worlders. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1866.84s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1867.84s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1868.84s)]
*  What would I do? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1870.44s)]
*  I would say, like, if I took over the government in January of 2022 and we're on the verge [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1871.44s)]
*  of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, I would say, guys, it's not worth trying to impose [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1877.08s)]
*  something that this country will never accept because if we try to do that, we'll get a [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1882.36s)]
*  war. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1885.68s)]
*  So do you let Putin take Ukraine? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1886.68s)]
*  You don't let anybody do anything. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1887.76s)]
*  You either do what you want to do because you're gambling with the other people's lives. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1890.64s)]
*  By the way, if a million Brits had died, you might have a different perspective, but it's [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1894.1200000000001s)]
*  very easy to be like, oh, more Ukrainians should die for the cause of democracy. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1898.4s)]
*  Let me assure you, if Russia invaded Britain, that would not be the view of the British [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1902.68s)]
*  people. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1907.48s)]
*  Our view would be to fight to the last man and woman to kick him out. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1908.48s)]
*  But my question really is- [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1911.88s)]
*  You really think so? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1912.88s)]
*  My question is not- [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1913.88s)]
*  They just got invaded over the last 40 years and did nothing. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1914.88s)]
*  So I don't think so. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1916.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't think you would do that. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1917.6000000000001s)]
*  We can't fight back because we have nuclear weapons, but no real military. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1919.48s)]
*  So we'd like to negotiate, just like all conquered nations do. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1922.36s)]
*  They negotiate on the basis of reality. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1925.12s)]
*  What can I actually achieve? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1927.08s)]
*  But respectfully, you're not answering my question, which you don't have to because [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1928.08s)]
*  you're interviewing me in this bit. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1931.04s)]
*  But the question is, once Putin invaded, do you let him take the whole country? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1932.36s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1936.24s)]
*  If I were in charge then? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1937.24s)]
*  If I had come in in January of 2022, I would say to the State Department, I would say to [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1938.3999999999999s)]
*  the NATO leadership- [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1943.7199999999998s)]
*  No, I'm talking about end of February, early March. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1944.7199999999998s)]
*  To that point, I'm cleaning up a mess caused by the previous administration. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1948.16s)]
*  So assume it's happened. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1950.72s)]
*  Let's say I'm Donald Trump, who's actually coming in in that exact circumstance. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1951.72s)]
*  And he's now wrestling with this very problem. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1954.68s)]
*  He certainly is. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1956.52s)]
*  Because he doesn't want to give Putin the win. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1957.52s)]
*  And that's my point to you. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1959.48s)]
*  Do you actually want him to win? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1960.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, if your lodestar is whether other people win, you will lose. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1962.2s)]
*  Okay, that's a shitty way to go through life. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1969.0s)]
*  If I'm trying to prevent you a win- no, I'm trying to win. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1971.0s)]
*  I'm trying to win for my wife, my children, my neighborhood, my country. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1974.6799999999998s)]
*  Once he's invaded- [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1978.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't care whether you win or not. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1979.4399999999998s)]
*  Once he's invaded, what do you do? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1980.4399999999998s)]
*  Your victory has nothing to do with anything. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1981.9199999999998s)]
*  What I care about is my victory. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1983.9599999999998s)]
*  You're in this as much as we are. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1984.9599999999998s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1985.9599999999998s)]
*  I care about my country and whether we win. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1986.9599999999998s)]
*  What's good for us? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1988.4399999999998s)]
*  Because I'm in charge of my country. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1989.4399999999998s)]
*  This is the erratic. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1990.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm in charge of nothing. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1991.4399999999998s)]
*  Is it good for America that Putin wins? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1992.4399999999998s)]
*  This whole thing has been a disaster. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1993.9599999999998s)]
*  We're going to lose the US dollar over this, okay? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1994.9599999999998s)]
*  Because we follow the advice of people like Boris Johnson, who have no skin in the game [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=1997.84s)]
*  whatsoever, but they get to feel like a moral charge, be like, we're on the side of democracy. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2003.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2008.2s)]
*  It's so inferior to make it- I'm sorry to be so mean to the Brits because it's our fault. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2009.2s)]
*  We can take it. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2014.16s)]
*  In fact, we started this, but you guys went along like little Pekingese. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2015.16s)]
*  You shouldn't have done that. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2018.3600000000001s)]
*  But why are you not answering my question? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2019.3600000000001s)]
*  What would I do if I were Trump right now? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2021.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2022.3200000000002s)]
*  Once he invaded Putin, what do you let him take? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2023.3200000000002s)]
*  I'd call Putin, let him take. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2024.92s)]
*  I would say- [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2026.5600000000002s)]
*  Yes, let him take. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2027.5600000000002s)]
*  At that point, to what extent can you clean it up? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2028.5600000000002s)]
*  You call Putin and you say, all right, this happened. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2030.04s)]
*  The first thing we're going to do is recognize it's not in our interest, your interest, the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2032.88s)]
*  world's interest to have NATO missiles on your border. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2036.5200000000002s)]
*  We don't want that. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2038.8400000000001s)]
*  There's no reason to want that because we don't want to drive you into the arms of China. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2039.8400000000001s)]
*  You are really part of Europe and you should be part of the West because the West is Christian [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2043.0s)]
*  world that has a lot in common culturally, religiously, linguistically, historically, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2049.32s)]
*  and we want to be a block against the rising East, obviously. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2055.7200000000003s)]
*  And he says, actually, I want Ukraine. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2058.8s)]
*  If you're the leader of the United States, your number one goal is to keep Russia, the [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2063.5600000000004s)]
*  world's largest landmass with some of the world's deepest energy reserves from aligning [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2067.48s)]
*  with China, which has too many people, not enough land and not enough energy. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2070.88s)]
*  So if they get together, they create a block that is bigger than you economically and militarily. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2074.6800000000003s)]
*  So you cannot let that happen. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2078.6800000000003s)]
*  That's number one goal. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2080.32s)]
*  You cannot let that happen. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2081.32s)]
*  And that retard in charge of our country just allowed that to happen because he hates the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2082.9s)]
*  United States as it acted against its interests consistently from day one, 2020 to January [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2087.44s)]
*  20th, 2025 when he left. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2092.64s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2094.96s)]
*  So that's the goal. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2095.96s)]
*  Do not allow, to the extent you can control it, do not allow Russia to align meaningfully [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2097.44s)]
*  with China. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2102.2000000000003s)]

*  You guys don't want to admit that, but they are. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2105.66s)]

*  What I care about is the balance of power in the world. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2115.2799999999997s)]
*  And if the West finds itself in a place where it's got a much smaller collective economy [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2117.96s)]
*  and a much less powerful collective military than the East, then we're in serious trouble. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2123.08s)]
*  There's no balance in the world. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2130.88s)]
*  The Chinese are in charge of everything. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2131.88s)]
*  And so you can't let that happen. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2134.4s)]
*  But if you roll over and you let Putin take what he wants from... [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2135.68s)]
*  Roll over? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2138.96s)]
*  It's all this like dick measuring contest that's so dumb. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2139.96s)]
*  Let me just respond. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2140.96s)]
*  Roll over? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2141.96s)]
*  Let me just respond. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2143.68s)]
*  If you roll over and you let him take what he wants in Ukraine, why should China not [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2144.68s)]
*  go and take what they want in Taiwan, for example? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2147.28s)]
*  They would just take... [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2149.48s)]
*  Well, they are going to take what they want in Taiwan. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2150.48s)]
*  I'm not sure they will, especially with Trump as president. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2151.48s)]
*  It's part of China. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2154.08s)]
*  I don't think they will. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2155.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2156.08s)]
*  Why do we get to dictate what China does with Taiwan? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2157.08s)]
*  Like, there's spheres of influence. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2159.2s)]
*  You'd be happy for them to take back Taiwan? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2160.2s)]
*  Of course I'm not happy. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2161.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not happy with any conflict ever. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2162.92s)]
*  I hate violence. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2164.48s)]
*  I'm a Christian. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2165.48s)]
*  I'm just saying that great countries have spheres of influence. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2166.48s)]
*  So Saudi Arabia, where we are now, everyone's like, oh, the Saudis are interfering in Yemen. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2169.64s)]
*  Yemen's right there. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2174.52s)]
*  It's in their world. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2175.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, they have an absolute interest in making sure that nothing crazy goes on in Yemen. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2176.7599999999998s)]
*  We have the same interest in Mexico and in Canada. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2181.68s)]
*  And we have some crazy cross-dressing prime minister in Canada, so we kick them out because [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2183.52s)]
*  they're on our border. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2187.72s)]
*  That's what great powers do. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2189.2799999999997s)]
*  That's what they've always done. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2190.8399999999997s)]
*  That's what they always will do. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2191.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's totally fair for us to recognize that the countries around Russia... [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2192.8399999999997s)]
*  They shouldn't be invading or torturing them or oppressing them, of course. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2196.64s)]
*  But that's their sphere. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2199.96s)]
*  And big picture, holy smokes, you do not want the two largest powers in the world, apart [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2201.88s)]
*  from the United States, to get together and align against us. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2208.32s)]
*  Why do you support Israel against Hamas, for example? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2210.7599999999998s)]
*  Why do you support America giving them billions of dollars? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2214.36s)]
*  Well, I don't. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2217.44s)]
*  You don't support Israel being supported by America? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2219.04s)]
*  I support Israel in the sense that I really like Israel. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2221.48s)]
*  I brought my family on vacation to Israel. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2224.36s)]
*  Would you agree with America supplying them with a lot of arms? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2225.6s)]
*  To the extent that it helps the United States, I'm for it, of course. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2229.2s)]
*  I think what we need is... [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2234.2799999999997s)]
*  So you do believe in America interfering in countries a long way away. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2235.2799999999997s)]
*  It just depends which country. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2239.2799999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2241.12s)]
*  Your principle, it doesn't really apply in Israel. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2242.12s)]
*  I'll articulate it for the third time, just to be totally clear. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2244.68s)]
*  I believe the United States, like every country, should, to the extent that it can, act on [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2247.72s)]
*  behalf of its own people and their perceived interests. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2252.3199999999997s)]
*  We can debate what those interests are. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2255.14s)]
*  But that doesn't apply in Israel. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2256.14s)]
*  I don't know what you mean. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2257.14s)]
*  America is supporting Israel because it's an ally. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2259.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't even know what those words mean. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2262.9s)]
*  I'm just saying my principle is... [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2264.22s)]
*  They're an ally, right? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2265.22s)]
*  I mean, they both... [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2266.22s)]
*  I don't know what that means to be an ally. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2267.22s)]
*  I mean, we have no... [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2268.22s)]
*  It means that when Israel wants to attack in Gaza and attack Hamas, America will help [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2269.22s)]
*  it because it's its ally. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2274.18s)]
*  That's not what it means to be an ally. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2275.18s)]
*  So it gives you billions of dollars worth of... [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2276.18s)]
*  That's not what it means to be an ally, okay? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2277.18s)]
*  Well, it fundamentally does. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2278.18s)]
*  I have no greater allies than my own children. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2279.18s)]
*  When they come to me and say, I want to do this, I assess whether it's good for them [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2281.7s)]
*  or not. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2284.22s)]
*  If I don't think it is, I don't support it. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2285.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2286.22s)]
*  Because they're my true allies. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2287.22s)]
*  They're my children. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2288.22s)]
*  But why would you support America getting involved in Israel? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2289.22s)]
*  Just because it's a country that your ally says, I want to do this, does not mean axiomatically [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2290.22s)]
*  you support it. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2292.98s)]
*  Maybe it's not good for you or me. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2293.98s)]
*  So do you support America supporting Israel to the tune of billions of dollars? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2294.98s)]
*  It depends. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2298.8199999999997s)]
*  If you can make... [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2299.8199999999997s)]
*  It depends. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2300.8199999999997s)]
*  What's in America's interest? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2301.8199999999997s)]
*  It depends in all cases. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2302.8199999999997s)]
*  It's not just about Israel. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2303.8199999999997s)]
*  But do you support what's happening then in the support in the attacks in Gaza, for example? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2304.8199999999997s)]
*  Because I don't see the difference between that and what's happening in Ukraine. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2309.3799999999997s)]
*  This is a long way away from America. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2313.5s)]
*  There's no direct involvement with America. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2315.2200000000003s)]
*  There's no mainland involvement with America. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2317.06s)]
*  And yet you think it's right that America supports Israel. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2319.94s)]
*  Put words in your mouth. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2322.86s)]
*  But you don't think it's right that America... [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2324.3s)]
*  I don't think those are the words that came out of my mouth. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2325.7400000000002s)]
*  You don't think it's right America supports Ukraine when Russia invades it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2327.26s)]
*  I have a simple solution. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2329.94s)]
*  Let me explain what I think. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2330.94s)]
*  And then that way we'll get... [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2331.94s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2332.94s)]
*  We'll get right to what I think. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2333.94s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2334.94s)]
*  I actually tuned out midway through. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2335.94s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what you said. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2336.94s)]
*  You can't tune out what I'm right. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2337.94s)]
*  I did. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2338.94s)]
*  I did. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2339.94s)]
*  I did. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2340.94s)]
*  Just because I'm right. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2341.94s)]
*  No, it was more a lecture about what I think and then I'm like, wait, I know what I think. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2343.54s)]
*  I think I'm the world's expert on what I think. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2346.62s)]
*  I was suggesting... [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2347.62s)]
*  In fact, I think I'm the uncontested premier of my own head. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2348.62s)]
*  That is true. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2353.06s)]
*  So I'm going to unload its contents on you right now. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2354.06s)]
*  Explain what is America's national interest in Israel. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2357.2200000000003s)]
*  I'll define the parameters as well because I'm happier with that. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2361.66s)]
*  I would say I support the right of all sovereign nations to act within what they believe is [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2367.7s)]
*  their own interest. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2373.3399999999997s)]
*  We don't always know our own interest in our personal lives or between nations. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2374.3399999999997s)]
*  We think it's good for us, but it may not be. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2377.38s)]
*  The vodka in the morning analogy. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2379.42s)]
*  Not good actually, but I thought it was. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2381.06s)]
*  Now I know it's not. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2382.3399999999997s)]
*  But to the extent that we think we know, I think countries should act on behalf of their [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2383.62s)]
*  own citizens. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2387.54s)]
*  That's the basic idea in democracy. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2388.54s)]
*  And there's certainly... [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2392.1s)]
*  You could make a case that whatever we're giving to Israel this year in the form of [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2394.22s)]
*  direct aid, military assistance, loan guarantees, however we're doing it, is good for the United [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2397.74s)]
*  States. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2402.4599999999996s)]
*  I think you should have to make that case. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2403.4599999999996s)]
*  Why is it good for the United States? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2404.4599999999996s)]
*  You could make that case. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2407.06s)]
*  But why is it? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2408.06s)]
*  I'm not convinced. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2409.06s)]
*  What is the case? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2410.06s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2411.06s)]
*  You'd have to be an advocate for it. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2412.06s)]
*  You are a vociferous advocate for it. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2413.06s)]
*  So why don't you tell me? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2414.7799999999997s)]
*  For what? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2415.7799999999997s)]
*  For USAID to Israel in the current conflict. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2416.7799999999997s)]
*  Actually, I haven't expressed a view about that at all. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2419.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm just curious about the difference in your mind. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2422.1s)]
*  You're not an Israel hater, are you? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2424.7s)]
*  Why do you hate Israel? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2425.7s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2426.7s)]
*  Why are you attacking Israel? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2427.7s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2428.7s)]
*  What problem do you have with Israel, Piers? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2429.7s)]
*  I have no problem with Israel. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2432.7s)]
*  The prince are like this. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2433.7s)]
*  They secretly hate Israel. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2434.7s)]
*  I have no problem with Israel whatsoever. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2435.7s)]
*  It feels like you do. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2436.7s)]
*  Isn't that an Iowa dictator? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2437.7s)]
*  Actually, I don't like that in the eye. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2438.7s)]
*  I think you should... [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2440.94s)]
*  So you hate Israel. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2441.94s)]
*  I think you should go. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2442.94s)]
*  But that's why... [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2443.94s)]
*  Let me just ask you one more time. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2444.94s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2445.94s)]
*  Now we're getting into... [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2446.94s)]
*  I'm not comfortable with this. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2447.94s)]
*  Here's my question. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2448.94s)]
*  Should I be platforming you? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2449.94s)]
*  That's my question. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2450.94s)]
*  You just said you don't like Netanyahu. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2452.86s)]
*  I'm trying to work out whose brand suffers more when we platform each other. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2453.86s)]
*  But let me ask you this. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2456.18s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2457.18s)]
*  I'm going to need a second. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2458.18s)]
*  One more time. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2459.18s)]
*  Just quietly for the people at the back. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2460.18s)]
*  You don't like America getting involved in helping Ukraine against Russia because there's [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2462.1s)]
*  no national interest for America in doing that in your eyes. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2466.82s)]
*  Well, there's a negative national interest. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2470.34s)]
*  A profound one. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2471.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2472.34s)]
*  So I get that. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2473.34s)]
*  We're losing the US dollar as the world's reserve currency because of this war. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2474.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2475.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2476.98s)]
*  So fine. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2477.98s)]
*  So that's your position is America first. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2478.98s)]
*  There's no interest for America. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2480.02s)]
*  Shouldn't be doing it. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2481.54s)]
*  Every country should act in its own interest. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2482.54s)]
*  It's a problem between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2483.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2486.06s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2487.06s)]
*  A lot of people have that view. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2488.06s)]
*  I respect it. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2489.06s)]
*  What I can't understand is the difference in your logic and principle about supporting [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2490.06s)]
*  Israel in its war with Hamas, which is many thousands of miles away from America. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2495.14s)]
*  There's no direct... [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2500.94s)]
*  Have I been a great advocate for the war? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2501.94s)]
*  The war it goes? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2502.94s)]
*  I missed that part of the conversation. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2503.94s)]
*  Well, you support America supporting Israel. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2505.38s)]
*  You don't support America supporting Ukraine. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2507.98s)]
*  I don't support America supporting any nation on the planet to its own detriment. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2510.18s)]
*  Every element of our foreign policy should serve the United States. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2515.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2519.02s)]
*  That's the point of our government is to serve the people who live there called citizens. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2520.02s)]
*  That's what democracy is. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2523.86s)]
*  There's no other reason. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2524.98s)]
*  So if I'm in charge of a country and I decide, actually, I should do this because people [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2525.98s)]
*  who pay me want me to do it or I'm making money to do it, then I'm by definition illegitimate. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2529.22s)]
*  That's not democracy. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2533.14s)]
*  That is a species of oligarchy or whatever. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2534.7799999999997s)]
*  You can assign a name to it. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2536.9s)]
*  That's not democracy. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2537.9s)]
*  We just believe in our system and our leaders should act on behalf of their own people or [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2538.9s)]
*  what they think is their own people's interests. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2542.7000000000003s)]
*  And I would apply that to Israel. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2544.86s)]
*  I'd apply it to Ukraine. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2545.86s)]
*  I think there have certainly been times where we have benefited from our alliance with Israel. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2547.38s)]
*  You know, it's an alliance, just like we have an alliance with the United States. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2553.9s)]
*  They are allies then. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2556.54s)]
*  I don't know what ally means. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2557.54s)]
*  It's short for alliance. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2559.06s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2560.06s)]
*  It is. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2561.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2562.06s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2563.06s)]
*  I never knew that. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2564.06s)]
*  I've got you. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2565.06s)]
*  You got me. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2566.06s)]
*  You've literally just... [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2567.06s)]
*  Come to etymology. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2568.22s)]
*  You are the unchallenged king. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2569.22s)]
*  Boom. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2571.22s)]
*  You're blowing my mind, Piers Morgan. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2572.22s)]
*  My English linguist. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2574.46s)]
*  I was about to say, you guys invented the language. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2575.46s)]
*  You know what? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2577.1s)]
*  It is our language. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2578.1s)]
*  You lot fucked it up. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2579.1s)]
*  We actually... [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2580.1s)]
*  It's our language. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2581.1s)]
*  As a P.G. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2582.1s)]
*  Woodhouse fan, I totally agree. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2583.1s)]
*  It's a root, not a root. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2584.1s)]
*  It's Iran, not Iran. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2586.1s)]
*  And it's a hurricane, not a hurricane. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2588.42s)]
*  Hurricane is embarrassing. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2590.82s)]

*  You don't have hurricanes. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2593.82s)]
*  You changed them. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2594.82s)]
*  We have hurricanes. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2595.82s)]
*  You don't have hurricanes or picants? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2596.82s)]
*  I've been knocked down all the trees in my house. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2598.5800000000004s)]
*  You had a hurricane? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2599.5800000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2600.5800000000004s)]
*  87. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2601.5800000000004s)]

*  Famously, the BBC weatherman at the time announced on the BBC main news on the night, there were [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2603.5800000000004s)]
*  people ringing in saying, is there going to be a hurricane in the UK? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2609.1000000000004s)]

*  And let me tell you, there is not. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2613.5800000000004s)]
*  Four hours later, every tree in south of England fell down. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2615.54s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2617.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2618.86s)]
*  Well, we called it a hurricane, is my point. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2619.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2621.86s)]
*  Well, you don't have enough experience. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2622.86s)]
*  As someone who spends a lot of time in Florida, it's a hurricane. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2623.86s)]
*  It's also a cocktail. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2626.1800000000003s)]
*  Of all the New Year's resolutions you're likely to put off, the one you're most likely to [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2627.54s)]
*  put off and keep putting off is buying life insurance. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2631.58s)]
*  And you should have life insurance. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2634.4199999999996s)]
*  It's kind of crazy not to because the future is unknown. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2635.7799999999997s)]
*  You've got to have life insurance. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2639.02s)]

*  off. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2646.18s)]

*  Everyone is... [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2933.6s)]
*  Well, it's literally theoretical. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2934.6s)]
*  I don't agree with the use of nuclear weapons. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2935.64s)]
*  Nobody disputes the fact that it brought an end to a war which, had it been allowed to [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2937.56s)]
*  carry on for another six months to a year, would have carried many... [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2940.44s)]
*  Why Nagasaki? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2943.04s)]
*  ...killed many more people? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2944.04s)]
*  Why drop it on Japan's Christian population? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2945.04s)]
*  Is there some reason Hiroshima wasn't enough? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2946.52s)]
*  No, because they wanted to test a different variety of atomic weapon. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2948.2799999999997s)]
*  So, like, I'm against that. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2952.2s)]
*  I'm against killing civilians. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2953.52s)]
*  I'm against firebombing cities. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2955.48s)]
*  I'm against bio weapons. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2956.88s)]
*  I'm against chemical weapons. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2958.24s)]
*  What weapons do you support? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2959.24s)]
*  I guess conventional weapons. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2960.24s)]
*  You know, I'm... [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2962.92s)]
*  Well, how big a bomb do you support? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2963.92s)]
*  Look, if you're intentionally killing civilians... [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2965.64s)]
*  Isn't it a question of just of scale? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2967.6s)]
*  I mean... [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2969.2s)]
*  To some extent it is, yeah. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2970.2s)]
*  If you believe in a big bomb and it kills 500 people but you don't agree with one that [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2971.2s)]
*  kills 1,000, what's the difference ideologically? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2974.68s)]
*  It depends who they are. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2977.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think you can say... [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2978.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, there are... [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2979.2799999999997s)]
*  So after Pearl Harbor, you think it was wrong with the Japanese refusing to surrender, vowing [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2980.2799999999997s)]
*  to kill as many people as they possibly could... [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2986.04s)]
*  That America decided to use its two most powerful weapons to bring an end to the war. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2988.2s)]
*  Well, that's one way to put it. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2992.0s)]
*  I would say it's more morally justified what America did than what the British did, for [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2994.16s)]
*  example, in carpet bombing Dresden, actually. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=2998.7999999999997s)]
*  I think there was more justification because they were trying to bring an end to the war [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3000.92s)]
*  as quickly as they could to avoid potentially millions more people dying. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3005.44s)]
*  You know, it's no defense of Imperial Japan or Pearl Harbor or Franklin Roosevelt for [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3010.12s)]
*  allowing Pearl Harbor, which he did. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3014.52s)]
*  It's not a defense of any of that to say if you're intentionally killing civilians, you [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3016.7999999999997s)]
*  probably shouldn't beat your chest and brag about it. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3022.68s)]
*  You know, maybe you can make... [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3024.8799999999997s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3025.8799999999997s)]
*  Maybe you make the case that we had to do it or whatever, but you should... [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3026.8799999999997s)]
*  I agree. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3029.16s)]
*  You should weep, and that's evil, and you should just say it's evil. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3030.16s)]
*  And I know it's really threatening to... [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3033.0s)]
*  Is it evil? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3034.8399999999997s)]
*  Ben Shapiro to say that or whatever. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3035.8399999999997s)]
*  Is it evil? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3036.8399999999997s)]
*  To kill civilians on purpose? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3037.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3038.8399999999997s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3039.8399999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3040.8399999999997s)]
*  Kids and children? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3041.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, how is it not, actually? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3042.8399999999997s)]
*  In a war? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3043.8399999999997s)]
*  We can call it whatever you want. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3044.8399999999997s)]
*  How is it right to kill women and children? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3045.8399999999997s)]
*  I didn't say... [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3046.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, because I think there is a moral right behind you if you are literally... [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3047.8399999999997s)]
*  To kill women and children? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3050.44s)]
*  If there's a world war that threatens the entire world? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3051.64s)]
*  How will you want? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3053.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3054.84s)]
*  Some people killed your kids like your eight-year-old? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3055.84s)]
*  How is that morally justifiable? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3057.84s)]
*  Because actually you have to... [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3060.84s)]
*  Well, by your criteria... [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3062.28s)]
*  That is disgusting. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3063.28s)]
*  Okay, so no war is morally justified? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3064.28s)]
*  I mean, I think it's pretty hard to justify... [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3066.28s)]
*  Any war? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3069.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I'm sure. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3070.2400000000002s)]
*  A pure defensive action, sure. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3071.2400000000002s)]
*  But all I'm saying, look, it's all ugly, it's all hard to stomach. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3073.36s)]
*  I've actually seen some of it up close. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3076.68s)]
*  It's super ugly. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3078.2400000000002s)]
*  You can say you hate it. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3079.2400000000002s)]
*  Let me... [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3080.2400000000002s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3082.04s)]
*  Let me just say... [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3083.04s)]
*  To intentionally kill non-combatants, women and children, I think we can say that's wrong. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3084.04s)]
*  In fact, I thought that was the thing we were fighting against. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3090.08s)]
*  And censorship and dictatorship, people ruling without being elected, people using force [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3093.4399999999996s)]
*  to get their will. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3099.04s)]
*  Like, I thought that was the whole thing we were fighting against. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3100.04s)]
*  So how about we don't become that? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3102.4399999999996s)]
*  And I'm just saying all kinds of decisions are made under duress. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3104.2s)]
*  I have made decisions under duress, foolishly, that I'm ashamed of, including supporting [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3106.68s)]
*  the Iraq war. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3110.34s)]
*  But why are we defending it? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3111.34s)]
*  I just don't understand that. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3112.7400000000002s)]
*  And we're defending it, of course, because we're still doing it. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3113.7400000000002s)]
*  And a lot of people are getting rich. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3116.46s)]
*  And a lot of people find meaning in their otherwise barren lives. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3118.06s)]
*  Rather than raising decent children, having a productive life, making something, they [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3120.2200000000003s)]
*  exist to destroy. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3124.38s)]
*  I just think that's evil. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3125.46s)]
*  You think no military action is morally justifiable, though? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3126.46s)]
*  I didn't say that. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3129.42s)]
*  Are you implying that? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3130.42s)]
*  I'm not implying it. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3131.42s)]
*  I never imply anything. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3132.42s)]
*  I just say things. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3133.42s)]
*  It's the deaths of any innocent people. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3134.42s)]
*  Implying things is for girls. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3135.42s)]
*  I'm just telling you what I think. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3136.42s)]
*  If you kill any innocent people, civilians, in a war, you think it's all morally lacking [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3137.5s)]
*  in justification? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3143.26s)]
*  Because I would argue against that. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3144.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3146.38s)]
*  You're arguing against a construct that you created in order to argue against. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3147.38s)]
*  I'm being super straightforward. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3150.1800000000003s)]
*  If you're in- [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3152.38s)]
*  Is there any form of warfare that's morally justified? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3153.38s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3156.1s)]
*  I'm saying when you intentionally kill women and children, when you wage war through fear [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3158.06s)]
*  by murdering the civilian population, I don't think that's a good thing. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3164.38s)]
*  And I don't think you should be defending it. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3169.62s)]
*  And I don't know why it's such a threat to say that out loud. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3171.1400000000003s)]
*  If you're firebombing someone's city as we did Tokyo, as you guys did Dresden, and a [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3173.78s)]
*  lot of other cities, by the way, in both of those countries, if you're dropping atomic [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3177.78s)]
*  weapons in the middle of town on a Catholic church, I don't know why you have to look [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3181.2200000000003s)]
*  back 80 years later and be like, that was a great thing. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3185.26s)]

*  It was a shameful thing. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3188.1800000000003s)]
*  And we should be better than that because we're not savages. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3189.1800000000003s)]
*  Because we're Christians. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3190.82s)]
*  I don't agree with you. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3191.82s)]
*  I don't agree with you. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3192.82s)]
*  Well, you don't. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3194.26s)]
*  You said, right, Gamert's okay to kill eight-year-olds because it's war. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3195.26s)]
*  Well, it's not okay to kill eight-year-olds. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3197.7400000000002s)]

*  What I said is morally justified. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3200.7400000000002s)]
*  Because when you have an enemy that is prepared to put six million Jews into gas chambers [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3202.9s)]

*  And then any response you give to me is morally justified. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3214.6200000000003s)]
*  Any response? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3217.9s)]
*  Well, pretty much. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3218.9s)]
*  If you're taking the war to them to try and end the war and trying to defeat a million [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3219.9s)]

*  A nihilistic group? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3226.94s)]
*  Says the guy who's defending the murder of eight-year-olds. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3227.94s)]
*  They're nihilistic. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3229.46s)]
*  I'm not defending the murder of any eight-year-olds. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3230.46s)]
*  What you're doing is expressing a species of nihilism. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3231.46s)]
*  The whole point is we are better than you because we have limits. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3233.86s)]
*  There's some things where I'm not going to rape your wife. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3236.86s)]
*  I'm just not. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3237.86s)]
*  How do you stop? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3238.86s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3239.86s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3240.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3241.86s)]
*  I am not going to behave like an animal. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3242.86s)]
*  You are. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3243.86s)]
*  That's why we're at war. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3244.86s)]

*  I get it. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3253.34s)]

*  Not punish, defend. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3255.34s)]
*  Well, first of all, defending. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3256.34s)]
*  There was no threat of invasion. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3257.94s)]
*  If you're the United States, I mean, you live in a tiny island nation. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3259.38s)]
*  I think there was a real threat. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3261.74s)]
*  Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3262.74s)]
*  That is a form of invasion, isn't it? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3264.1s)]
*  It was not an invasion. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3266.1s)]
*  It was an attack on our fleet. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3268.94s)]
*  It's a mass attack on America. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3269.94s)]
*  I'm not defending Pearl Harbor. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3270.94s)]
*  I don't think Roosevelt should have let it happen, which he did. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3272.66s)]
*  But once it happened, what do you do? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3274.82s)]
*  You attack them back. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3276.74s)]
*  I get it. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3277.74s)]
*  So you agree. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3278.74s)]
*  Okay, but hold on. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3279.74s)]
*  There are finer distinctions here. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3280.74s)]
*  Not really. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3281.74s)]
*  Let me finish my fucking sentence. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3283.4199999999996s)]
*  Was it morally defensible to attack them back? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3284.62s)]
*  Stop, stop, stop. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3287.4199999999996s)]
*  Yes, it was morally defensible to attack them back. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3288.4199999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3290.4199999999996s)]

*  But it depends what attack means. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3293.4199999999996s)]
*  You agree with me. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3294.4199999999996s)]

*  This is like crazy. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3299.4199999999996s)]

*  You say it's okay to molest children. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3301.4199999999996s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3302.4199999999996s)]
*  You're like, I didn't say that. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3303.4199999999996s)]
*  No, you just said it's okay to molest children. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3304.4199999999996s)]
*  Why would you be in favor of child molestation? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3306.58s)]
*  Nobody's talked about molesting children. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3308.02s)]
*  You just said it was morally justified for America to molest. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3310.9s)]
*  It's like hilarious. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3313.9s)]
*  America, you said America attacking after Polham. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3314.9s)]
*  I bet when you have dumped people on, they end the interview and they're like, what just [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3317.9s)]
*  happened? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3320.26s)]

*  He just told me what I believed and then he attacked me for believing it. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3322.26s)]
*  It's so hilarious. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3326.7000000000003s)]
*  I love that. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3327.7000000000003s)]
*  It's like a species of masturbation. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3329.06s)]
*  You don't need another person present. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3330.5s)]
*  Don't mock masturbation. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3332.78s)]
*  It's making love to someone you love. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3333.78s)]
*  Okay, let me just say you don't ever want to wind up in a place where you're defending [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3337.58s)]
*  the killing of children. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3341.54s)]
*  You just don't. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3342.54s)]
*  Now you go into any kind of... [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3343.54s)]
*  That wasn't what I was doing. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3345.14s)]
*  I was saying it was moral justifying. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3346.14s)]
*  That's very much what you were doing. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3347.14s)]
*  No, no. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3348.14s)]
*  You said it was morally justified to kill children. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3349.14s)]

*  It's not. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3351.14s)]
*  No, no. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3352.14s)]
*  Morally justified to drop bombs which end a war. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3353.14s)]
*  Yes, I do believe that. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3355.2999999999997s)]
*  Can I ask you just since we're still on Hiroshima Nagasaki. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3356.2999999999997s)]
*  Hard to say you make the case for Nagasaki, but whatever. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3361.62s)]
*  Why not if you have this fantastic new weapon and you want to prevent somehow you're required [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3364.42s)]
*  to invade Japan. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3369.94s)]
*  I don't know why we'd be required to invade Japan, by the way. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3370.94s)]
*  No one ever answers that question. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3374.2200000000003s)]
*  They just attacked you? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3375.2200000000003s)]
*  No, they attacked us four years earlier and we've now beaten them and driven them out [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3376.2200000000003s)]
*  of the Philippines and Malaysia and all this stuff. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3379.3s)]
*  We've won. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3381.1s)]
*  Why do we have to invade mainland Japan? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3382.1s)]
*  No one ever answers that question. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3384.02s)]
*  We just kind of have to because we have to. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3385.14s)]
*  Okay, I'm not second guessing the military leadership of the Second World War, but I [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3386.54s)]
*  am second guessing this. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3389.1800000000003s)]
*  Why wouldn't you bomb just military installations? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3391.04s)]
*  Why drop these bombs in the middle of a city when you know that overwhelmingly the incinerated [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3393.34s)]
*  people will be civilians? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3399.58s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3401.42s)]
*  I would not do that. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3402.42s)]
*  I would say, I have the bomb, okay, we're going to drop it on critical military infrastructure, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3403.42s)]
*  arms manufacturing plants, on a fleet. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3408.38s)]
*  Why would you drop it? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3413.1000000000004s)]
*  Because when the enemy is not making that calculation, you have to stop them. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3414.1000000000004s)]
*  Stop them from what? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3417.7400000000002s)]
*  Not being invaded? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3418.7400000000002s)]
*  Stop them from killing your civilians, killing your people. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3420.06s)]
*  Japan in the summer of 1945 was in no position to kill any American civilians, period. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3423.14s)]
*  So I think they floated a couple of firebombs over Oregon three years before. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3431.1s)]
*  But the point is, look, I understand people do their best under pressure. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3434.46s)]
*  They make mistakes. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3439.3399999999997s)]
*  I've made a million of them. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3440.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm not judging even Harry Truman, who I do think was kind of a pig, but whatever. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3441.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm not even judging. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3444.9s)]
*  Maybe we would have done the same thing. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3445.9s)]
*  I'm just saying 80 years later, why defend that? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3447.7799999999997s)]
*  What's the point? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3450.7s)]
*  I think it was morally justified. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3451.74s)]
*  To kill 200,000 civilians? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3453.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3454.8999999999996s)]
*  So then we wouldn't have to invade, which we didn't have to anyway? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3455.8999999999996s)]
*  To save potentially millions of lives being killed, yes. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3459.06s)]
*  Of our invaders, of their country? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3462.3799999999997s)]
*  Of both sides, to bring an end to the war. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3464.1s)]
*  How about just not invade them? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3465.8999999999996s)]
*  They wouldn't surrender. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3467.06s)]
*  You've got to bring the war to an end. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3468.06s)]
*  But they had lost. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3469.5s)]
*  Why do you have to invade them? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3470.5s)]
*  They refused to surrender. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3472.06s)]
*  Okay, but we'd kick them out of all of their colonies. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3473.46s)]
*  We'd driven them back to their islands. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3476.98s)]
*  You don't dispute dropping those bombs at the end of the war, do you? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3478.18s)]
*  Well, I am disputing it. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3481.46s)]
*  That's what I'm doing right now. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3482.66s)]
*  But you did end the war. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3483.66s)]
*  Oh, disputing that it ended the war? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3484.66s)]
*  Sure, of course. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3486.26s)]
*  So the means and the fate were correct. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3487.26s)]
*  I'm also not disputing that bringing down the Twin Towers changed the United States. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3489.86s)]
*  If you commit enough killing, you will change people's behavior, including getting them [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3493.14s)]
*  to surrender. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3497.58s)]
*  My only question is, is it worth it? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3498.58s)]
*  And what are you becoming when you participate in it? [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3500.14s)]
*  I think that's a meaningful question that nobody addresses. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3501.98s)]
*  Who am I? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3504.38s)]
*  I'm a decent person. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3505.38s)]
*  I'm an imperfect person. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3508.5s)]
*  This is how Americans, I think, should think of themselves and mostly do. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3509.62s)]
*  But I'm also representative of an enlightened country, product of an enlightened civilization [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3512.94s)]
*  called Western civilization. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3518.14s)]
*  And there are certain things I will not do, even if they benefit me. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3520.02s)]
*  I'm not doing that because I'm not that guy. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3523.22s)]
*  I don't kill children. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3525.1s)]
*  I don't rape women. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3526.1s)]
*  I don't send women into battle to defend me, which I guess we now do. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3527.1s)]
*  That's wrong. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3531.54s)]
*  So you would condemn what Israel's done in Gaza, for example? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3532.66s)]
*  I don't want to be involved in it. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3536.62s)]
*  You have only 20,000 children who are said to have died. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3537.62s)]
*  I don't think that that is a... [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3540.62s)]
*  Your criteria, is it morally justified? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3546.8199999999997s)]
*  That is a calculation that Israel has to make. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3549.9s)]
*  I don't want to have anything to do with that. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3551.7799999999997s)]
*  You have no view? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3553.66s)]
*  It's hard to take a lecture from someone who just admitted that he hates Israel in every [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3558.2599999999998s)]
*  fiber of his body. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3561.96s)]
*  I never said that. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3562.96s)]
*  You said that. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3563.96s)]
*  Now you're distracting. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3564.96s)]
*  No, no. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3565.96s)]
*  I don't know who said that. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3566.96s)]
*  You're now distracting. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3567.96s)]
*  You said, I hate Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3568.96s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3569.96s)]
*  I said, I don't think you should be a leader anymore. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3570.96s)]
*  You hate him. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3571.96s)]
*  You shouldn't be a leader. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3572.96s)]
*  With an irrational hatred that, you know, I don't know where it comes from. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3573.96s)]
*  I can't account for what's in your soul. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3577.28s)]
*  I don't have an x-ray into what's deep inside you. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3578.64s)]
*  But all you said was, I hate him. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3581.76s)]
*  I have no problem saying that I think Israel's response has gone way too far. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3582.76s)]
*  Way too many civilians have been killed. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3586.84s)]
*  What I'm surprised about is that you, having lectured me about the deaths of eight-year-olds, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3588.32s)]
*  you don't want to morally condemn what Israel's done in Gaza. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3592.76s)]
*  I'm curious as to why. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3595.68s)]
*  Are your criteria? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3597.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3598.3999999999996s)]
*  My criteria apply solely, and this is a thread of consistency throughout my arguments here [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3599.3999999999996s)]
*  and everywhere for the last 20 years. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3605.2799999999997s)]
*  They have to with the behavior of the United States, which is my country. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3608.72s)]
*  And it's been my family's country for hundreds of years. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3611.16s)]
*  I pay my full taxes. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3613.54s)]
*  I feel very vested. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3614.74s)]
*  I'm a shareholder in my country. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3615.74s)]
*  So its behavior matters greatly to me. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3617.06s)]
*  I'm implicated in its behavior. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3618.7999999999997s)]
*  And I don't want the United States to participate in things that are counter to its interests [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3620.6s)]
*  or counter to the values of Western civilization. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3625.6000000000004s)]
*  That's really simple. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3627.44s)]
*  So other countries do all kinds of abominable things, including cannibalism, a lot actually, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3628.7200000000003s)]
*  and human sacrifice, a lot actually. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3634.84s)]
*  And you know, okay, they're not my country. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3637.76s)]
*  So I don't want the United States involved in anything that's morally indefensible or [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3640.84s)]
*  counter to its own interests. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3645.32s)]
*  Period. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3647.0800000000004s)]
*  So Israel's dropping American bombs on Gaza, killing lots of children. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3648.0800000000004s)]
*  In order to do it, I'll tell you what I think. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3651.7200000000003s)]
*  Hang on. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3654.48s)]
*  You think the killing of civilians is morally indefensible? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3655.48s)]
*  Let me tell you what I think. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3660.88s)]
*  So American bombs are being used to kill a lot of children and women in Gaza. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3661.88s)]
*  I hate that. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3665.96s)]
*  Is it morally indefensible? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3667.2400000000002s)]
*  Now you don't want to say? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3670.56s)]
*  I'm in the process of telling you. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3672.56s)]
*  Go on then. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3674.44s)]
*  Stand back. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3675.44s)]
*  Let the flower bloom. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3676.52s)]
*  Okay? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3677.52s)]
*  Stop tending the garden, Pierce. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3678.52s)]
*  I hate the fact that civilians are killed with American weapons. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3681.24s)]
*  I hate it. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3685.12s)]
*  I hate it in Ukraine. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3686.68s)]
*  I hate it in Gaza. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3687.7999999999997s)]
*  I hate it in the occupied territories, whatever we're calling them these days. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3689.08s)]
*  I think in the specific case of Israel, we have been closely allied with the Israeli [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3693.2s)]
*  government since the 1950s. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3698.68s)]
*  We're actually instrumental in the creation of Israel, so since the late 40s. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3703.4399999999996s)]
*  And I think that there are times when our interests have aligned and there are times [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3707.86s)]
*  the transfer of military technology to China being one of them, where those interests diverge. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3711.1s)]
*  I would very much appreciate an environment in the United States where Americans could [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3716.06s)]
*  speak openly about what their money is doing in a bunch of different foreign countries, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3719.46s)]
*  including that one. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3722.9s)]
*  And I think that we should reassess all our relationships, all our alliances with our [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3724.6200000000003s)]
*  allies on the basis of whether or not it's good for the United States on a bunch of different [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3729.5s)]
*  levels, economically, whether it's good for internal politics, whether it's good for our [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3734.02s)]
*  power abroad, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3738.4199999999996s)]
*  And yes, more than, I really think that we need a much more honest conversation about [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3740.22s)]
*  our relationship with Israel. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3746.9399999999996s)]
*  And I feel, if I can just say one thing and brag, I feel like I'm one of the only people [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3749.62s)]
*  in the United States who's not emotional on the topic. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3755.18s)]
*  Everyone's so emotional about it. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3757.1s)]
*  They hate Israel. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3758.7s)]
*  They love Israel. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3759.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like, I'm American, okay? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3760.7799999999997s)]
*  I like Israel. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3763.42s)]
*  I don't love any country other than my own. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3764.42s)]
*  And I think we should have a rational conversation about this. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3767.34s)]
*  And at this point, as you well know, we don't. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3769.38s)]
*  So that's my actual position. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3772.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3773.54s)]
*  Look, for what it's worth, my position is Israel had a fundamental duty, almost a right [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3774.54s)]
*  but a duty to defend its people after October the 7th, given the horrendous scale of that [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3778.9s)]
*  attack. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3782.94s)]
*  And my only question I kept asking repeatedly from about the first couple of weeks onwards [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3783.94s)]
*  was what is a proportionate response? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3788.7000000000003s)]
*  What is morally justified? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3791.78s)]
*  In general, your relationships with your neighbors are your problem in my home. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3792.82s)]
*  My neighbors, I own my house. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3798.6200000000003s)]
*  I can't leave easily. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3800.6600000000003s)]
*  But it's also an American problem because American military is being used. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3801.6600000000003s)]
*  You make calculations about your behavior based on what you can achieve, based on what [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3805.6200000000003s)]
*  you think your interests are. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3810.82s)]
*  And that's true at the homeowner level and it's true at the nation level. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3811.9s)]
*  So you deal with your neighbors and that's your problem. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3814.9s)]
*  And if you're in a fight with your neighbors, it's up to you to resolve it. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3817.6600000000003s)]
*  It's not my problem. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3820.34s)]
*  I do not have to resolve your disputes with your neighbors. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3821.46s)]
*  And that is true of Ukraine and it's true of Israel. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3824.62s)]
*  I'm sorry, I wish you well. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3828.02s)]
*  I may have, you know, obviously I like Israel because I like going there. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3829.38s)]
*  I know Israelis and I really like them. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3832.06s)]
*  I like Israel. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3833.34s)]
*  Oh, it's the best. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3834.34s)]
*  I mean, to visit, it's the best. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3835.34s)]
*  I like Israeli people. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3836.34s)]
*  I do too. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3837.34s)]
*  I like Palestinian people too. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3838.34s)]
*  I do too and there are a lot of Christians. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3840.54s)]
*  The one thing, I'll just be honest, since you're pushing me on this, that makes me a [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3841.9s)]
*  little bit emotional is there are a lot of Christians, Christian Arabs. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3845.7000000000003s)]
*  And having traveled a lot, I can say just as a matter of personal preference, I really [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3850.02s)]
*  like them. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3852.66s)]
*  I've never met a Christian Arab that I didn't like actually. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3853.66s)]
*  I think they're really amazing people. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3854.86s)]
*  And a lot of them have been killed or mistreated with American money and weapons. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3856.86s)]
*  And I think it's disgusting. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3860.42s)]
*  And I think it's especially disgusting that Christian leaders in the United States have [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3862.42s)]
*  said nothing because they're bullied and bought off. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3865.42s)]
*  And I think they should feel shame because they've dodged their duty, which is to speak [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3867.78s)]
*  up on behalf of their brothers in Christ. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3872.22s)]
*  And they haven't. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3874.68s)]
*  And there are Christians in Gaza who are killed. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3875.68s)]
*  There are a ton in the West Bank. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3876.68s)]
*  Kill the Pope. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3877.68s)]
*  And by the way, that's the cradle of Christianity. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3878.68s)]
*  Where's the Church of the Nativity? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3880.3799999999997s)]
*  It's in Bethlehem. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3881.3799999999997s)]
*  You know, that's what the Pope calls a church in... [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3882.3799999999997s)]
*  He's absurd. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3885.12s)]
*  I can't. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3886.12s)]
*  Yeah, but he actually calls a Catholic church in Gaza every night to see how they're doing. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3887.12s)]
*  Every night, apparently, he calls. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3891.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the Pope thing. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3892.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not getting involved. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3893.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm not a Catholic. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3894.8799999999997s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3895.8799999999997s)]
*  You're going to have to deal with him. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3896.8799999999997s)]
*  He's your Pope, not mine. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3897.8799999999997s)]
*  So we were at a meeting here at TCN the other day, and I looked around the room and every [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3898.8799999999997s)]
*  other person had a kind of ruddy vitality, pink cheeks, alertness, bright eyes, full [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3903.02s)]
*  mental acuity and a cheerfulness you could almost smell. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3912.74s)]
*  And I asked, why does everyone look so good? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3917.3s)]
*  And part of the answer, of course, is they like what we do for a living. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3920.74s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3923.9s)]
*  We think it's important. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3924.9s)]
*  But another reason everyone looks so good is because they had all had a great night [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3926.5s)]
*  sleep. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3931.98s)]
*  I'm not making this up. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3932.98s)]
*  Almost everybody here uses a new sleep technology from a company called Eat Sleep. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3935.38s)]
*  They sent it to us and everyone here loves it. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3941.86s)]
*  It's called the pod. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3944.64s)]
*  It's a high-tech mattress cover effectively that you add to your existing bed. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3946.18s)]
*  You don't need a new bed or anything like that. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3949.82s)]
*  You just throw this over what you have. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3951.54s)]
*  What it does is adjusts the temperature of your bed, warmer or cooler, depending on what [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3953.74s)]
*  you want. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3959.66s)]
*  And it maintains an ideal sleeping environment all night long. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3960.66s)]
*  So I didn't know this, but as you progress through different phases of sleep, your body's [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3964.58s)]
*  needs change. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3968.4599999999996s)]
*  And Eat Sleep automatically keeps things exactly where they should be in the sweet spot through [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3970.3799999999997s)]
*  the entire night. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3975.8399999999997s)]
*  It's been proven to increase the quality of your sleep, the amount you sleep every night. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3977.74s)]
*  It improves your recovery time from physical exertion, and it may even improve your cognitive [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3983.66s)]
*  performance and enhance your overall health. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3988.3799999999997s)]
*  It seems to be doing that in our office. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3991.46s)]
*  So it learns and adapts to your sleep patterns over time and automatically adjusts the temperatures [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3993.94s)]
*  throughout the night through each phase of sleep. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=3998.2s)]
*  And it does this independently for each sleeper on either side of the bed. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4001.18s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4006.8799999999997s)]
*  So you can sleep well and feel much better and be more effective the next morning as [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4008.28s)]
*  we are here. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4014.1600000000003s)]
*  Try it for yourself. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4015.8s)]
*  Go to ate sleep dot com slash Tucker. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4016.8s)]
*  Use the promo code Tucker to get an extra 350 bucks off the pod for ultra. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4019.76s)]
*  You can try it with zero obligation for a month. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4025.44s)]
*  And if you don't like it, just send it back. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4027.52s)]
*  Again, that's eight sleep dot com slash Tucker. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4029.32s)]
*  Better sleep today and look great in your morning meetings as our guys do. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4032.8s)]
*  No, but in general, I'm speaking about the United States, Protestants, the United States, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4038.52s)]
*  that's the world that I'm from that I understand. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4042.6000000000004s)]
*  They have an obligation to stand up for their brother Christians around the world, and they [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4044.7000000000003s)]
*  don't in this specific case because they're intimidated. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4049.88s)]
*  And I think that's really shameful, and I think they should feel shame for it. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4053.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not a political question. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4055.6400000000003s)]
*  It's not, do you hate Israel? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4056.88s)]
*  It's like, I don't hate Israel. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4058.6400000000003s)]
*  Who murders Christians, defenseless Christians, the religion of peace, the actual religion [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4062.88s)]
*  of peace. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4066.88s)]
*  I'm opposed to that, and we should just say that. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4068.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not controversial. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4070.28s)]
*  It should not be controversial. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4071.28s)]
*  And it just shows how totally afraid and lacking self-confidence Christians are to say like, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4072.28s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm not attacking anybody. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4078.96s)]
*  I'm opposed to that. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4081.4s)]
*  You can't use my money to kill Christians, blow up a church. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4082.6000000000004s)]
*  No. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4085.52s)]
*  Or to storm the church of the Nativity. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4086.52s)]
*  That's my religion. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4088.32s)]
*  No. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4089.32s)]
*  You don't get a dollar if you do that. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4090.32s)]
*  And by the way, we're not giving you any money until you promise to treat Christians as equals. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4091.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4097.68s)]
*  That's how I personally feel, and I think all Christians should feel that way. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4099.18s)]
*  It's not attacking anybody. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4101.96s)]
*  It's just a baseline demand of dignity and respect, and they don't get it. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4102.96s)]
*  I mean, fundamentally- [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4106.6s)]
*  That makes me emotional. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4107.6s)]
*  Yeah, look, fundamentally, we're not a million miles apart, and neither of us like war. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4108.6s)]
*  Nobody who likes war should ever be- [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4113.92s)]
*  One of us likes dictators. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4116.24s)]

*  Great. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4124.12s)]

*  You know what? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4126.12s)]
*  You should have been on Twitter. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4127.12s)]

*  I don't want to send money to dictators. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4148.12s)]
*  Does it bother you that your tax dollars go to a dictator? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4151.12s)]
*  No, because I don't see Zelensky as a dictator in the way that you do. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4153.5199999999995s)]
*  If your prime minister decided not to have another election- [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4157.92s)]
*  Zelensky literally been leader for what, two years? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4160.68s)]
*  Two years, I think, he'd been in charge. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4164.48s)]
*  Putin, what's he into, nearly 30 years now? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4166.12s)]
*  I think Putin has been in 24. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4170.08s)]
*  24? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4172.72s)]
*  I'm not defending Putin. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4173.72s)]
*  I'm just saying, all dictatorship is bad. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4175.52s)]
*  A little dollop of dictatorship is as bad as a mouthful of dictatorship. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4178.320000000001s)]
*  I'm just against dictatorship. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4182.84s)]
*  I'm for democracy. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4184.72s)]
*  Inspiring, passionate, determined, and resolute. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4186.72s)]
*  That's what you called Zelensky. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4193.120000000001s)]
*  Oh, I thought you were talking to me. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4194.120000000001s)]
*  I thought that was your out for me. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4195.120000000001s)]
*  Inspiring, passionate, determined, and resolute. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4198.120000000001s)]
*  Very handsome, though, that's implied. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4203.120000000001s)]
*  I would agree with all of those things. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4204.12s)]
*  He would. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4205.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4206.5199999999995s)]
*  I think the courage, the moral courage he showed on the night that the Russians invaded [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4207.5199999999995s)]
*  when people thought they would sweep through Kiev and almost certainly kill him. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4210.8s)]
*  The fact he immediately went on social media and with people around him, he said, I'm not [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4214.5199999999995s)]
*  leaving, I'm staying here for you. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4219.28s)]
*  That's moral courage of the kind we saw with Trump when he stood there and got back up [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4220.96s)]
*  and went fight, fight, fight. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4225.08s)]
*  When he assassinated his political opponents or when he steals USAID or he allows his generals [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4226.08s)]
*  to sell half the missiles they get from the United States, the Mexican drug cartels and [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4232.36s)]
*  Iran and everyone else in the black market. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4236.48s)]
*  Is that inspiring? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4238.24s)]
*  Well, you're making a lot of allegations against him. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4239.24s)]
*  Those are facts. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4241.719999999999s)]
*  OK, you say they're facts, but other people dispute them. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4242.719999999999s)]
*  Who disputes that they're selling weapons in Ukraine on the black market? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4245.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't think anyone disputes that. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4249.599999999999s)]
*  I'm sure that's happening. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4250.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's happening. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4251.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4252.599999999999s)]
*  Who disputes that Zelensky's murdered his political opponents? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4253.599999999999s)]
*  No one. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4257.12s)]
*  Has he? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4258.12s)]
*  You think he personally has ordered the murders? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4259.12s)]
*  Well, he's in charge of the country. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4261.08s)]
*  He's the dictator. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4262.08s)]
*  You think he has? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4263.08s)]
*  He's the dictator. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4264.08s)]
*  You just said he did. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4265.08s)]
*  Well, I mean, in the same sense that we would say... [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4266.08s)]
*  You wouldn't dispute that Vladimir Putin does that relentlessly, in prisons and tortures [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4267.96s)]
*  and kills his political opponents. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4272.8s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, I think there's a long history of that in the region, poisoning your enemies. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4273.8s)]
*  Putin has done that. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4278.6s)]
*  It seems clear to me. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4279.6s)]
*  I'm not sending him money. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4281.16s)]
*  I'm not calling him passionate, determined, resolute and handsome. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4282.320000000001s)]
*  But you haven't actually... [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4284.96s)]
*  You hate this! [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4285.96s)]
*  I love this! [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4286.96s)]
*  This is so good! [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4287.96s)]
*  I don't hate it. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4288.96s)]
*  It's a really easy question. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4289.96s)]
*  And for some reason, you don't want to answer it. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4290.96s)]
*  What would you... [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4291.96s)]
*  I've answered all questions. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4292.96s)]
*  Let me ask you a really easy question. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4293.96s)]
*  Now that you have been, like me, fired from your cushy mainstream media gig, how much [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4297.44s)]
*  happy are you and why? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4305.24s)]
*  And looking back at the television networks and newspapers, how many newspapers do you [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4308.56s)]
*  work for? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4313.4s)]
*  I ran two of the big ones in the UK. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4314.4s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4316.12s)]
*  But over your whole career, how many did you work for? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4317.12s)]
*  I worked for three. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4318.12s)]
*  Four, four actually. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4319.28s)]
*  Okay, right. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4320.28s)]
*  So you've been at every stage of British media. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4321.28s)]
*  Looking back, how do you feel about them? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4323.36s)]
*  I think I had the best of it really. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4325.4s)]
*  I certainly think in newspaper terms, it was before the internet had really taken hold. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4327.24s)]
*  And so you were the receptacle for news for people. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4331.72s)]
*  There weren't many television networks. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4335.76s)]
*  You didn't really have cable television when I was running the papers. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4338.28s)]
*  So papers had much more influence and much more power because they were bringing the [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4341.92s)]
*  news to people. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4345.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4346.68s)]
*  And they would wake up in the morning and they would read their paper to find out what [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4347.68s)]
*  had happened. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4349.64s)]
*  That doesn't happen anymore. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4350.64s)]
*  People already know what's happened. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4351.64s)]
*  There are millions of news networks all over cable news, there's millions of internet sites [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4352.64s)]
*  you can get the news. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4357.360000000001s)]
*  Everyone knows what's going on. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4358.360000000001s)]
*  So the point and relevance and power and influence of newspapers has dissipated. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4359.4800000000005s)]
*  They can still break big stories and have big influence. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4365.16s)]
*  And if I was running one again, I'd be completely digital by now. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4368.12s)]
*  I'd just abandon print papers altogether. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4371.4400000000005s)]
*  But the economic model is very difficult. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4373.76s)]
*  If you do that, you don't make as much from the digital side as you do from print. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4375.599999999999s)]
*  So they've got to weigh that up and somehow get through it. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4379.12s)]
*  But I would invest heavily in investigative longer term journalism because that's how [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4381.2s)]
*  you can now bring news to people they don't already know. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4385.2s)]
*  Well sure, but I meant all true, totally true. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4388.48s)]
*  But I'm really asking about the honesty level. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4390.759999999999s)]
*  So now you have a gig where you can say whatever you want, you're your own boss, you can make [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4394.599999999999s)]
*  a real living. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4399.4s)]
*  I have no idea how you're doing, but given your numbers are huge. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4400.599999999999s)]
*  So I bet you're probably making more than you made before, in that range anyway. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4404.28s)]
*  So it's all great. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4408.8s)]
*  But the greatest part is you can say exactly what you want. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4409.8s)]
*  How would you compare that to your previous? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4413.44s)]
*  I would say the difference is we can't get cancelled. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4415.16s)]
*  Who's going to cancel? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4418.12s)]
*  It's ourselves. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4419.639999999999s)]
*  So we have a complete freedom and a sort of liberation from the restrictions inevitably [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4420.96s)]
*  come with working for big companies. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4425.719999999999s)]
*  Big companies in the media have really struggled, I think, to move with the way young people [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4428.32s)]
*  now get their information. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4434.16s)]
*  They don't really understand the big legacy media companies, that young people do not [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4436.72s)]
*  watch linear television. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4441.24s)]
*  They don't read print newspapers. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4443.5199999999995s)]
*  What they've really struggled with is to stop lying. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4445.5599999999995s)]
*  They can't stop lying. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4447.4s)]
*  They're like compulsive liars. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4448.4s)]
*  And they have controlled the way news is dominated. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4449.4s)]
*  The thing about you and me and other people that do this, whether you're on the left or [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4453.34s)]
*  the right, there's no control. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4456.88s)]
*  We don't get controlled by anybody. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4458.599999999999s)]
*  We're only answerable to ourselves and what we want to do. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4460.24s)]
*  I think I'm like you in the sense of we're not politically aligned in many ways, but [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4462.68s)]
*  we love talking to each other, love debating, love arguing, love asking questions, love [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4466.76s)]
*  learning. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4471.64s)]
*  I think we are politically aligned. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4472.64s)]
*  I think we are in many ways. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4473.96s)]
*  You do own guns. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4475.240000000001s)]
*  I know that you do. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4476.400000000001s)]
*  I know that you do. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4477.64s)]
*  And I know that you think this whole crazy thing is insane. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4479.0s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4481.400000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4482.400000000001s)]
*  But let me tell you. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4483.400000000001s)]
*  I know that you do. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4484.400000000001s)]
*  I can see it in your eyes. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4485.400000000001s)]
*  How do I get out of this? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4486.400000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of military in my family who know how to use guns better than me. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4487.400000000001s)]
*  I know, but not all use of guns is equal, right? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4491.16s)]
*  Some is counterproductive. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4496.0s)]
*  You know the thing about guns? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4497.0s)]
*  I'll just say this for your audience. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4498.28s)]
*  It will all be looking at me thinking I'm the 2A gun grabber. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4499.88s)]
*  The reality is it's a complete cultural difference. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4503.4s)]
*  In my country, everybody used to have a gun. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4505.36s)]
*  Everybody used to in the old days. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4508.36s)]
*  Now very few people have guns. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4510.12s)]
*  There are incredibly tight restrictions. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4512.16s)]
*  And the consequence of that is we have almost zero gun crime. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4514.28s)]
*  Is your country, is London safe now? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4518.12s)]
*  I'm about to come to that. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4520.8s)]
*  The problem we have is with knights, right? [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4522.280000000001s)]
*  So I'm not saying for a moment you get rid of all the guns, nobody gets killed. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4524.96s)]
*  Of course they do. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4527.6s)]
*  We have a knife crime problem epidemic in our country. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4528.6s)]
*  You have a people problem. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4531.12s)]
*  You have the kind of people who stab each other. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4532.6s)]
*  You didn't used to have that. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4534.8s)]
*  Well, we did. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4536.04s)]
*  We did. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4537.04s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4538.04s)]
*  I mean, it's measurable. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4539.04s)]
*  How many people got stabbed in London in 1970 or shot compared to now? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4540.04s)]
*  Sure, but there are massive increase because the people, the attitudes of the people, the [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4543.04s)]
*  actions of the people are totally different. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4547.8s)]
*  You've got different people and different behaviours. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4549.04s)]
*  And like you can't admit that because I'm not sure why. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4551.48s)]
*  No, no, because actually there are lots of white English people who stab each other. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4553.88s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4558.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4559.24s)]
*  So it's not just about the influx of migrants, if that's what you're saying. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4560.24s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4563.44s)]
*  I'm saying that I do think immigration has changed your country for the much, much worse. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4564.44s)]
*  Well, it certainly changed the country. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4567.96s)]
*  Much worse. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4569.96s)]
*  That's my opinion. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4570.96s)]
*  But it's not just immigrants who are behaving badly at all. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4571.96s)]
*  There are a lot of native born indigenous Brits who are behaving badly. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4573.56s)]
*  That is totally true. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4576.24s)]
*  And there are a lot of immigrants in your country who are kind of superior, actually, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4577.92s)]
*  for being totally honest, who are really impressive. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4581.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4583.92s)]
*  I'm not making a blanket statement. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4584.92s)]
*  I'm just saying that the behaviour has changed of the people who live there, right? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4585.92s)]
*  You can't be trusted with guns now because you're out of control. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4589.26s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4591.28s)]
*  I just know we have very tight gun laws and no gun violence. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4592.28s)]
*  The interest is very little. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4595.56s)]
*  My question for you. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4597.26s)]
*  But do you own a gun secretly? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4598.26s)]
*  I do not, no. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4599.8s)]
*  Do you want to? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4600.8s)]
*  You know why I get five years in prison if I got caught with it? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4601.8s)]
*  So you're afraid of your government which doesn't trust you because it's a dictatorship [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4604.64s)]
*  office. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4608.14s)]
*  Let me ask you a question about guns since you raised him. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4609.14s)]
*  I'm curious. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4610.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4611.6s)]
*  It's said there are over 400 million guns in circulation in America. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4612.6s)]
*  Hope so. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4615.92s)]
*  And it's apparently a million new guns get sold every month. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4616.92s)]
*  So that number exponentially rises. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4619.76s)]
*  The number of mass shootings in America is also rising. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4622.200000000001s)]
*  Do you think anything should be done about that? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4626.860000000001s)]
*  If I had my time again talking about this with Americans, I would never have been so [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4628.92s)]
*  censorious. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4633.12s)]
*  I have been talking about gun control. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4634.599999999999s)]
*  The word control alienates Americans. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4636.5599999999995s)]
*  But what I would have said was how do you make it safer? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4638.04s)]
*  How do you stop so many people getting shot? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4640.88s)]
*  What do you do about it? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4643.72s)]
*  Well you ban SSRIs immediately. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4645.88s)]
*  You ban SSRIs. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4648.04s)]
*  You ban whole categories of psychoactive drugs. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4650.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4653.76s)]
*  Like immediately. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4654.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4655.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4657.400000000001s)]
*  I mean the truth is that drugs and alcohol drive a lot of our social ills. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4658.400000000001s)]
*  A lot of them. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4665.0s)]
*  And when people are sober, and I would say if you're on Xanax or Prozac or whatever, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4666.360000000001s)]
*  you're not sober. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4671.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4672.52s)]
*  I agree. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4673.52s)]
*  But certainly alcohol and meth and you know, most of our social problems are either caused [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4674.52s)]
*  or exacerbated by the drugs that people take. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4679.12s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4682.8s)]
*  And mass shootings are definitely in that category. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4683.92s)]
*  So look, as you found out, your knife crime has just exponentially jumped recently. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4686.0s)]
*  And that's not because there are more knives. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4693.16s)]
*  People use them at dinner every night and have for hundreds of years since the Roman [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4695.6s)]
*  times they've used knives and not stabbed each other. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4698.44s)]
*  It's because people are behaving differently. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4700.4s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4703.0s)]
*  That's true. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4704.0s)]
*  I must say all the gun control people who want to send all the guns to Ukraine so they [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4705.0s)]
*  can go kill other Eastern Europeans, it's like, it's sort of weird. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4707.32s)]
*  Do you think it's weird? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4712.56s)]
*  No, one thing is weird about the question I asked you is simply that if I was an American... [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4713.72s)]
*  There's a lot of gun crime in Ukraine. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4717.6s)]
*  Are you adding to that? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4718.6s)]
*  Well, it's a war. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4719.6s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4720.6s)]
*  It's gun crime. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4721.6s)]
*  I call it gun crime. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4722.6s)]
*  People getting killed with guns. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4723.6s)]
*  You think Ukraine defending itself as a crime? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4724.6s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people getting killed with guns and I think it's really sad [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4726.72s)]
*  and we should disarm Ukraine. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4729.320000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4731.04s)]
*  Well, sure, people getting killed with guns. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4732.04s)]
*  They shouldn't have. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4733.92s)]
*  There should be strict controls on guns in Ukraine. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4734.92s)]
*  The automatic weapons. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4735.92s)]
*  You guys are sending automatic weapons to Ukraine to kill other human beings. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4736.92s)]
*  I just think that... [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4740.64s)]
*  I'm just not comfortable with that morally. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4741.64s)]
*  I see what you're doing, Tucker. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4745.64s)]
*  You're doing the British Cheshire cat thing with me. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4746.64s)]
*  No, because I think it's a fatuous argument, but it's fine. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4749.64s)]
*  Fatuous meaning brilliant? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4754.64s)]
*  You're avoiding answering my question. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4755.64s)]
*  Which is why do we have so many guns? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4758.64s)]
*  Because we're free. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4759.64s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4760.64s)]
*  Because we're free. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4761.64s)]
*  Because no one can tell us we can't defend ourselves. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4762.64s)]
*  We all used to have guns, too. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4763.64s)]
*  Now we don't. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4764.64s)]
*  And then you guys, after the Second World War, which was like a liberation war and you won, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4765.64s)]
*  you lost all your freedom, and now you can't even express your political opinions or they [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4770.5599999999995s)]
*  put you in jail. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4772.6s)]
*  So how did you win? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4774.2s)]
*  How did you win? [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4775.96s)]
*  Is that what victory looks like? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4776.96s)]
*  You lose all your rights, your economy gets destroyed, you get tried by bankers, and all [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4778.24s)]
*  of a sudden, oh, I won. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4782.6s)]
*  We won because I'm not conducting this interview in German, which I wouldn't be. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4783.6s)]
*  So it's a linguistic thing. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4786.44s)]
*  I'd rather not speak German. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4787.44s)]
*  I'd be goose-stepping around my yard in England. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4789.44s)]
*  Goose-stepping? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4792.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4793.24s)]
*  But you are goose-stepping. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4794.24s)]
*  People are arrested for praying. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4795.24s)]
*  We literally won our freedom. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4796.24s)]
*  Where's your freedom? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4797.24s)]
*  You can get arrested. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4798.24s)]
*  I'm as free as you could possibly want a human being to be. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4799.4s)]
*  You can't defend yourself. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4801.96s)]
*  You can't control who comes into your country. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4803.32s)]
*  And you can't criticize government policies or you get arrested. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4805.08s)]
*  So how are you free? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4808.599999999999s)]
*  You're a slave, aren't you? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4809.599999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4811.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4812.0s)]
*  How free are you? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4813.0s)]
*  We have cultural problems in our country. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4814.0s)]
*  Could you go on Facebook right now and say, I don't want any more immigrants in my country. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4815.0s)]
*  They're making it worse. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4818.4s)]
*  You could say that, what you couldn't say, because a lot of these stories, I have to [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4820.08s)]
*  say in America, have been spun completely disingenuously. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4823.48s)]
*  There's one case, for example, I see everyone trying to send me as an example of, Britain's [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4827.6s)]
*  gone mad. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4832.64s)]
*  Elon Musk has done it as a guy who got seven years in prison. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4833.64s)]
*  Actually what he was doing, this guy, was he was orchestrating and directing rioting [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4836.240000000001s)]
*  on hotels containing asylum seekers because he had an incorrect belief that someone who [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4842.64s)]
*  had stabbed three young girls to death and stabbed loads of others in a horrific attack [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4848.400000000001s)]
*  was an illegal asylum seeker. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4853.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't want asylum seekers in his country. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4855.04s)]
*  Fine, fine, fine. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4857.48s)]
*  It's not okay to have no asylum seekers. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4858.48s)]
*  It is not okay to allow too many people to come in. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4860.68s)]
*  Why is it not okay to have no asylum seekers? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4863.04s)]
*  It's not okay to have a broken asylum system as we have. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4864.04s)]
*  Why have any asylum seekers? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4866.32s)]
*  Because I believe you should as a good country. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4867.76s)]
*  Because we're a caring, compassionate country. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4869.56s)]
*  And by the way, Britain, for all your knocking of Britain. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4871.12s)]
*  How is that caring, compassionate? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4873.44s)]
*  Your native population is in massive decline. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4874.48s)]
*  How is that compassionate to your people? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4876.68s)]
*  Britain actually is one of the most tolerant multicultural countries in the world to this [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4878.72s)]
*  day. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4883.44s)]
*  Then why do you have so many stabbings? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4884.44s)]
*  We have a problem with stabbings. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4885.74s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4886.74s)]
*  How many people get killed by stabbings a year in Britain compared to... [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4887.74s)]
*  Evidence to you that you have a problem. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4890.74s)]
*  We're very compassionate. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4892.74s)]
*  We do have a lot of stabbings. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4893.74s)]
*  Fine. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4894.74s)]
*  But by your criteria, they're just defending themselves. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4895.74s)]
*  Haven't they got a right to bear arms? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4897.74s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4898.74s)]
*  Well, hang on. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4899.74s)]
*  Have they? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4900.74s)]
*  Hang on. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4901.74s)]
*  You didn't have like really any stabbings years ago. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4902.74s)]
*  Now you've got a ton of stabbings. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4903.74s)]
*  But everything's totally fine. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4904.74s)]
*  And if you complain about it, you're going to jail. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4905.74s)]
*  Do the British people have a right to bear arms, Tucker? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4907.42s)]
*  All free people have a right to defend themselves. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4910.5s)]
*  Bear arms? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4912.34s)]
*  Of course. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4913.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4914.34s)]
*  So why are you annoyed about the knife crime? [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4915.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm against all crime. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4918.34s)]
*  Look, here's my only point. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4921.34s)]
*  I'm sure if they use the Tucker Carsten argument, well, the other guy's got a knife. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4923.34s)]
*  I better carry one. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4926.34s)]
*  In the United States, which is governed by a system we inherited with great gratitude [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4927.34s)]
*  from you, from the English, a person has a right, which is we believe God given, it's [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4930.34s)]
*  inherent, we're born with it because we're not slaves, we're free people, to say what [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4937.34s)]
*  he thinks is true. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4940.34s)]
*  Period. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4941.34s)]
*  Period. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4942.34s)]
*  So the government has to not only not infringe on that right, but protect it. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4943.34s)]
*  It exists to protect that right. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4946.34s)]
*  Your system is a little different. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4948.34s)]
*  We took it a little farther and enshrined that in our Bill of Rights, which unfortunately [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4949.34s)]
*  you don't have. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4952.34s)]
*  I bet you wish you did. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4953.34s)]
*  But from an American perspective, the idea that you would ever punish someone for talking... [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4954.34s)]
*  But that wasn't why that guy was punished. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4959.34s)]
*  But that may be right. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4961.34s)]
*  I would not contest that. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4963.34s)]
*  It is right. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4964.34s)]
*  He was literally inciting a riot. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4965.34s)]
*  But you would also not contest that there are hundreds of people who've gone to jail [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4966.34s)]
*  in the last five years in the UK for expressing opinions. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4969.34s)]
*  That is a fact. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4971.34s)]
*  It depends what you think that opinion is. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4972.34s)]
*  Most of them have been directing violence or inciting violence. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4974.34s)]
*  That's different. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4977.34s)]
*  I don't think that's right, Piers. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4978.34s)]
*  I don't think they were charged with that. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4979.34s)]
*  That is right. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4981.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4982.34s)]
*  And also look at the case of Tommy Robinson. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4983.34s)]
*  Tommy Robinson, most Americans I speak to think he's in jail as some kind of political [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4985.34s)]
*  prisoner, like Nelson Mandela, for having views about... [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4990.34s)]
*  Or Julian Assange. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4993.34s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not why... [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4994.34s)]
*  Tommy Robinson's in jail because he defamed a young Syrian refugee. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4996.34s)]
*  He defamed? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=4999.34s)]
*  Yeah, he lied about him. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5000.34s)]
*  He did? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5001.34s)]
*  Well, he did. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5002.34s)]
*  But he was then... [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5003.34s)]
*  No, the guy eventually... [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5004.34s)]
*  How many of your leaders have gone to jail for lying? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5005.34s)]
*  What? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5006.34s)]
*  How many of your leaders have gone to jail for lying? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5007.34s)]
*  They lie constantly. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5009.06s)]
*  Every time they speak, they lie. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5010.06s)]
*  Not enough. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5011.06s)]
*  Not enough. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5012.06s)]
*  Right around zero, actually. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5013.06s)]
*  But they throw powerless people in jail for saying things they don't like and saying they're [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5014.06s)]
*  not fine. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5017.74s)]
*  But you also have a defamation law in the United States. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5018.74s)]
*  People have gone to jail for breaking that law. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5019.74s)]
*  That's happened. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5022.02s)]
*  So you're not so pure yourself. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5023.02s)]
*  I don't mean you have criminal... [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5024.02s)]
*  Yes, you do. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5025.02s)]
*  Criminal defamation, you do. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5026.02s)]
*  I'm going to... [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5027.02s)]
*  Go and check it. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5028.02s)]
*  Go and check it. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5029.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5030.02s)]
*  And you've had people go to prison in America for defamation. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5031.700000000001s)]
*  For libeling people. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5035.700000000001s)]
*  For saying things that you don't like. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5036.700000000001s)]
*  It's happened. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5038.42s)]
*  I'm just pausing because I don't know if that's true. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5041.26s)]
*  It is true. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5043.18s)]
*  I think I would be opposed to that. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5044.18s)]
*  It is true. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5045.18s)]
*  Do people go to jail in the United States for defamation? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5046.18s)]
*  Yep. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5047.9800000000005s)]
*  They face civil judgment. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5048.9800000000005s)]
*  They face civil judgment. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5049.9800000000005s)]

*  Your government is saying that some opinions are so inflammatory that they inspire people [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5166.3s)]
*  to commit acts of violence. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5172.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5173.82s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5174.82s)]

*  How do you measure hatred? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5187.42s)]

*  Why don't you overthrow your government? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5199.98s)]

*  I don't agree with the government on that. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5206.7s)]

*  I don't agree with that, right? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5208.7s)]

*  What are you doing to overthrow the tyranny that it's leading to? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5210.7s)]
*  If the excitement of hatred makes people commit acts of violence, and you intend it to, that [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5213.5s)]
*  should be a crime. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5219.38s)]
*  You shouldn't incite people to go and commit acts of violence. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5220.42s)]

*  all self-preservation here. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5226.7s)]

*  If you get up and you say, I hate Vladimir Putin and all Russians, you're not going to [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5233.42s)]
*  go to jail in the UK for that because that's the official policy of your government. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5237.78s)]
*  You wouldn't go to jail in the UK. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5240.34s)]
*  No. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5241.34s)]

*  You asked me earlier if you said you hate immigrants, you wouldn't go to prison for [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5246.22s)]
*  that. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5249.06s)]
*  If you said that they're all over there in that hotel, go and throw firebombs at it, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5250.06s)]
*  that should be a crime, shouldn't it? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5254.02s)]
*  Yeah, if you're telling people to go commit that. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5255.58s)]
*  That's what most of these cases involve. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5257.66s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5259.14s)]
*  That's not what it said. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5260.14s)]

*  So my criteria. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5269.1s)]
*  Okay, but I'm talking about your government and I'm asking why. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5270.1s)]
*  I told you I don't agree with it. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5272.46s)]
*  Well, that's dictatorship from what I can tell. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5274.06s)]
*  I don't, yes. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5276.14s)]
*  How is it not dictatorship? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5277.14s)]
*  The government is saying things that we hate are illegal, but it puts you in prison. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5278.22s)]
*  I'm half agreeing with you. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5281.42s)]
*  Yeah, good. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5282.42s)]
*  Right? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5283.42s)]
*  So what are you doing to change it? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5284.42s)]
*  So you've got a prime minister now. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5285.42s)]
*  I'm on my show regularly saying I think it's wrong. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5286.42s)]
*  But at a certain point, don't people have a right to do what the American colonists [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5288.94s)]
*  did and that's to throw off tyranny because their rights are inherent. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5293.54s)]
*  They're given by God because they're human beings. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5297.299999999999s)]
*  So you want them to be violent? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5298.58s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5300.339999999999s)]
*  I'm totally opposed to violence. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5301.339999999999s)]
*  You're the one who was justifying firebombing stuff. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5302.339999999999s)]
*  Wasn't the example you just gave, wasn't it conducted with violence? [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5303.98s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5306.86s)]
*  But the world should be single-minded in getting a government that permits people to live like [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5308.259999999999s)]
*  human beings, not like slaves. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5314.94s)]
*  I don't think anyone should be able to use on social media, they shouldn't be using rhetoric [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5318.78s)]
*  which is inciting violence, period. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5323.74s)]
*  Hate, I think this idea of what is hate is a much more complex thing. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5326.54s)]
*  I don't feel comfortable with somebody who believes in free speech and people saying [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5331.099999999999s)]
*  hateful things and being put in prison. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5333.98s)]
*  It's wrong. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5335.82s)]
*  It should be happening. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5336.82s)]
*  Yeah, well inciting violence is an absurd standard because, and they've tried to take [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5337.82s)]
*  me out many times with this, some wacko will go shoot innocents and be like, he watched [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5340.82s)]
*  this show or he had the same opinions as you. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5345.179999999999s)]
*  It's like, I couldn't be more against violence. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5347.74s)]
*  I'm mad at my government because it funds violence around the world. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5349.54s)]
*  So inciting violence is just a way to get your critics to shut up. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5353.74s)]
*  You need to loot their country. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5356.46s)]
*  But if I say to people here, can you come and stab Tucker? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5357.94s)]
*  Of course, but that's not inciting, that's like directing. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5361.34s)]
*  It's like being a criminal master. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5364.7s)]
*  I think you'll find, I may be wrong, but I'm rarely wrong in linguistic matters. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5366.0199999999995s)]
*  I think you'll find the definition of inciting and directing is not dissimilar. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5371.139999999999s)]
*  You know as well as I, and I don't know why you would defend it, that your government [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5376.42s)]
*  is stifling criticism of itself, of its own illegitimate leadership, using law enforcement. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5379.9400000000005s)]
*  I think in relation to hate crime, yes, they've overreached on that. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5387.14s)]
*  In relation to using social media. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5392.66s)]
*  But they flooded your country with immigrants. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5394.06s)]
*  We had riots last summer in Batacca. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5395.42s)]
*  And that's very unpopular with the native population. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5396.9400000000005s)]
*  Always has been. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5399.46s)]
*  Always has been. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5400.46s)]
*  And the government for 40 years has told them in increasing volume to shut up and stop complaining. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5401.46s)]
*  And now it's putting them in jail for complaining about it. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5406.34s)]
*  That's the truth. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5408.1s)]
*  That's not as simplistic as that. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5409.1s)]
*  Of course it's not as simplistic as that. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5410.9400000000005s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5412.82s)]
*  I agree. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5413.82s)]
*  I'm overgeneralizing. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5414.82s)]
*  By the way, you wouldn't have a country without a flood of immigrants. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5415.82s)]
*  America wouldn't exist. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5420.38s)]
*  But you're not America. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5421.38s)]
*  You have a native population. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5422.38s)]
*  It's been there since the beginning of time. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5423.38s)]
*  Why would you object to the concept of a flood of immigrants? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5424.38s)]
*  You literally got built on it. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5426.900000000001s)]
*  Well look what happened to your country. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5428.22s)]
*  Everything you made. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5429.22s)]
*  What about your country? [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5430.22s)]
*  Well, but my country is by its nature different. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5431.22s)]
*  On the premise of immigrants. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5434.700000000001s)]
*  You're a monarchy run by the head of your church. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5436.780000000001s)]
*  There's a monarchy here. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5439.18s)]
*  Right and they're living as they should, which is consistent with their values. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5440.900000000001s)]
*  And your country isn't. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5445.660000000001s)]
*  So that's all I'm saying. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5446.660000000001s)]
*  I think I'm on a key. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5447.660000000001s)]
*  Well, I think the King's a fine man. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5448.660000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5452.02s)]
*  My King, yes. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5453.02s)]
*  What has he done to preserve England? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5455.120000000001s)]
*  Preserve England? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5458.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5459.9800000000005s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5460.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5461.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5462.9800000000005s)]
*  He's the head of the Church of England. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5464.94s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5465.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5466.94s)]
*  How's church attendance? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5467.94s)]
*  He goes quite regularly. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5468.94s)]
*  That's all a joke, dude. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5469.94s)]
*  You had a Christian country, now you don't. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5474.139999999999s)]
*  So that's not a win. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5475.98s)]
*  That's a failure. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5476.98s)]
*  We have a far less Christian country. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5477.98s)]
*  I agree. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5479.419999999999s)]
*  I'm sad about that. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5480.419999999999s)]
*  So can I ask you, Keir Starmer seems like the most unpopular, now that Trudeau's gone, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5481.419999999999s)]
*  the most unpopular leader in the West. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5489.339999999999s)]
*  He's certainly gone from winning with a big majority last summer to being incredibly unpopular [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5492.14s)]
*  very quickly. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5496.34s)]
*  Can he hang on? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5499.1s)]
*  You've got four more years of this, ish? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5500.1s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5502.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5503.02s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5504.02s)]
*  I would say that there's a reasonable chance he will contest the next election in four [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5505.02s)]
*  years' time. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5507.3s)]
*  It depends, really, on how the next year goes. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5508.3s)]
*  I mean, I've never seen anyone lose such political capital so quickly. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5510.3s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5515.22s)]
*  And he did it because he came in and decided that the strategy he would do is to say the [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5516.22s)]
*  Tories were so awful that the country's now in a terrible state. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5520.34s)]
*  So bad that we're going to have to do all these punitive taxes and we're going to have [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5524.78s)]
*  to whack the pensioners and we're going to have to whack the farmers and punish all these [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5528.5s)]
*  groups of people. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5533.1s)]
*  And everyone was like, wow, you've waited 14 years in opposition. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5534.1s)]
*  And this is what you're doing? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5538.5s)]
*  What did the farmers do wrong? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5539.5s)]
*  I never understood that. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5540.5s)]
*  They make our food. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5541.92s)]
*  I mean, it's ridiculous. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5543.2s)]
*  Most of them live literally... [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5544.34s)]
*  Because British food's not good? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5545.66s)]
*  Is that the problem? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5546.66s)]
*  Most of them lose money, farmers. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5547.66s)]
*  And the idea... [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5548.98s)]
*  He created the impression that a lot of pensioners can afford it, a lot of farmers can afford [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5549.98s)]
*  it. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5553.26s)]
*  Actually, most of them can't. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5554.26s)]
*  Most of them can't. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5555.26s)]
*  But why would you target farmers? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5556.26s)]
*  I mean, it's just... [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5557.26s)]
*  Inexplicable. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5558.26s)]
*  But it's happened throughout Europe and the United States, attacking farmers. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5559.26s)]
*  And it seems like part of a bigger... [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5562.46s)]
*  It should reward farmers. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5563.46s)]
*  Farmers are the lifeblood of any civilized country. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5565.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5568.38s)]
*  But if you're looking big picture, if you're opposed to famine and you're for human flourishing [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5569.38s)]
*  and people, then you'd want to do whatever you could to have enough food. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5573.98s)]
*  I agree. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5579.179999999999s)]
*  And if country by country by country, Germany, Great Britain, Denmark, Holland, they're all [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5580.179999999999s)]
*  attacking farmers, United States, maybe there's a bigger anti-human agenda at work. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5585.74s)]
*  Does it... [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5591.219999999999s)]
*  Do you see that? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5592.219999999999s)]
*  I just think it's a pretty dumb political agenda that's been pursued so far. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5593.219999999999s)]
*  It's not just dumb, it's weird. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5595.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5596.62s)]
*  Of all the groups you'd attack, why farmers? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5597.62s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5599.379999999999s)]
*  It does make sense, though, doesn't it? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5600.379999999999s)]
*  Why? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5602.459999999999s)]
*  Well, clearly there's an effort to reduce the human population. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5603.54s)]
*  If you're... [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5607.1s)]
*  If all these countries... [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5608.1s)]
*  You think he wants to starve the Brits and kill us? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5609.1s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5611.38s)]
*  I don't... [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5612.38s)]
*  You know, you can't assess the motives of individuals. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5613.38s)]
*  They're unknowable. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5615.58s)]
*  He's not trying to starve the British people. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5616.58s)]
*  Okay. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5617.94s)]
*  I don't know him. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5618.94s)]
*  I don't know what he's trying to do. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5619.94s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5620.94s)]
*  No, you come on. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5621.94s)]
*  Look around the world. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5622.94s)]
*  Government after government after government around the world is endorsing policies that [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5624.78s)]
*  they know will reduce birth rates, is attacking agriculture, and is allowing, I don't know, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5630.64s)]
*  drugs and food that kill people and make them less healthy. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5640.320000000001s)]
*  So if you add that all up, you don't have to know their motives. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5643.76s)]
*  You just look at the effects and you're like, the effect is to kill people. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5646.4800000000005s)]
*  What is going on here? [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5651.6s)]
*  Do you ever wonder that? [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5652.6s)]
*  Crap governance by a serious... [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5654.160000000001s)]
*  But it's consistent around... [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5655.96s)]
*  It's like every country is like, you know, we still people kill themselves. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5657.200000000001s)]
*  How would you ever come up with that? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5660.04s)]
*  At a time when we need more people, not less. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5662.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5664.92s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5665.92s)]
*  Bad governing. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5667.92s)]
*  I mean... [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5668.92s)]
*  But why is it the same in every country? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5669.92s)]
*  Well, I just think the food thing in particular, look how fat everyone's getting. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5670.92s)]
*  Right? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5674.4s)]
*  I mean, fat, lazy, sedentary, and you're like, that can't be good for anyone. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5675.4s)]
*  No, but why is it happening? [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5680.12s)]
*  Bad, bad politicians. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5682.32s)]
*  Why is every politician in every Western country coming to the same set of policies whose effect [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5684.84s)]
*  is fewer children, more unhealthy dead people? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5690.92s)]
*  Like what... [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5694.96s)]
*  I mean, you don't have to be a conspiracy not to just say, I'm looking at just the numbers. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5695.96s)]
*  How many kids per family dropping? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5700.120000000001s)]
*  That is the consequence of all the political actions that have been taken. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5702.400000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5705.88s)]
*  I don't think it's a mad global conspiracy in the way you might be inferring. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5706.88s)]
*  Well, I don't know what I'm inferring. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5710.04s)]
*  I'm just noticing. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5711.04s)]
*  Yeah, but listen, I know where you're coming from on this. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5712.48s)]
*  I don't believe they're actually smart enough to do that from the politicians I've met. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5715.48s)]
*  Then why are they all doing it? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5720.0s)]
*  I think because they're not very competent and they're not very good and they're lazy. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5721.0s)]
*  And they're going along my... [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5725.08s)]
*  But wouldn't the law of averages would suggest that, like, I don't know, the governments [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5726.08s)]
*  of Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, pick another, Mexico, would adopt the opposite policies? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5728.64s)]
*  Like we're going to pay you to have more kids, not one of them. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5736.12s)]
*  Here's what I agree with you about. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5738.04s)]
*  It's wrong and it's got to change. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5739.2s)]
*  We need more people, not less. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5741.64s)]
*  We need better food, not crap food. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5743.38s)]
*  We need to reduce the size of our human beings whilst increasing populations. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5745.56s)]
*  Otherwise the planet's going to kill itself, going to basically self-implode and die out, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5751.400000000001s)]
*  as Elon Musk keeps warning. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5756.52s)]
*  He's right. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5757.76s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5758.76s)]
*  I'm going to end on this. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5759.76s)]
*  Have we ended on a great... [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5760.76s)]
*  I just want to know, since you're, I think, good at predictions, how do you think the [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5761.76s)]
*  war in Ukraine will end? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5767.76s)]
*  I think it will end... [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5770.08s)]
*  I do think Donald Trump will get a deal. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5771.88s)]
*  I do think in the end that Russia will probably keep most of the land they've taken. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5774.12s)]
*  I personally wish that wasn't the case, but I think that's how this gets ended. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5779.32s)]
*  And I hope that Ukraine get enough guarantees that the rest of their country won't get taken [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5783.76s)]
*  down the line. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5788.16s)]
*  We saw Crimea go. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5789.16s)]
*  We've seen the East go, pretty much. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5790.6s)]
*  And I suspect Vladimir Putin, I believe, will try and take the rest of it. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5793.16s)]
*  I may be wrong. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5797.12s)]
*  I hope I'm wrong. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5798.12s)]
*  I hope a deal gets done soon because too many people are dying. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5799.16s)]
*  I heard the other day that 100,000 people on that battlefield died in six weeks on both [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5802.5599999999995s)]
*  sides collectively. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5808.24s)]
*  I mean, this is a horrendous... [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5809.24s)]
*  This has been the stuff you saw at the SOM. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5810.24s)]
*  I mean, it's like... [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5812.24s)]
*  I totally agree. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5813.24s)]
*  But do you think it's kind of... [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5814.24s)]
*  I strongly agree with you, and I have for two and a half years, but why is it only now [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5815.24s)]
*  that we're getting sort of more realistic casualty figures? [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5820.0s)]
*  How could a government fund a war without knowing how many people died in that war? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5824.28s)]
*  You think the Ukrainians have not been telling the truth about it? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5830.28s)]
*  I think the US and British governments have both lied about it and kept those numbers [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5832.5599999999995s)]
*  from the public. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5837.0s)]
*  And I feel like that's a crime. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5838.8s)]
*  They should tell the truth. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5840.92s)]
*  They should be transparent. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5841.92s)]
*  If that's the case, it's wrong. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5842.92s)]
*  I hope you'll go back to Great Britain and grab them by the throat and make them tell [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5845.8s)]
*  the truth. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5848.2s)]
*  You know what? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5849.2s)]
*  You've made me think, go back to Britain and make us... [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5850.2s)]
*  Jolt us into action. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5853.08s)]
*  You know what I like about the Trump thing in the last week? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5854.88s)]
*  Just the sense of hope, optimism, dynamism. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5857.88s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5860.28s)]
*  Even before the election, when he went down to watch one of Elon Musk's rockets launch, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5862.04s)]
*  and just the fact that America's back in the business of going into space, aiming to go [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5867.12s)]
*  to the moon, aiming to go to Mars. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5872.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5874.92s)]
*  Where's that in my country? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5875.92s)]
*  Where is that kind of dynamism? [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5877.68s)]
*  Where is someone hitting the ground with 200 things they want to do? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5879.72s)]
*  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5882.72s)]
*  You may not agree with all of them, but my God, the energy that Trump is expending, the [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5884.360000000001s)]
*  dynamism, the aspiration, the thing of making America great again. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5887.92s)]
*  I've got a feeling this time around Trump's going to have a very good four years. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5893.52s)]
*  I'm not so convinced about my country, and I want to get that kind of oomph and energy [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5897.360000000001s)]
*  and dynamism in Britain, because I don't disagree with a lot of the characterization. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5902.92s)]
*  In fact, if we are a country in the doldrums right now, we are. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5907.12s)]
*  And it solves a lot of problems. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5910.280000000001s)]
*  I think that's really smart. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5911.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5912.320000000001s)]
*  Especially the attitude. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5913.92s)]
*  All of it. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5914.92s)]
*  Why are people doing heroin in the first place? [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5915.92s)]
*  Why would you want to do fentanyl? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5916.92s)]
*  Because you're hopeless. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5917.92s)]
*  We have a terrible drugs problem. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5918.92s)]
*  No, I agree. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5919.92s)]
*  In our country. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5920.92s)]
*  Terrible. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5921.92s)]
*  You have a bad drug problem in America. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5922.92s)]
*  And you solve it with attitude. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5923.92s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5924.92s)]
*  Piers Morgan, thank you for taking all this time. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5925.92s)]
*  I enjoyed it. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5926.92s)]
*  It's great to see you in Saudi Arabia. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5927.92s)]
*  It was still a game show time. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5928.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5929.92s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5930.92s)]
*  That was awesome. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5931.92s)]
*  I enjoyed it. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5932.92s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5935.92s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5939.36s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5941.04s)]
*  On another level, it's shocking. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5942.04s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, all the change taking place in [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5943.48s)]
*  our economy and our politics with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, Google [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5946.84s)]
*  has decided you should have less information rather than more. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5952.12s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5956.0s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5958.4s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5959.76s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5961.08s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5962.72s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5963.72s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5964.72s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAOSY2xIcxc&t=5966.12s)]
