**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo)
*  Thank you! Man, I'm really happy to be here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=0.0s)]
*  I am grateful to be in Fort Worth, Texas. I am. I mean that. And I'm not, I guess no [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=8.0s)]
*  matter where I was I would say I was grateful to be here, but I actually am [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=23.92s)]
*  really grateful to be here. This is our 13th city that we've hit this month and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=26.4s)]
*  you know there comes a point in a month-long jaunts around the country which [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=33.4s)]
*  has just been wonderful and affirming and beautiful in every way, but where [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=37.48s)]
*  you're just sick of staying in hotel rooms and eating room service. It's just, it's not [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=41.64s)]
*  great for you. I have so many family and friends in Texas that this is my, after [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=46.72s)]
*  13 hotel rooms in a row I'm staying in a familiar bed here tonight and I'm with [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=54.64s)]
*  familiar people and I'm just grateful. It's like a spa treatment standing here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=60.4s)]
*  So thank you very much for having me. It's funny, every city, one of the reasons [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=65.12s)]
*  we wanted to do this in the first place was because you get such a distorted [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=72.88s)]
*  sense of what's happening in the country from the media. Well I love you too, thank [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  you. I do and of course there's a lot of time and energy put into convincing you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=82.1s)]
*  that you shouldn't love your fellow Americans, you should hate them and so [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=90.38s)]
*  it's just important to get on the road and see them and you realize that I [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=94.82s)]
*  don't care what they tell you on CNN, the hate level in America is incredibly low. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=98.97999999999999s)]
*  Everyone's nice and they're nice to each other. It's true. That's the main thing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=103.06s)]
*  I've noticed. I mean I don't have a TV but you know I check in from time to time [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=108.66000000000001s)]
*  on the telephone and they're constantly telling America's a powder keg, it's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  about to explode. I don't know where the explosions gonna happen. I haven't been [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=118.58000000000001s)]
*  there yet in 13 cities. Everywhere I've been people are kind to each other. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=123.14s)]
*  They're friendly, they're open, they're hilarious, they're exactly the people I [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=127.94s)]
*  grew up with. They're Americans and they like each other despite the efforts of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=132.9s)]
*  their leaders to tell them they shouldn't. On the other hand there is a lot of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=137.1s)]
*  dark stuff going on, so much dark stuff going on that I thought today I was [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=141.45999999999998s)]
*  trying to be as honest with myself as I can be and of course it is really easy [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  to lie to yourself and most of us enjoy it, I certainly do, but I had to ask [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=150.38s)]
*  myself honestly like how do I feel not just about this election but where we're [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  going you know and where our children will be and what kind of country this [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=159.17999999999998s)]
*  will be not just next year but in 15 years, 20 years, 100 years and I'm being [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=164.73999999999998s)]
*  as sincere as I can be I'm really hopeful. I really am. I may be the only [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  person. I am really hopeful. There are the darkest forces I've ever seen arrayed [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=173.26s)]
*  against pretty much every single person in this room and certainly against [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=181.94s)]
*  everything you believe in your families and they're not gonna win and and let me [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=186.5s)]
*  tell you why I think that and I'm not just talking about this election and by [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=191.82s)]
*  the way if you as I do in hotel rooms and airplanes think of all the things [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=195.74s)]
*  that could go wrong you know not just in this election but in the world all the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=200.18s)]
*  nuclear wars and EMP attacks and weird viruses that Tony Fauci creates in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=205.38s)]
*  Chinese labs and unleashes on the world not that that could ever happen and then [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=209.54s)]
*  you think of the fact that actually that did happen Fauci did do that with your [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=216.06s)]
*  tax dollars and it's still walking through my old dog park in DC with [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=218.86s)]
*  Secret Service protection that we're paying for then you think to yourself [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=221.94000000000003s)]
*  you know that's so I know boo boo boo well exactly but then you think [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=225.66000000000003s)]
*  yourself that's so unfair that's so grotesque in fact the whole point of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  that exercise is to be unfair the whole point of it is to shake your faith in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=236.38000000000002s)]
*  the idea of fairness or justice I mean the whole point of all of this is to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=242.3s)]
*  make you give up on the idea of fairness they literally put an illiterate woman in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=247.82s)]
*  charge of the White House press briefing the whole job is being able to speak and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=253.7s)]
*  she can't talk everything's a malapropism it's insane was that an [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=261.58s)]
*  accident no it was the whole point it was the whole point it's why we have a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=267.62s)]
*  trans admiral the whole point of it is to make you give up on the idea of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=271.74s)]
*  justice and basic fairness which is that the capable hard-working people rise and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  the people who can't speak English don't wind up as the White House spokesman [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  that's the definition of fairness and the whole reason that they staff those [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=287.82s)]
*  jobs in the way they do the whole reason they elevate the incompetent and punish [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=294.86s)]
*  the competent is to make you give up on the idea that there is justice and and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=298.7s)]
*  what I realized today thinking about it is that justice is bigger than the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=303.82s)]
*  Justice Department actually justice is bigger than this country it's bigger than [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=307.7s)]
*  society justice exists separate from all of us we can distort justice all we want [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=313.3s)]
*  but it doesn't change the fact that in the end there is justice there is right [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  and wrong and the fair and good thing happens because good wins in the end [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=323.9s)]
*  that is a fact but that's not the only reason I'm hopeful the second reason I'm [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=328.62s)]
*  hopeful is I'm commanded to be hopeful it's the law every wedding you go to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=335.17999999999995s)]
*  they're always reading one Corinthians 13 it's like I think it's the only verse [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=342.14s)]
*  in the Bible actually but if you actually read it you know love is not the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  only thing mentioned there's faith and then exactly and we're required to have [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=353.02s)]
*  it it's not optional it's not a byproduct of a sunny day I feel hopeful [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=358.7s)]
*  today no hope is what you have on purpose it's intentional things don't [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=362.26s)]
*  seem to be going in the right direction I don't see how we get out of this it's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=368.5s)]
*  like a Scooby-Doo episode oh my gosh we're boxed in but I know we will get [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=372.14s)]
*  out of it actually maybe not in the way we want to but in the end we'll look [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=378.5s)]
*  back and this is true in the life of every single person in this room you [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=384.1s)]
*  will look back on the best moments in your life the moments that changed you [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=388.46s)]
*  that opened your eyes to true beauty that made you a better person that deepened [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=393.5s)]
*  your relationships with the people that you love and you'll notice that those [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=397.62s)]
*  best moments were all the worst moments actually and I'm obviously saying this [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=400.7s)]
*  is someone who gets fired a lot and that's been true every I can't even keep [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=405.26s)]
*  track my wife said to me how many times have you been fired I don't know you know quite a few loved [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=410.46s)]
*  every one of them in fact I've loved them so much I'm so used to this cycle [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=415.02s)]
*  of the worst things being the best things that this last time I fired I was [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=420.02s)]
*  like I'm psyched kind of psyched to be humiliated in public once in a while [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=423.7s)]
*  because I know it'll end well and I know that I will learn something about myself [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=428.14s)]
*  no it's true and so actually we have cause for hope no matter what happens [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=432.58s)]
*  and I bet every single person in this room has a worst-case scenario in mind [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=439.94s)]
*  for what happens in November oh don't get me started baby that's the one heck [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=445.06s)]
*  like it here everybody in this room everybody in this country actually is [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=457.1s)]
*  pretty worried about the future and I'm here to say that we have an obligation [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=464.7s)]
*  to feel hopeful we have grounds to feel hopeful and let me be a little more [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=469.54s)]
*  specific about why I'm hopeful because you're actually on the right side and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=475.26s)]
*  for years I covered politics in Washington where I lived and I really [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=483.82s)]
*  tried to resist adding a moral cast to political differences I mean you you [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=488.7s)]
*  know for arguing over the capital gains tax rate you know and you think it [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=493.7s)]
*  should be 15 and I think it should be 35 maybe you know one of us is right [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=498.14s)]
*  probably me of course but it doesn't mean you're a bad person we just [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=501.29999999999995s)]
*  disagree over a number but that's not all what we're seeing now we're not [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=506.09999999999997s)]
*  seeing disagreements about how to make the country better no one's even [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=510.94s)]
*  pretending that the program that you oppose and I oppose is gonna make the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=515.1s)]
*  country better or people happier no it's a program of death and destruction of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=520.7s)]
*  course and that's become very obvious someone said very wise in my life said [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=525.74s)]
*  to me today we should be grateful for how clear things are now we don't need [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=531.1s)]
*  to lie to ourselves it's super obvious and I'll say for myself I don't always [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=535.5s)]
*  know what's good and I definitely don't always imagine I'm on the right side [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=541.3s)]
*  having been on the wrong side having endorsed the Iraq war like I have a [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=546.1s)]
*  keen sense of my own absurdity and there was in fact a mirror outside the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=549.22s)]
*  bathroom in my hotel today when I walked out of the shower so I was like oh yeah [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=553.7s)]
*  I am absurd I recommend that to every middle-aged man by the way especially [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=557.46s)]
*  those who think they're successful you really do have this image of yourself as [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=562.62s)]
*  a godlike figure you know kind of master of your fate leader of your family leader [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=568.7s)]
*  of men then you come out of the shower into the glare of the mirror and you're [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=574.38s)]
*  like there's just like lumpy primate in front of you with hair in the wrong [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=578.38s)]
*  places and you're like is that really the godlike leader of men I don't think [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=581.18s)]
*  so that's an absurd person who is that get the hell out of my bathroom and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=584.74s)]

*  So amazing [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2201.2000000000003s)]
*  I just want your top line conclusion about what we're watching here [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2203.96s)]
*  So we've had tens of millions of people come into our country [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2209.96s)]
*  and if you watch the media and change the country forever [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2212.96s)]
*  totally destroyed huge parts of the country [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2216.96s)]
*  that's true, I've just seen it [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2218.96s)]
*  and those who live here know what I'm talking about [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2220.96s)]
*  but the way that it's explained to us [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2222.96s)]
*  is that you have people from around the world showing up [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2225.96s)]
*  looking for better opportunities [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2228.96s)]
*  which I'm sure is true on some level [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2230.96s)]
*  but it sounds like you found a business [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2233.7200000000003s)]
*  run by [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2235.7200000000003s)]
*  devil worshipping drug gangs [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2237.7200000000003s)]
*  yeah, in short [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2239.7200000000003s)]
*  it's like that old adage [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2241.7200000000003s)]
*  follow the money [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2243.7200000000003s)]
*  what I discovered is that everyone is making money off this [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2245.7200000000003s)]
*  and I think we kind of already know that [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2247.7200000000003s)]
*  but it was shocking, I mean [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2249.7200000000003s)]
*  so shocking, everybody is being paid off [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2251.7200000000003s)]
*  the federal government is giving [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2253.7200000000003s)]
*  billions of trillion dollars [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2255.7200000000003s)]
*  from Health and Human Services [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2257.7200000000003s)]
*  to fund places here in Texas that I snuck into [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2259.7200000000003s)]
*  secret child encampments [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2262.48s)]
*  here in the state of Texas [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2264.48s)]
*  to house half a million [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2266.48s)]
*  unaccompanied children [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2268.48s)]
*  and everybody is talking about [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2270.48s)]
*  how they're making all this money [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2272.48s)]
*  that's what it came down to, that's what I saw [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2274.48s)]
*  even the cartel said we got to get paid [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2276.48s)]
*  you got to let us finish [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2278.48s)]
*  we're cutting this steel beam [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2280.48s)]
*  we put audio recording devices on the beams [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2282.48s)]
*  to listen as they traffic people across [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2284.48s)]
*  so this is an opportunity [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2286.48s)]
*  for you to actually see it [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2288.48s)]
*  a lot of documentaries talk about it [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2291.2400000000002s)]
*  people think about it, they know [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2293.2400000000002s)]
*  but you actually are immersed in it [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2295.2400000000002s)]
*  and it is so shocking [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2297.2400000000002s)]
*  I was actually [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2299.2400000000002s)]
*  there's a scene where I'm visibly [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2301.2400000000002s)]
*  blackpilled [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2303.2400000000002s)]
*  because the board of legislators, they watch it [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2305.2400000000002s)]
*  and they just shrug their shoulders [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2307.2400000000002s)]
*  and they say we can't do anything about it [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2309.2400000000002s)]
*  you know when you feel for them [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2311.2400000000002s)]
*  I know a lot of them, I think they're decent people [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2313.2400000000002s)]
*  there isn't anything they can do [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2315.2400000000002s)]
*  because the politicians [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2317.2400000000002s)]
*  are refusing to do anything about this [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2319.24s)]
*  and the reason I'm so excited about this film [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2321.24s)]
*  is because [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2323.24s)]
*  the people who are supposed to be representing us [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2325.24s)]
*  especially in this state [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2327.24s)]
*  like what does Dan Crenshaw say to this? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2329.24s)]
*  like honestly, why isn't anyone stopping this? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2331.24s)]
*  no, because they can't deny it when they see this [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2335.24s)]
*  I have a positive thing to say [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2339.24s)]
*  and there's a man in this film [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2341.24s)]
*  I'll give you his first name, his name is Zach [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2343.24s)]
*  and he's watching it right now [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2345.24s)]
*  and he's the border patrol agent in this film [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2347.24s)]
*  who decided to blow the whistle [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2349.24s)]
*  on the Department of Homeland Security [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2351.24s)]
*  and [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2353.24s)]
*  and [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2355.24s)]
*  he's giving an interview [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2357.24s)]
*  in his vehicle [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2359.24s)]
*  in his uniform [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2361.24s)]
*  he's a hero [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2363.24s)]
*  and you contrast all the feckless, morally weak people [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2365.24s)]
*  in this country [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2367.24s)]
*  who are not willing to take a stand with the ones who are [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2369.24s)]
*  and I found out Tucker [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2371.24s)]
*  that just two days ago [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2373.24s)]
*  I gave a peace and desist letter to him [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2375.24s)]
*  for appearing in this film [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2377.24s)]
*  and as a result of that [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2379.24s)]
*  I got wind over the last 24 hours [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2381.24s)]
*  that five more border patrol agents [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2383.24s)]
*  are going to blow the whistle [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2385.24s)]
*  as a result of this film [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2387.24s)]
*  and [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2389.24s)]
*  one more thing [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2391.24s)]
*  and [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2393.24s)]
*  so naturally [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2395.24s)]
*  the investigative reporter [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2397.24s)]
*  this guy is actually on the Canadian border [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2399.24s)]
*  I didn't even realize the Canadian border was overrun [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2401.24s)]
*  you're in Maine [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2403.24s)]
*  I was in Vermont [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2405.24s)]
*  so I go up there this weekend to get comment [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2407.24s)]
*  like I do [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2409.24s)]
*  and the state police detain me [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2411.24s)]
*  for trying to ask questions [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2413.24s)]
*  of the border patrol agents [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2415.24s)]
*  so [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2417.24s)]
*  this is a giant system [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2419.24s)]
*  and I mark my words [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2421.24s)]
*  I promise you [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2423.24s)]
*  there are going to be dozens of federal whistleblowers [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2425.24s)]
*  coming forward in the next few weeks [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2427.24s)]
*  and the question [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2429.24s)]
*  and the question for you is [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2431.24s)]
*  are you going to have their backs? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2433.24s)]
*  so all of us have a long mental list [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2435.24s)]
*  all the things that you should be doing [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2437.24s)]
*  but you keep putting off folding your laundry [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2439.24s)]
*  going to the gym [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2441.24s)]
*  stop eating Oreos [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2443.24s)]
*  doing the dishes, etc, etc, etc [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2445.24s)]
*  shopping for life insurance [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2447.24s)]
*  probably shouldn't be on that list [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2449.24s)]
*  but it is for a lot of people [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2451.24s)]
*  because it's hard [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2453.24s)]
*  and it takes a lot of time [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2455.24s)]
*  but all of a sudden it's not hard [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2457.24s)]
*  and it doesn't take much time at all [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2459.24s)]
*  and we give the thanks to Policy Genius [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2461.24s)]
*  it's made it fast and simple [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2463.24s)]
*  so we're living in a world that's getting [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2465.24s)]
*  much more complicated by the day [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2467.24s)]
*  and planning ahead [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2469.24s)]

*  if something were to happen to you [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2473.24s)]
*  makes a lot of sense [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2475.24s)]
*  suddenly it's obvious to people [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2477.24s)]
*  I should probably have life insurance [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2479.24s)]
*  why not? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2481.24s)]
*  well why not? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2483.24s)]
*  you want to make sure the people who depend on you are provided for [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2485.24s)]
*  you want them to inherit your debts [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2487.24s)]
*  for example [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2489.24s)]

*  and say it's one of the [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2601.24s)]
*  great upsides to working in the media [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2603.24s)]
*  the downside of working in the media [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2605.24s)]
*  is you have to work with other people in the media [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2607.24s)]
*  it's like a daily prostate exam [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2609.24s)]
*  but [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2611.24s)]
*  it is [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2613.24s)]
*  it is, I mean that [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2615.24s)]
*  but the upside is [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2617.24s)]
*  you get to meet [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2619.24s)]
*  amazing people [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2621.24s)]
*  and most famous people [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2623.24s)]
*  I'm just you know spoiler alert are actually not worth knowing [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2625.24s)]
*  at all [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2627.24s)]
*  but occasionally you run into someone [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2629.24s)]
*  who's famous and in spite of [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2631.24s)]
*  being famous is genuinely [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2633.24s)]
*  interesting and really smart [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2635.24s)]
*  and free thinking [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2637.24s)]
*  and if you'd asked me five years ago [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2639.24s)]
*  would Roseanne Barr, one of the most famous people in the world [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=2641.24s)]

*  I mean it's just such an insult everything that they do is to insult and humiliate us [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3136.24s)]
*  the women first of all they can't insult or humiliate us enough [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3142.24s)]
*  by telling us that if you got a penis you're a better woman that really pisses me off you know [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3146.24s)]
*  I mean it is [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3156.24s)]
*  it makes me so mad you know it just makes it's mockery of you actually [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3158.24s)]
*  it's mockery and humiliation it's black face it's woman face [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3163.24s)]
*  so when when the little bud light dude is telling you how hard it is to be a woman [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3170.24s)]
*  which he's been for like a week [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3175.24s)]
*  I mean you know what was disgusting about that [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3180.24s)]
*  we're going to get into it and you were getting into it but you know I've been involved in this [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3183.24s)]
*  fight for a really long time [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3188.24s)]
*  and and he wasn't just being a woman or a girl or any of that stuff [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3190.24s)]
*  he was dressing up like an eight-year-old [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3198.24s)]
*  right you saw it right I was irate [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3202.24s)]
*  and then he would run in his bedroom with his teddy bears and stuff in that little girl's dress [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3206.24s)]
*  I mean it was just pedophilia it was normalizing pedophilia [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3211.24s)]
*  and that is all they care about that and killing babies that's only two things they care about [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3216.24s)]
*  normalizing pedophilia and killing babies [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3223.24s)]
*  it's hard to argue with that I mean if those clearly are their priorities I mean [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3228.24s)]
*  but both the thing that both have in common is the destruction of innocence [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3233.24s)]
*  absolutely that's where they that's where the devil gets his power [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3238.24s)]
*  tell me what you mean [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3242.24s)]
*  well you know the destruction of everything decent good and innocent [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3246.24s)]
*  he loves nothing more than when we you know people give him the power by destroying it [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3255.24s)]
*  then he owns them he owns the people who do that in his name and you know they worship Satan [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3263.24s)]
*  and I mean people are always going oh Roseanne you're so crazy [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3272.24s)]
*  but they do they worship Satan just like we worship God only I think they're more [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3276.24s)]
*  whatever the word is devout than we are [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3287.24s)]
*  they're way more devout than we are they never go a day without [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3291.24s)]
*  worshiping at the altar of the devil and doing his bidding [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3297.24s)]
*  we'll forget about God when we you know we go and we only turn to God when you know we're having troubles or something [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3302.24s)]
*  or when we feel bad but those guys are at it 24-7 [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3310.24s)]
*  and that is what that's when you ask me what's going on in the world [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3314.24s)]
*  that is exactly what I think is going on in the world it's a big old war [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3318.24s)]
*  it's a war between good and evil and you know you've got two choices who you're going to serve [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3323.24s)]
*  like that Bob Dylan song you're going to serve somebody [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3331.24s)]
*  it may be the devil or it may be the Lord but you're going to have to serve somebody [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3335.24s)]
*  so I always say choose wisely this is the time to choose wisely [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3340.24s)]
*  and a lot of people they're on the fence because they you know they're like [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3345.24s)]
*  well this doesn't involve me or I don't want to get involved but the thing is that they are choosing to be with the devil by doing that [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3350.24s)]
*  and they're going to pay for it too [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3358.24s)]
*  what do you mean so you're saying that the people through whom evil flows are destroyed by evil? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3362.24s)]
*  yeah the people who do evil are destroyed by evil but the people who don't hate evil [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3369.24s)]
*  because we're commanded in the Torah to hate evil [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3377.24s)]
*  we're not supposed to tolerate or love it or look the other way or forgive it [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3383.24s)]
*  we're supposed to chase after it with hate to distinguish it from this planet [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3388.24s)]
*  and that's the only thing we're allowed to feel hate for not for another human being [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3395.24s)]
*  who happens to be captive of the force of the devil but the devil himself [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3404.24s)]
*  we are supposed to hate him and the evil he does by serving our God [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3409.24s)]
*  and by loving our God and loving what's good because God is good [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3419.24s)]
*  so when you're not choosing you are choosing you know what I mean? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3426.24s)]
*  you're choosing not to be on the right side you're choosing to go oh well it doesn't involve me [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3430.24s)]
*  well it does involve you and you're on the right wrong side of stuff that you didn't pick it picked for you [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3435.24s)]
*  like a lot of people will say well I'm not political I don't care about politics [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3443.24s)]
*  well that's fine but politics cares about you [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3448.24s)]
*  and you are not immune and I think these times are showing people that [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3451.24s)]
*  it doesn't matter if you think you're immune or you can you know immerse yourself in insignificant things [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3458.24s)]
*  it's still going to get you it's coming right now it's gathering forces coming for our country [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3467.24s)]
*  and you know it's past time for us to sit around doing going like well geez I hope somebody will do something about it [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3474.24s)]
*  it's way past that [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3483.24s)]
*  when when did this come to you? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3491.24s)]
*  oh boy it came to me when I was three years old [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3494.24s)]
*  I was three years old and I grew up in an apartment house I'm a Jew I don't know if you all know I'm a Jew [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3502.24s)]
*  I love being a Jew it is so much fun it is so much fun to be Jewish I'm telling you it's a blast [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3517.24s)]
*  it is it's so fun and um [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3527.24s)]
*  and I'm Jewish and my grandparents they sponsored a lot of people to come over after the Holocaust they sponsored [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3536.24s)]
*  I think it was 20 families to come over from concentration camps and my grandparents owned an apartment house [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3545.24s)]
*  and that's where I grew up and I grew up with survivors and every Friday night on for Shabbat dinner [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3554.24s)]
*  everyone would come to my grandmother's house you know and they had numbers on their arms [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3561.24s)]
*  and that's where I started my career actually because I always said my grandmother had a big like window a window seat [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3568.24s)]
*  and so I would go up there and entertain because I really don't like people all that much unless I'm on stage and they're watching me [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3582.24s)]
*  then I really love them you know but I'm not good on one-to-one things because I get tongue-tied and nervous [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3591.24s)]
*  but I really like to entertain and they all clap and stuff and I did my really good Shirley Temple impressions [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3598.24s)]
*  and I made my mom do my hair and ringlets and everything and my family lied to me and they told me that I was better than Shirley Temple and everything like that [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3606.24s)]
*  and I believed them until I was older and that was a horrible let down there [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3617.24s)]
*  but sometimes they would tell stories about what they had been through they didn't have you know they were in PTSD you know [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3627.24s)]
*  and I was the only kid around and so they often would point to me this is a lot of why I'm really neurotic and stuff [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3642.24s)]
*  and they would point to me and they would say little girls like her and then they would tell a horrible thing that happened [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3656.24s)]
*  what happened? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3666.24s)]
*  huh? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3670.24s)]
*  what? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3675.24s)]
*  I don't know what you're saying [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3680.24s)]
*  oh well I love you too you're so nice thank you [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3682.24s)]
*  well so they was always pointing to me and going little girls like her they did this and that [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3686.24s)]
*  they were watching the Eichmann trial on TV you know and they and I'd come in and they'd go don't let her watch it but then my aunt said go no she should see this [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3693.24s)]
*  I would never show my kids when they were three what I saw [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3707.24s)]
*  but you know it's horrifying and I got horrible PTSD from it too and a lot of other mental things like obsessive compulsive and a whole bunch of ticks [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3711.24s)]
*  but so I wanted to get away from them I went in the bathroom and locked the bathroom door I was only three and they all were coming to hey Rosie [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3725.24s)]
*  turn the black knob and you know oh she's locked you know they were Jewish so they're like oh my god she's locked herself in the bathroom [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3734.24s)]
*  she's locked herself in the bathroom [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3742.24s)]
*  how's she gonna get away from all the fire department [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3746.24s)]
*  but I was in there I was like I locked them out and it was great [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3754.24s)]
*  and so I was just all in the bathroom alone and it was really fun and stuff all by myself there without them there and I had a vision [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3760.24s)]
*  and I had this vision and I saw I saw I saw a vision and you know I told people this my whole life and they're going oh my god she needs shock treatments and psychiatric care [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3772.24s)]
*  she needs to get her you know you know you wouldn't believe till I stopped talking about it till I was older [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3789.24s)]
*  but yeah I did see a vision and it was I guess I don't know what it was but it was a guy you know a man and he pointed at me just like they had pointed at me [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3797.24s)]
*  and he told me without words you're gonna live [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3812.24s)]
*  he said you're going to survive this and he said and one day you're gonna have an answer to every question that's in your mind right now [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3819.24s)]
*  and I'm gonna be with you every step of the way and you're gonna find those answers in books because I loved books when I was little [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3831.24s)]
*  and you know I've read thousands of books and I always find the answers in my mind I'll tell about that later [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3842.24s)]
*  and then he told me he said and you're gonna have your own television show and it's gonna be called Roseanne [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3853.24s)]
*  the most interesting and newsworthy television show of the year is coming here to TCN we are not bragging that's actually true [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3864.24s)]
*  the president's been shot I repeat the president's been shot [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3873.24s)]
*  so our longtime producer Justin Wells and a team have been embedded with no publicity at all with Donald Trump on the campaign trail for months [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3878.24s)]
*  they're the only crew capturing what is going on on the campaign in real time intimately [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3886.24s)]
*  they're with Trump as he campaigns for the presidency across the country and they've shot some amazing footage that shows you what it's really like in there [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3892.24s)]
*  so if you're a member you'll soon be able to get this docu-series covering the historic campaign, the fall of Joe Biden, never before seen footage from the assassination attempt [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3900.24s)]
*  of the Butler township of Pennsylvania, Trump rally and a lot more [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3908.24s)]
*  it's gonna pull back the curtain completely they are embedded inside the campaign I can't wait to see it personally [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3912.24s)]
*  but to get it first go to tuckercarlson.com become a member of the greatest television event of the year we're proud to offer it [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3918.24s)]
*  so that's why I know there is a God because it came true you know so I knew it was a God force that was saying that to me [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3931.24s)]
*  so I was like yeah and then it happened so I don't have any doubts about if there's a God or not because of that you know [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3942.24s)]
*  do you have doubts about whether good or evil wins in the end? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3951.24s)]
*  oh no I have no doubts at all whether good or evil win I know good always wins it takes its time though because you know a lot of people have to wake up [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3957.24s)]
*  because they don't even know what's the difference between good and evil and we got a lot of people in our country they still are blind to it [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3967.24s)]
*  they don't they don't see that they're supporting evil they have no idea and you know but now it's so in their face [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3974.24s)]
*  I think that God is pulling the veil off of all of it in front of us and every day don't you just see it? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3983.24s)]
*  every day it's getting harder and harder not to see it and I think that these people they have to work really hard not to see it and not to put the pieces together [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=3994.24s)]
*  and that's why we don't have any journalists because journalists are supposed to put the severed parts together for us to get the picture [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4005.24s)]
*  so that's why they knew they couldn't have any of them you know we have to be like I say unified field of bullshit [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4015.24s)]
*  that's what we have for media because if they were to tell the truth people would get the picture clearly and wouldn't allow it [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4024.24s)]
*  but they have plausible deniability that's why they lie because people will go well maybe it isn't that they're stealing our country and selling it out from under us [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4036.24s)]
*  these people that pretend to represent us maybe maybe they're not making deals just for themselves and their families with the money we work up here to pay taxes and pay for all that stuff to kill to allow them to kill us [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4048.24s)]
*  you know maybe people would see real clearly what's being done to the people of our country and particularly what's being done to the children in our country and to the children they're bringing to this country [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4069.24s)]
*  and to the genocide that is happening to those children that they're bringing to this country and to the genocide that's going on to the children in this country [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4088.24s)]
*  how would you describe that genocide? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4102.24s)]
*  oh it's just so complete on every single level it's fierce well you know what is it like they say 80,000 children just disappeared that were brought over here but that isn't even taking into account what I know [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4104.24s)]
*  when I came to Hollywood well always I was involved in stuff having to do with mental health and being a mental health patient myself I always saw behind that veil that iron curtain of what they do to people who have mental health issues what they do in hospitals [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4124.24s)]
*  yeah there's so many of us and you know being committed to mental hospitals several times in my life having about you know 150 nervous breakdowns and such over the course of my life [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4148.24s)]
*  just shout shit out whatever but no but I would be in mental institutions with other young people so I would hear from them what was going on in the hospital and I would be in mental institutions with other young people so I would hear from them what was going on in the hospital [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4163.24s)]
*  but no but I would be in mental institutions with other young people so I would hear from them what was going on in their lives and so I always knew because they told me and when I came to Hollywood people regarded me as a mother figure you know and they still do and I love it and I you know love it love children [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4184.24s)]
*  I love children of all ages but people would come to me kids in Hollywood and you know they would tell me things a lot of them that never told their own parents and I would listen because I felt like that was part of [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4212.24s)]
*  why God allowed me to have what I got you know because I owed that you know I felt like I owed that in telling the story of this family that was archetypical to me of all the great families I grew up with that were working class and poor you know right on that line and just were so noble [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4235.24s)]
*  you know that's what I wanted to bring to television because I was so sick of seeing working people insulted all the time particularly you know I was just sick of it so I would sit there watching TV and go when I get the Roseanne show you know we're going to show you know how indispensable these people are the people who make everything go [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4263.24s)]
*  and I always regarded it as a spiritual you know mission to do that and plus that made me feel good you know to do it because I knew that it wasn't I knew they didn't I knew the people in charge didn't value it nor did they value the people at home that were making them all their money and watching it and buying all their products and all that stuff [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4292.24s)]
*  so I sort of felt like a pirate a pirate yeah I always imagine myself a pirate and this one friend of mine was a great professor of linguistics and theology and she wrote that people like us writers that we are pirates on the subliminal seas don't you love that? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4321.24s)]
*  I kind of do pirates on the subliminal seas and stealing back what was stolen from us so it worked I mean it was the biggest show in America and then it became really clear to everyone in Hollywood that the people you portrayed and the people who watch the show were like 100% Trump voters oh yeah and so they always hated the working class they always hated the working class [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4346.24s)]
*  they always hated the working class why I've never understood that um because they work I don't know I didn't grow up in the working class I always kind of thought they were great they could do stuff they had actual skills it wasn't just like all private equity I mean they like made stuff yeah well these peculiar people in Hollywood they're not like you or they're not like anybody [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4374.24s)]
*  what are they like? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4403.24s)]
*  well they're just very arrogant and very ignorant they have no real life they're narcissists first of all they don't have any real relationships with anybody you know they don't have any real friendships they don't have any integrity or authenticity or nothing they're just they're just phantoms [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4405.24s)]
*  phantoms I think they're phantoms I always say when I talk to people I think we need a new definition for what is a human being what do you mean and what is the definition of the human being well to me [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4434.24s)]
*  I think you're being asked to comment on Diddy [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4452.24s)]
*  oh on Diddy [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4460.24s)]
*  okay but first I want to finish what I because I said this I I talked some a little while ago a week or so ago but people were agreeing with me because I think well a human being cares about life [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4463.24s)]
*  yes [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4477.24s)]
*  a human being loves life and living things and doesn't and has empathy for living things and other human beings and I think that's the big thing it respects a human being respects life wants things to live loves life and feels empathy for other living things [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4479.24s)]
*  amen that's a what I agree with that definition a hundred percent and there are some people well they look like people but you know and they act like people sort of but but they don't have none of that they they like they like the idea of blood and war and death they really dig that because it means [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4507.24s)]
*  they're going to make another hundred bucks or something [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4534.24s)]
*  so are you suggesting they're not fully human [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4538.24s)]
*  I don't think they're human I you know I'm a biblical student you know I and so no I don't think they're human [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4542.24s)]
*  in the Bible it says is anyone interested in hearing me [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4554.24s)]
*  I told I always tell this to my family they're used to me but I'm like you know I always lose all my friends and stuff because you know nobody likes to hear somebody that just talks about the Bible 24 seven they're like oh my god give it a rest get something else to talk about you know people are bored with me when I do but I I love it not so I just like to find other people that'll do that with me [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4562.24s)]
*  but I'm glad there's some of y'all there [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4591.24s)]
*  thanks for thanks for that [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4603.24s)]
*  well it says that [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4607.24s)]
*  you're sweet thank you it says some of us are people and then some of us are messengers and messengers or angels they come in two forms negative and positive [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4622.24s)]
*  but a messenger or an angel it doesn't have a soul [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4640.24s)]
*  it and here's what it says about a soul so if you know if you are a soul or a messenger a lot of people don't know [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4648.24s)]
*  huh if you are a soul a soul is capable of change a soul can change its mind it can change its behavior [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4660.24s)]
*  it can repent it can grow it can get better it can do better you know it can change a messenger cannot change it's only here to tempt those who have souls [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4679.24s)]
*  it tempts them to do bad or to do good [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4705.24s)]
*  so you think that it says the devil Satan his Hebrew in Hebrew what he is is the prosecutor [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4715.24s)]
*  because when you go to heaven for judgment in the court he shows up as the prosecutor on the other side because he knows your sins better than you do [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4732.24s)]
*  so if we're trying you're saying if we're trying to assess people the ability to repent and change is the number one way we understand what we're dealing with [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4747.24s)]
*  right and so a lot of these things a lot of these messengers are they are like phantoms and we can create them in our mind with [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4760.24s)]
*  when we are not honest with ourselves and we're not right with God and we just like project our own crap onto everybody else we can create a phantom that way by projection [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4775.24s)]
*  so now if we get a good angel or good messenger that brings us good a good message that lifts us that's a gift from God you know that to do better you know to go the right way [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4792.24s)]
*  but a lot of us I don't what do you say Donald Trump I'm gonna tell you all about Trump in a minute and but a negative messenger they just want you to mess up because then they've got you and when you think your got [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4809.24s)]
*  when you think your sins are so great you go all to hell I'll never get better and then you just keep doing bad so that's the trick you know we've all seen that yeah you've known Trump a long time how would you assess Trump [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4833.24s)]
*  I think that he's a I think that he's a he's biblical I think he's messianic he's a messianic figure to me and it also says that every you know Torah also says that every tribe of human you know every tribe of being is here to [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4850.24s)]
*  fix itself through repentance and you know by being real honest with yourself and you know going to God and saying I did this like to have the capacity for self-reflection and Trump is doing Trump I think is here to do the lifting for our country everything that [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4877.24s)]
*  our country did that was bad he's here to lift us out of that and take us into the good well he certainly revealed a lot of it I will say that I always think of Trump that the main looking back a hundred years from now I think it'll be clear that because of Trump a lot of us I'm in the category for sure [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4903.24s)]
*  I lived in DC I had no idea what was going on in the city I lived with among the people who were my neighbors I had no clue until Trump showed up really I really didn't I mean I I really didn't I don't know it's like if you're if you're married to an alcoholic it's like all your friends know you're the last two [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4921.24s)]
*  know yeah that's and if you're living in it I mean I thought NATO was like a good thing I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had I had [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4926.24s)]
*  Oh my god I know you don't know when you're in the middle of how many people still think that like they like the Zalinsky and shit I can't even think I could lose my mind over that like they go oh he's Jewish well he's a F a Nazi's a [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4956.24s)]
*  I don't care what I mean I just lose my mind for this stuff do you meet anyone who agrees with you [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4975.76s)]
*  just checking [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4990.72s)]
*  more and more for a long time well not in Hollywood hell no not in Hollywood no I never met nobody [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=4992.12s)]
*  that agreed with me in Hollywood what did they think of you oh well they you know when I would say oh they just hated my guts and they were terrified of me too why I thought they were terrified of me because I was a woman for one thing [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5004.8s)]
*  they're terrified of women yeah especially especially the kind of women they got out there are terrified of women like me they're terrified what what kind of women do they have out there whores [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5026.4s)]
*  I noticed that you're a you're a word minserf where'd you learn that but they are though you know they are they don't have any you know they don't know self none has any self it's just a bore they're all bores and you know like [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5042.44s)]
*  I was a woman I mean I'm a comic you know like I think they were shocked I think the first time I ever went to a meeting at the network there that was something they were like it didn't compute it's like somebody like her I mean she should be serving us coffee that's how they looked at she should be serving us coffee or cleaning up something [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5072.36s)]
*  and here she is telling us what she what she didn't go to Harvard none of that shit oh you didn't go to Harvard no nor Princeton none of that shit okay no and they're like geez you dropped she's a high school dropout and she's sitting up here telling these network people what to do and so I think they did [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5100.32s)]
*  like me for that you know plus I said things like when they'd say well they'd say crazy stuff like they'd go like they'd say like this well Roseanne would never say that they'd say that to me Roseanne would never say that they'd say that to me Roseanne would never say that and I go what are you talking about and they go not you Roseanne [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5130.32s)]
*  they're psycho I go but I am Roseanne what the hell are you talking about I am Roseanne I know what Roseanne would say trust me she would say that and they say no you don't understand there's a difference between you and the character you portray no there isn't [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5160.32s)]
*  there's no difference between myself and the character that I portray I write the fucking jokes you asshole I'm sorry excuse me I'm so dirty and awful I'm sorry but they made me so mad and then they go like this they go well we feel that that is not the right way to go and so I'm sorry [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5188.32s)]
*  so you know I just got madder and madder because you know I came from nothing you know we ate the welfare cheese in my family which was very unusual for Jews to be on the welfare cheese it was but uh but uh so I say you know what you're making a big mistake I go like you're thinking the wrong [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5218.32s)]
*  way this this ain't a democracy okay it's a queendom it ain't no democracy up in here okay it's a queendom read the name of the show and so then it was like god she's such a bitch then it was like she's a bitch and then I'd see him like with Jerry Seinfeld and the men they'd go oh he is just he knows what he wants [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5247.32s)]
*  you know he's a great leader he really stands there and he stands out he knows what he wants he has the vision she's a big fat bitch they always did that to me that drove me crazy because I knew what they were doing even though I think they're they're very for women's rights I thought [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5272.32s)]
*  they're pretty big feminists aren't they I think they like fun planned parenthood it's kind of weird they didn't listen to you well I wouldn't that I wasn't that kind I was oh I know I wasn't that way I was like well the mom you know the mom and the dad I like there to be a mom and a dad you know I like there to be a male and a female in the family [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5292.32s)]
*  and the power equation you know I I like men and you know Hollywood everybody's gay as hell ask me ask me who's gay I'll tell you just ask me I'll tell you did he oh they're all gay as hell I always knew they were gay as hell too because when they're getting out they're going I'm a man and I [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5322.32s)]
*  there's nothing but bitches and they don't listen that gay right gay well let's just get on the list on who's gay then and you know I said I my brother and sister is both gay you know and that's why I put gay characters on [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5351.32s)]
*  TV because you know we all love the gays and I said you know because I grew up with the gays and everything and and you know I love my brother and sister and you know they've been with the same people for 35 and 38 years and you know I've been married nine or ten times so you can't go by the stereotype there [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5380.32s)]
*  so I wanted to present you know normal people they're married and they have children you know they're and I said well but the bad thing about giving the voiceless a voice they never shut the fuck up that's the problem there but now they should have quit back when they got yeah they didn't need to go this far you know come on it's all about the middle right the vast middle there [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5402.32s)]
*  the extremes have marginalized the middle it's it's insane ain't it how did they marginalize Main Street well they they've decided and they've succeeded in making people with normal goals like getting married to have kids by house send the kids to summer camp like these are not crazy by a helicopter take over the world goals no but all of a sudden you're like a freak if you want to have children [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5430.32s)]
*  shut up and freeze your eggs and go back to work at the bank no no but for real I know most people I know have including me pretty moderate goals I know yeah like but those are considered heteronormative or racist or something but no every person regardless of what they look like or where they're from [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5460.32s)]

*  where are you on wiener flashing no but I'm saying the people showing their wieners to the kids they're saying that we're offensive they're the ones saying we're offensive it does seem what were you saying earlier about projecting yeah because they have no self what does that mean so they have no self can you just flesh that a little bit well I think when they look in the mirror they don't see a reflection [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5499.32s)]
*  because they have no self reflection all they do is go after everybody else but they don't go hey man I have I have total double standards I'm watching everybody on you know everybody who loves Trump going to prison and everybody on my side who's done ten times worse they don't even get arrested or get a ticket they have an arrested [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAqczZ-1Vo&t=5528.32s)]
