# Mike Cernovich on Donald Trump, Demons, and Feds Embedded in the Conservative Movement
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk)
*  Clinton versus Trump. We're talking about the fate of human civilization. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4.74s)]
*  I say this to this day and I believe with all my heart that the people who voted for Trump in 2016 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5.24s)]
*  did the greatest act of human charity and maybe human history because tens of millions would have died had Hillary Clinton won. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=10.0s)]
*  The table was set for war with Russia. We were able to delay that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=16.7s)]
*  Anybody who tells you don't shelter your kids, groomer, shelter your kids. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=20.62s)]
*  Why do you tell me not to shelter my kids? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=24.7s)]
*  Don't lock your doors at night. Really? Okay, you're an armed robber. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=27.2s)]
*  That's weird. Don't shelter my kids. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=32.4s)]
*  We appealed the Second Circuit Court appeals in New York. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=34.4s)]
*  This is during the Trump administration. Epstein is still free, hasn't been arrested. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=37.8s)]
*  A friend of mine, one of the good guys in the intelligence community said, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=40.8s)]
*  Hey, just so you know, you shouldn't mention Epstein anymore. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=44.099999999999994s)]
*  You're in a real problem. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=46.8s)]
*  They go, you got into something really that you didn't know what you were getting into. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=48.4s)]
*  And I go, okay, what do you want to do? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=51.8s)]
*  They go, just stand by. You need to not draw attention to this issue yourself. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=53.2s)]
*  And I said, okay, that's message received. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=57.1s)]
*  How do you live on the internet without having it destroy your brain? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=80.0s)]
*  I went through that in 2017 and where I felt like my brain was becoming a little bit dopamine fried. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=83.5s)]
*  So for me, I just said, I'll just do less. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=89.9s)]
*  And I went to DC less and I did less of... [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=94.0s)]
*  I made myself irrelevant in a way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=98.8s)]
*  So there was a point where I was on a... [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=101.3s)]
*  I was on real arc to be a big deal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=103.4s)]
*  And then my brain was getting fried. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=106.6s)]
*  I looked at videos of myself. My face was all red. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=109.2s)]
*  I was just had this inflammation because the cortisol and I was getting calls from people in DC three or four in the morning. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=111.4s)]
*  And I was breaking a bunch of stories. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  So I was like, oh, phone, kids. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  And I realized I was losing myself to this world, this digital world. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=123.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=127.4s)]
*  And then I go, man, I don't want to... [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  This sucks, dude. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=129.3s)]
*  I'm going to have to figure something out. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=130.1s)]
*  Can I ask you, what do you mean it's cortisol? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=131.5s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=133.4s)]
*  A stress hormone. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=134.4s)]
*  So when you're under stress, fight or flight response, you're going to have cortisol. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=135.4s)]
*  And then cortisol is inflammatory. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=140.0s)]
*  And then that's what makes a lot of people who maybe are healthy look a little stressed out because you bloat, you hold water. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=142.3s)]
*  There's a lot of things that go with it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=149.4s)]
*  So a lot of people, when you leave a high stress job, people will be, oh, I lost 10 pounds. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=151.5s)]
*  No, you lost about five or 10 pounds of water because you're not... [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=159.9s)]
*  Oh, the buzz, the buzz. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=163.8s)]
*  Oh, I got to respond to that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=165.8s)]
*  Wait, so you felt like you were succeeding too much? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=168.1s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=170.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=172.1s)]
*  I love that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=172.6s)]
*  Yeah, objectively. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and then... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  Most people fret about not being successful enough. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=177.4s)]
*  Yeah, but it's how you define your spiritual world or how you define what you want to do with life. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=179.6s)]
*  And I noticed that I got tired of people, like, for example, like me doing this episode with you, I almost didn't do it because I go, oh, man, I'm going to have a bunch of people texting me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=185.2s)]
*  How do I get on Tucker? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=197.0s)]
*  What's Tucker's number? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=198.4s)]
*  Can you get this thing to Tucker? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=199.8s)]
*  Everyone has my number. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=200.8s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=202.0s)]
*  The people... [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=203.6s)]
*  Like everyone on the planet has my number. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=204.1s)]
*  But they're so incapable, they can't find it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=206.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=208.2s)]
*  And then my DMs will be blowing up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=209.3s)]
*  And that was the problem is people, oh, get this to Don Jr. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=211.6s)]
*  I saw that you were a thing where Don Jr. is. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=215.3s)]
*  Get this to Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=217.6s)]
*  And I go, no, man, this is not really what it's about. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=218.6s)]
*  So the only real way to describe how I ended up in this weird world was it was a gonzo. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=221.5s)]
*  It was a ride. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=229.5s)]
*  It wasn't a deliberate, calculated move. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=230.7s)]
*  How can I become a whatever? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=233.8s)]
*  Because I was an influencer before there was a term influencer. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=236.3s)]
*  I was recognized in public for what I wrote on the Internet. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=240.1s)]
*  This is before you can make any money doing it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=243.3s)]
*  This was before there were brand deals. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=245.4s)]
*  This was just people had blogs or people on social media blowing off steam or goofing off or whatever. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  And I was very early to what's now known as an influencer. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  But so you start, I mean, you had a completely different life. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  You're a lawyer. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=263.7s)]
*  You live in California, but you're not from there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=266.5s)]
*  You're not basically where you decided where you thought you would be 20 years ago. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=268.7s)]
*  But you start succeeding in this new world. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=273.1s)]
*  But I still don't understand how it came to you that you don't want to be as successful as you are. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=276.0s)]
*  Well, I decided I want to become irrelevant. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=282.0s)]
*  And the reason is because that's the opposite of what most people want. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. I wanted to be. I was I have a story about this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=288.0s)]
*  I won't say who it is, but I was having dinner with a friend of mine and I was working on my next book, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  which was called Audacity, How to Go from Nobody to Somebody. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=295.5s)]
*  And it was a discussion of again, influencing before people knew them as influencers. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=298.8s)]
*  And it was about brand building, getting your message out rhetoric. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=305.3s)]
*  And I was having dinner with my friend and he goes, you know what? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  By the time you finish this book, you're not going to publish it and you're going to call it how to become a nobody. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=310.9s)]
*  And I kind of laughed and said, oh, ha ha ha. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  He was he was right. I never released the book. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=318.8s)]
*  And he wrote the book but didn't publish it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Just felt it was too vainglorious. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=323.2s)]
*  Felt it was too self celebratory. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=325.9s)]
*  I felt like my ego was seeking external validation too much. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=328.4s)]
*  And then I was losing who I was and losing what I wanted to do. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  And because I my whole philosophy is how did you come to that? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=338.7s)]
*  Did your wife mention it to you or no, no, I've quiet moment. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=343.29999999999995s)]
*  You realized you were going to become a worse person. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  You just you feel it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=349.5s)]
*  So subtle little things and little gestures. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=350.9s)]
*  You would Google your name. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=355.0s)]
*  I don't have a Google. I learn on my name. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know anything people occasional send me this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=358.3s)]
*  Have you seen this? No. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=360.1s)]
*  And I'm not trying to act like I'm too cool for school, but I don't do that because you Google your name. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=361.8s)]
*  You'd name search yourself on Twitter. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=366.7s)]
*  What are people saying? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=368.7s)]
*  Do I got to respond to this? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=370.1s)]
*  And you become a little you become a brand, not a person. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=371.7s)]
*  Right. Or you become an account. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=374.5s)]
*  That's how they refer to people on X formerly known as Twitter. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=376.8s)]
*  Oh, that's an account. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=380.0s)]
*  And I say no, but that's what happens. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  You lose your humanity and you're no longer humanity. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=383.2s)]
*  You're more like a cyborg or you're living in an augmented reality of social media where you whoever you are doesn't exist. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=386.8s)]
*  And you're engaging in some kind of performative dance for a mob of people who are who necessarily don't necessarily have your best interest in mind. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=395.5s)]
*  Who's that that completely crazed chick who has the mental breakdowns on camera? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=404.7s)]
*  I think she works The Washington Post. She's from Greenwich. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=409.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Taylor Lorenz. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=411.8s)]
*  Taylor Lorenz. Yeah. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=412.8s)]
*  On one hand is loathsome. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=414.90000000000003s)]
*  But every time I've ever seen her, I just maybe I have too many daughters. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=416.0s)]
*  I feel so sorry for her because she's clearly been destroyed by what you're describing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=419.5s)]
*  A lot of people do. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=424.3s)]
*  There's a certain look some people have when they're in front of a camera and where they're this is where they want to be. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=425.6s)]
*  Right. They hammered up for the camera. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=431.7s)]
*  Yeah. And I had always been the opposite. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=433.5s)]
*  So for me, my biggest if I had an influence on this, it was I don't know if you ever watched him. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=435.8s)]
*  Dr. Eugene Scott on satellite radio. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=442.0s)]
*  Well, Dr. Eugene Scott from my childhood in California. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=445.0s)]
*  There you go. Even better. The University Cathedral. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=447.5s)]
*  Yeah. The guy, the public access guy who would sit in a chair on the telephone and yell at viewers. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=450.4s)]
*  When I when I was like six or seventh grade, my brother and I would fire up a bowl and watch Dr. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=455.5s)]
*  Gene and he hated his viewers. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=461.9s)]
*  He would say, you're not you're disgusting. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=464.0s)]
*  I told you to send me money and his phone bank behind him. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=466.5s)]
*  That's the guy. The voices of faith. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=468.7s)]
*  He was incredible. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=470.2s)]
*  Yeah, I grew up. So we had a bootleg satellite radio transmitter and we picked up Dr. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=471.1s)]
*  Eugene Scott and he's probably the greatest influence on me and how I do media because I'll go on these. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=477.6s)]
*  Is anyone listening to this or watching this? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=486.6s)]
*  Just hit pause. Go on to YouTube. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=489.70000000000005s)]
*  See any other tapes of it? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=491.6s)]
*  He's got to be long head. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He died years ago. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=494.3s)]
*  One of my life's regrets is I never went to the University Cathedral before he died. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=496.0s)]
*  And that was one of my momentum or your moments. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=500.4s)]
*  So he because his his affect his way of communicating was like so strange. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  How was he an influence on you? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=509.2s)]
*  You seem much less strange. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay, he sits around reading books, the most obscure knowledge and would go down these deep rabbit holes that nobody really cared about. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=512.3s)]
*  And then am I boring you? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=520.9s)]
*  Am I boring you? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  And he would scream. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=523.5s)]
*  Am I boring you? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=524.6s)]
*  Do you want to hear more? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=525.3s)]
*  Get all the telephones and then they have these horse videos because he was. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=525.9s)]
*  And you just see these horses videos and I thought this is the coolest mo mofo that I've ever seen in my life. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=531.0s)]
*  This guy's amazing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=537.6s)]
*  And he was a PhD. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=538.9s)]
*  He's a brilliant guy. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=539.8s)]
*  Genius guy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=540.5s)]
*  He'd know all this trivia and I thought man, that's cool. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=541.4s)]
*  I kind of want to be that guy when I grow up and did anyone else on your block want to be Dr. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=545.2s)]
*  Gene Scott? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=550.1s)]
*  I don't know that anybody in the world wanted to be the world. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=551.0s)]
*  I don't know anyone else but me found in this to be an aspirational character. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=555.0s)]
*  And I would watch him for hours a week, especially because it was the only thing that might because we were very strict house. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=559.4s)]
*  So what we could watch my dad will let me watch him forever. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=565.5s)]
*  So for me, that was one of the few things that I could watch and I could watch it with my dad and I was I was obsessed with his delivery style. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  I thought it was cool. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=575.8s)]
*  They just sat around and read books because if you think about it, people go, what do you do for a living? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=576.5s)]
*  And the answer is that I read books and write about what I read and what I find interesting. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=580.6999999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=584.6999999999999s)]
*  And there's no more there to it than that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=586.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of there there if you look at it in that context. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=590.3s)]
*  So he would be framed by piles of books and it would be the most weird stuff at least growing up in a small town book. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=593.3s)]
*  She'd never heard of we didn't have amazon.com back then. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=599.5s)]
*  And I thought that'd be cool. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=603.5s)]
*  Just sit around read books, talk shit, yell at people who are watching you scream go on tirades, smoke cigars. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=605.5s)]
*  Where do I sign up for this? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=613.2s)]
*  How do I do this? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=614.3s)]
*  Watching it was was almost like a masochistic experience because he hated you. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=615.0s)]
*  But he commanded your attention and then told you to send him money and a lot of people did. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=620.9s)]
*  Well, I don't know that he hated you as much as I because I grew up and watching pro wrestling too. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=625.7s)]
*  I viewed it more as a bit because I think that he had a genuine smiley effect to him. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=629.4s)]
*  And I think that he did. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=635.7s)]
*  I think that he was happy and enjoying what he was doing. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=637.1s)]
*  I viewed it much less that he had contempt for his audience but more that he was a rabble rouser and he was doing a bit of a pro wrestling bet. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=640.2s)]
*  He was a heel. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=648.7s)]
*  He was an intellectual heel. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=649.9s)]
*  So if you look at Ric Flair was Ric Flair a good guy or bad guy where Ric Flair didn't hate the audience. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=651.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=656.1s)]
*  The bad guys would run in the iron sheik would run in cussing people out. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  He didn't hate his audience. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=661.9s)]
*  That was his bit. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=662.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=663.4s)]
*  So Dr. Eugene Scott that was his bit. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=664.1s)]
*  He was a heel and intellectual heel and he was having fun. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=665.9s)]
*  I think the audience was was in on it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=669.9s)]
*  And if the audience is in on the bit then it becomes fun. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=672.5s)]
*  Now that's I that's a much deeper reading than I was capable of giving it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=674.8s)]
*  But I think you're right. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  So you decide to disappear become less relevant. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=680.5s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=684.5s)]
*  And did it work? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=685.3s)]
*  Absolutely worked. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=686.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't have people asking me to to find out how to get in touch with anybody in the Trump campaign or anybody who's just pull back from politics then. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=687.6999999999999s)]
*  Well unless I pulled back from politics. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=696.8s)]
*  I did this video and I thought one of my epiphanies was I was reading a book and because it goes both ways. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=698.3s)]
*  So I don't know if you've ever gone to a modern bookstore anymore, but it's pretty depressing. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=705.8s)]
*  And then you'll see a book and you'll see the author is some crank on Twitter that is a completely not credible person. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=709.5s)]
*  So I can't read history books anymore because I read these historians on on X and I got all of their lying about Trump. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  I can't listen to Dan Carlin podcast hardcore history. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=722.4s)]
*  I can't listen to any of this because when you read what they're writing about contemporaneous events, you realize there's nothing about them that you can trust in any of their storytelling. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=725.2s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=734.0s)]
*  And then I reached another epiphany where I was reading. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=734.9s)]
*  I like Paul, Paulo Aquella books a lot and he did. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=739.2s)]
*  He's famous for the Alchemist, but he's written a bunch of other little side quest books. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=742.6s)]
*  I read hippie recently and I thought I don't know what this guy looks like. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=746.1s)]
*  I wouldn't know if I saw this guy in public. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=750.7s)]
*  I don't really care what he had for dinner, but I like his books. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=752.7s)]
*  And then I thought I want to be more of a book as a metaphor. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=756.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm a book. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=761.4000000000001s)]
*  You read my ex account, you scroll, you read it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=762.2s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=765.2s)]
*  You get mad because I maybe word things in a way that you don't like, but you don't really care that much about me. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=765.9000000000001s)]
*  The person right is more of the words. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=771.9000000000001s)]
*  Whereas when I was doing a lot of live streams, a lot of videos there becomes more of an emotional component to it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=775.1s)]
*  Because TV is way more powerful. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=781.3s)]
*  Videos way more powerful than audio. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=783.4s)]
*  Video is way more powerful than the written word, but less enduring. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=785.4s)]
*  So in my mind, I thought while do fewer streams because I would do these very popular live streams, I just quit doing them. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=789.5999999999999s)]
*  And I found that that made me significantly less relevant, but happier, more content. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=796.6999999999999s)]
*  That, you know, there's a great book on the happiness hypothesis. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=803.5999999999999s)]
*  I've studied the philosophers, you know, as philosophy major in college. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=807.2s)]
*  And I learned that happiness is a dragon. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=811.8000000000001s)]
*  Really, it's not a destination is more about it can only be obtained indirectly. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=814.9000000000001s)]
*  So I think less about happiness. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=820.6s)]
*  And I kind of rejected that. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=823.0s)]
*  Oh, are you happy? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=824.7s)]
*  And more along the lines of is it meaningful? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=826.0s)]
*  Is it impactful? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=828.2s)]
*  Is it significant? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=828.9000000000001s)]
*  Is it having the desired outcome for the world and the desired outcome for me? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=830.6s)]
*  And in that regard, much less relaxed, much less stressed out. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=836.4s)]
*  I have much less cortisol pulsing through my body. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=840.5s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=843.6s)]
*  I can wind down easily. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=844.3s)]
*  So for example, I can raw dog a hike for hours and raw dogging a hike means no audiobook, no podcast, no radio, just me and my thoughts. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=845.4s)]
*  It's called raw dogging when you don't have electronics on you. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=856.9s)]
*  That's the new meme when you can raw dog. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=860.1s)]
*  That's so pathetic. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=863.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=864.9s)]
*  But that's how it like it's an achievement. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=865.5s)]
*  Well, we're all cyborgs now. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=868.2s)]
*  Not me. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=869.9s)]
*  Well, I hate that. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=870.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting there. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=872.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=873.4s)]
*  But if you can do that for hours, that's right. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=873.6s)]
*  I wear headphones in the gym. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=876.1s)]
*  So I did much less disconnecting from the augmented reality world or the virtual reality world and spent more time in physical world raw dogging. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=877.4s)]
*  I thought that was like no condom. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=885.9s)]
*  It is but you know, memes change and language usage change. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=887.9s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=891.6s)]
*  And that's amazing. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=892.2s)]
*  What's going to happen in this election? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=892.9s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen in November. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=894.5s)]
*  There's no way to know. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=896.1999999999999s)]
*  If you're wondering how big tech got powerful enough to void the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=897.3s)]
*  how did it get big enough to nullify the founding documents of the most powerful company in the world? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=903.8s)]
*  Well, simple. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=910.5s)]
*  They got really rich. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  Money is power. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, how'd they get rich? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=914.3s)]
*  From information, your information, which you keep giving to them. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=916.1s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=921.0s)]
*  Well, every time you use the internet unprotected, you're handing all of your online activity, all the details about you to Silicon Valley, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=921.7s)]
*  which sells it, including to government agencies, which use it to spy on you. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=931.4000000000001s)]
*  That's why it's probably not a good idea to go online unprotected, not just for your own sake, but for the sake of the country. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=937.0s)]
*  How do you fight back? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=944.1s)]
*  Well, with Express VPN. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=945.6s)]
*  Express VPN is an app that encrypts and reroutes 100% of your network traffic through secure servers. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=948.5s)]
*  What does that do? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=954.3s)]
*  Well, it makes everything you do online unreadable to your internet provider and then to data brokers and to the government agencies that buy that data. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=955.7s)]
*  That means anyone out there trying to profit from you and your personal data can't. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=965.6s)]
*  Well, how do we know it works? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=971.2s)]
*  Well, we know for a fact it works because this winter when my producers and I were in Russia conducting interviews, including with the president of that country, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=972.3s)]
*  internet traffic was getting blocked by the government. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=980.9s)]
*  So we got an Express VPN account and were able to get that interview out of the country securely and bring it to the world. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=983.4s)]
*  So it works. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=991.4s)]
*  We know it works. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=993.3s)]
*  Express VPN also keeps you safe from hackers, even on unsecured public Wi-Fi networks. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=994.9s)]
*  If you're in a coffee shop or an airport, you sign on with Express VPN and all of a sudden you're safe. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1000.6s)]
*  And by the way, it's easy to use even for people who don't know anything about tech like me. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1007.5s)]
*  You just tap one button and you're protected on any device. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1011.4s)]
*  That's your iPhone, your laptop, your tablet, you name it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1014.3s)]
*  If you've got it, Express VPN can protect it and it works up to eight devices at once. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1018.1s)]
*  Express VPN is rated number one by top tech reviewers like CNET and The Verge. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1023.7s)]
*  Express VPN protected our team for censorship across the world and it can protect you too. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1028.5s)]
*  So if you want to keep your privacy intact and fight back against the big tech surveillance machine, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1034.4s)]
*  now is the time to get Express VPN. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1040.0s)]
*  Use our special link to get three extra months of Express VPN for free. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1042.8000000000002s)]
*  Go to expressvpn.com backslash Tucker. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1048.1000000000001s)]
*  That's express vpn.com slash Tucker for three extra months free and we hope you will. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1051.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, if that's correct, that's so dark. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1060.8s)]
*  I almost don't want to dwell on it, but then that that's why it would be fine if Biden stayed then. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1064.1s)]
*  Well, we want Biden to run in November. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1071.2s)]
*  I think he's the weakest candidate that we can have, but there's a new enthusiasm happening. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1074.8s)]
*  Knowing that if Biden stays in the race, they have to save Biden because now there's real peril. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1081.1s)]
*  People took it for granted that Biden was going to win, Democrat voters especially, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1085.0s)]
*  and now they're thinking that he might not win and that'll drive more Democrat voter turnout. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1089.3s)]
*  It's going to be hotly contested, man. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1095.5s)]
*  It's going to be hotly contested. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1098.1999999999998s)]
*  People saying Trump's up two on this poll, Trump's up three on this poll. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1099.1s)]
*  None of that matters. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1102.1999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be a hotly contested election and people are getting lackadaisical. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1103.5s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, there's a huge scramble in Washington just to, you know, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1108.3s)]
*  I want to be secretary of this or secretary of that or I mean, they're acting like it's done. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1112.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're acting like they've won, which I don't like. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1118.2s)]
*  There's a lot of congressional races that are close that people need to watch out for. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1121.3999999999999s)]
*  Democrats might take the House. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1126.1s)]
*  They think they're going to take the House. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1128.3s)]
*  What's being done there? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1130.3s)]
*  And unfortunately, not much. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1131.7s)]
*  Unfortunately, people aren't running on the issues that they want to run on. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1134.0s)]
*  So for example, I was talking about this yesterday on X and in Orange County, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1136.6s)]
*  there's a real concern that Orange County could become like the Bolshevik run, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  Los Angeles County. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1146.3s)]
*  So a guy ran, Todd Spitzer ran for, which is right next door, right? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1147.5s)]
*  Ran for district attorney. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1151.6s)]
*  His campaign pen, his camp, Todd Spitzer ran for district attorney. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1153.8999999999999s)]
*  So yeah, in the district attorney election, the campaign slogan was no LA NOC. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1160.5s)]
*  He won by two to one margin. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1166.6s)]
*  Orange County. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1168.5s)]
*  What did he mean by that? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1169.1s)]
*  He meant no crime, no crime waves like they have in LA. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1170.6s)]
*  None of these homeless encampments, none of this bail reform so-called happening on [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1174.0s)]
*  Orange County. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1179.3s)]
*  Just like criminals. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1179.8s)]
*  Yeah, prostitute criminals, basic stuff. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1180.3999999999999s)]
*  It's in a way you feel like mentally stunted that you have these conversations. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1182.1s)]
*  No, it's so true. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1187.6s)]
*  It's your, you're in a surreal parallel reality where you go, oh no, you see the way to win [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1189.1s)]
*  Republicans is you want to enforce the criminal code against people who murder people. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1193.6s)]
*  You want to actually put criminals in jail and then you have these weird surrealist moments [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1199.1s)]
*  in yourself where you think, did I say that? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1205.1s)]
*  Am I stupid? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1207.1s)]
*  This is banal. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1208.1999999999998s)]
*  Why are we talking about this? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1209.3s)]
*  It's right. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1210.6s)]
*  And you go, no, but it is banal, it's utterly stupid. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1211.1999999999998s)]
*  And yet that's where we are as a society. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1214.5s)]
*  So you do have to talk about it. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1218.0s)]
*  You have to talk about it all the time. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1219.3s)]
*  You have to remind people of this all of the time because that is the dumb world that we [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1221.6000000000001s)]
*  live in. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1226.6000000000001s)]
*  And it does feel sometimes you demoralizing because you feel like you're talking below [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1227.5s)]
*  your intellect, right? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1232.8000000000002s)]
*  As a writer, as a speaker, you want to talk about issues that interest you and that you [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1234.2s)]
*  find novel, right? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1240.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I read this book. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1242.0s)]
*  What's this book you read? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1242.7s)]
*  What's that about? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1243.9s)]
*  Oh, I went down that rabbit hole. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1244.9s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1246.0s)]
*  And so much of our time, unfortunately, has to be devoted to saying, okay, Republicans, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1246.8s)]
*  crime is bad. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1252.6999999999998s)]
*  People don't want crime. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1253.8s)]
*  You're running. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1256.1999999999998s)]
*  You need to talk about crime. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1257.0s)]
*  And then you see them talking about everything but crime. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1258.8999999999999s)]
*  And you think, no, okay, I have to grab you by the shirt. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1261.8s)]
*  Todd Spitzer did talk about crime. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1265.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he won by two to one in a 50-50. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1267.0s)]
*  So that, well, I would think that every other Republican... [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1269.1s)]
*  Asked Michelle Steele, asked these Orange County Congress members how much they're talking [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1272.3s)]
*  about crime, asked them when's the last time they had a press conference about crime. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1276.2s)]
*  Oh, but I'm running for Congress. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1279.7s)]
*  It's a national issue. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1281.0s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1281.9s)]
*  It's local, right? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1282.7s)]
*  Running for Congress is not a national ballot referendum. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1284.8s)]
*  It is a local election. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1289.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1290.7s)]
*  You need to... [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1291.2s)]
*  And they don't understand these things. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1291.6000000000001s)]
*  And you think, how do you not understand these things? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1292.9s)]
*  And then I think, I'm wasting so much of my time with mediocre people who either have [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1295.2s)]
*  no will or they really are this dumb. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1301.9s)]
*  And what am I doing with my life? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1305.6s)]
*  So that's where you have these existential crises. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1307.1999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1309.1999999999998s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1309.6999999999998s)]
*  But it's... [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1310.8s)]
*  Why wouldn't you talk... [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1312.3s)]
*  I mean, crime, there's no defense of it at all. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1313.1s)]
*  So, and you're a Republican, you don't have to be for crime. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1317.1999999999998s)]
*  You're not for rape. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1320.1999999999998s)]
*  So why wouldn't they talk about it? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1321.8s)]
*  It can't just be stupidity. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1323.5s)]
*  They feel pressure not to. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1324.6999999999998s)]
*  I think that they don't understand the issues in the way they should and that they get too [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1326.6999999999998s)]
*  much caught up in the DC think tank realm. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1333.3999999999999s)]
*  And I don't think that they're being told you can't really talk about crime. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1336.8999999999999s)]
*  I think that in their gilded world, they don't understand what the issues really are [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1341.5s)]
*  concerning people. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1348.1s)]
*  They don't have any kind of concept of how bad it is in certain parts. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1349.5s)]
*  And I do think that they're afraid of the media attacks. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1353.3999999999999s)]
*  So when the Orange County issued attorney ran for office, the media, of course, attacked [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1355.6s)]
*  him, smeared him, fascism, far right this, that. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1359.5s)]
*  But he overwhelmingly won. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1362.8999999999999s)]
*  And as you know, Republicans are controlled by the media in terms of the narrative. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1364.5s)]
*  They're so afraid of a hit piece, right? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1369.3999999999999s)]
*  They're so afraid of negative press coverage that they allow the media to dictate the [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1372.2s)]
*  agenda. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1377.1s)]
*  But why would you let your enemies control you? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1377.3999999999999s)]
*  That's the philosophical question, right? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1380.0s)]
*  That's the question is why Republicans so pathetic. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1382.0s)]
*  And I've spent a lot of time thinking about that. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1384.8s)]
*  And I think that there is a strain of Christian negativity that people don't like to [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1388.0s)]
*  talk about because then it seems like you're oh, you hate Christians now, Cernovich. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1392.6s)]
*  You you're anti-Christian. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1396.1s)]
*  And I say, no, if you read the verses in the Bible, they say you got to be gentle as a [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1398.1s)]
*  dove, but wise as a serpent, right? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1402.0s)]
*  Everybody, everybody skips over that part and you have to ask where's the serpent type [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1404.0s)]
*  wisdom? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1411.0s)]
*  Where are you not understanding these issues? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1411.8s)]
*  Where are you not thinking? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1413.3s)]
*  Where are you not being shrewd? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1414.0s)]
*  And they aren't. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1415.6s)]
*  They have this negativity and they have this gullibility and they have this weakness that [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1416.6s)]
*  comes from being too nice. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1421.7s)]
*  So the biggest problem one of Nietzsche's great criticisms of Christians that I think has [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1423.2s)]
*  held up well with the inversion of morality and how Christians became a morality of a [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1427.8s)]
*  slave type morality, which is self-sacrifice, self-abnegation, denial of yourself. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1434.7s)]
*  Well, in one way, these are good Christian virtues, which is if you think your ego is [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1441.2s)]
*  getting out of control, it might be good to become a little bit less relevant. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1445.4s)]
*  It might be good to take a step back from the limelight. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1448.8s)]
*  These might be good things to do for your heart, but that doesn't mean you let somebody [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1451.0s)]
*  kick in the door and torture you to death, right? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1454.9s)]
*  Or rape your wife or hurt the people you love. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1458.2s)]
*  Or kill people, whatever the case is. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1461.3s)]
*  You don't let the end up like the Tsar lined up against the wall with your family while [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1463.3s)]
*  they both kill you, right? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1469.1s)]
*  There's too much of that strain of weakness that has infected a lot of the modern Christian [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1471.4s)]
*  traditions to where they don't have really an understanding of it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1478.8s)]
*  And they're the Ned Flanders, all by golly gee, can't we all get along kind of types. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1481.6s)]
*  And then because of that, they're more open to being persuaded by evil forces because [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1487.6s)]
*  they don't have that strong grounding and that courage to stand up against evil. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1493.0s)]
*  Well, they certainly lack courage. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1497.5s)]
*  What's evil? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1499.2s)]
*  How are we defining evil? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1500.0s)]
*  We define evil as anti-human. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1501.6s)]
*  If you start from, I like CS Lewis's take on this, which is whether it's true or not, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1503.7s)]
*  I think it's a good way to, by true, I mean, whether it's a metaphor or it's literally [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1508.9s)]
*  true, people can debate. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1513.3000000000002s)]
*  But if you think of the fall of the angels and then you think of humanity, you would [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1515.2s)]
*  understand that the demons are at war with God's creations, humans, because humans still [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1521.9s)]
*  have God's love. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1528.1000000000001s)]
*  Humans are still capable of experiencing divine grace and experiencing God's love, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1529.1s)]
*  whereas the demons who rebelled during the fall are not. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1534.7s)]
*  So what they want to do is implement anti-humanist policies and have human suffering [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1538.0s)]
*  and have human despair. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1544.1s)]
*  And you can feel that force again, whether it's a literal one involving actual forces [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1545.9s)]
*  or whether that's a metaphor, you could say that evil would be anti-human. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1551.8s)]
*  But, I mean, it almost has to be a supernatural phenomenon because by definition, human [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1556.7s)]
*  beings would not be inclined to be anti-human. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1563.2s)]
*  Animals don't act against their own interests. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1566.0s)]
*  Animals don't commit suicide. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1567.9s)]
*  There's a lot of strange elements of the human condition, a lot of... [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1569.3s)]
*  That suggest outside forces that are not human acting on humans. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1573.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, humans given to despair in a way that animals don't. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1576.5s)]
*  Despair would be incomprehensible to other animals. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1580.4s)]
*  What's that wonderful D.H. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1583.9s)]
*  Lawrence poem? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1585.3000000000002s)]
*  D.H. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1586.9s)]
*  Lawrence has this great poem about watching a bird, it's two lines long, drop dead of [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1587.2s)]
*  cold and fall from the bow, dead to the ground, and not feel a moment of self-pity. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1593.2s)]
*  I mean, that is kind of the difference. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1599.6000000000001s)]
*  Right, that's us. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1601.8000000000002s)]
*  I remember one time we hit a deer with a friend and the deer's back broken. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1602.5s)]
*  It just kept running to try to live, right? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1605.3000000000002s)]
*  Whereas a human would immediately think, oh, my life is over. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1608.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1611.7s)]
*  So we have this fatalism in us, something bad happens to us, and we define it in, oh, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1611.9s)]
*  my life is over. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1617.5s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1619.2s)]
*  Your life's in a bad spot, right? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1619.8000000000002s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1621.8000000000002s)]
*  It might suck for a while, but your life is not over, right? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1623.0s)]
*  So then what is that despair? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1627.5s)]
*  So I think when I think about these terms, I think of what is evil or what I think is [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1629.1000000000001s)]
*  demonic, I think in terms of the worst thing you can do as a person is despair. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1633.4s)]
*  Because one, that rejects the divinity of Christ because you're rejecting that you can [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1638.8s)]
*  be saved because if you're despairing, then you're saying that I reject Christ. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1643.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1648.3s)]
*  That's probably, if not the greatest sin, one of the greatest sins because I'm in [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1648.8999999999999s)]
*  despair. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1653.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1654.2s)]
*  Therefore you don't believe Christ can save you. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1654.5s)]
*  You're completely under control of the forces, right? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1657.6s)]
*  The dark forces. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1661.1s)]
*  And then I think of evil in terms of causing human suffering and being anti-human. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1662.4s)]
*  So that's interesting. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1670.1s)]
*  How do you fight? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1672.0s)]
*  I mean, if you've got your head in the internet all day and the civilization that [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1672.8s)]
*  produced you was collapsing and evil is omnipresent and hurting people before [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1676.6s)]
*  your eyes, including people you love, how do you keep from despair? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1682.3s)]
*  Well, because the timelines are different, right? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1686.3s)]
*  In our primitive minds, we think, oh, this is the worst. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1690.1s)]
*  Everything's falling apart. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1694.5s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1695.8s)]
*  We're not even in Bolshevik era. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1696.8s)]
*  We're not even in communist China era under Mao. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1698.6999999999998s)]
*  We're not in the Cambodian genocide. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1701.8999999999999s)]
*  So there's a lot of, and this goes back to maybe why Republicans are so weak. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1703.6999999999998s)]
*  A lot of us have been so psychologically coddled that we view things as being [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1707.8s)]
*  insurmountable problems that we can't solve. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1713.3999999999999s)]
*  I think it was Mao who said that Americans would break if there were ever a war in [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1715.6999999999998s)]
*  America. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1719.1s)]
*  We've never had World War II. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1719.9s)]
*  Everybody was bombed. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1721.6000000000001s)]
*  That was real despair. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1722.8s)]
*  We were the guys over there helping the British bomb people, right? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1724.2s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1727.7s)]
*  In America, we weren't being bombed. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1728.1000000000001s)]
*  We had women had to go work at factories and other things, but it was nothing like [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1729.2s)]
*  Europe and their wars. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1733.4s)]
*  So in America, we're so psychologically coddled that we think, oh, we're like, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1734.7s)]
*  we're losing our country. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1739.5s)]
*  You're always losing your country. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1740.7s)]
*  Time does not stop. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1742.8s)]
*  The world is not static. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1744.5s)]
*  There's always forces being pushed. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1745.5s)]
*  There's always a dialectic. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1746.8s)]
*  There's always good versus evil. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1747.9s)]
*  There's always been lower points in humanity and higher points in humanity. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1749.3s)]
*  So we don't know where we are. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1752.5s)]
*  Even on the cosmic timeline, on God's timeline, on the demons timeline, on the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1753.8999999999999s)]
*  angels timeline, we don't even know where we are, first of all. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1758.1s)]
*  That's mistake number one is that we are in our own mind, God's, and we [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1760.8s)]
*  understand the moment that we're in. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1766.7s)]
*  And we understand that the moment that we're in is so unique and that there's a [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1768.3999999999999s)]
*  narrative arc happening that is either over and we've won because you never win, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1772.6s)]
*  or we're losing and oh my God, we fall into despair. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1778.3999999999999s)]
*  So the problem is I call it like the Marvel, the Marvel movies capture this. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1782.1s)]
*  Well, you don't watch TV or movies and I can't even watch them because [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1786.0s)]
*  they're so formulaic. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1789.6s)]
*  But the idea is here are the people, bad guys come in, destroy things. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1791.3999999999999s)]
*  Hero emerges. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1798.6s)]

*  Good guys kiss the girls. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1803.3s)]
*  The end, right? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1804.6s)]
*  And that's what we love in the American mind. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1806.3s)]
*  But if you looked at it and you zoomed out, not from that simple narrative [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1809.5s)]
*  arc that we love as Americans, you would say, well, now these buildings [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1814.5s)]
*  were blown up. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1816.8s)]
*  People are dying. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1817.6s)]
*  People have lost sons and daughters. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1818.6s)]
*  People are wailing and agony in ways that we can't begin to comprehend. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1820.2s)]
*  And you haven't even won because there'll be another bad guy. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1824.0s)]
*  There'll be another bad guy coming down, right? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1826.8s)]
*  So you have any, what do you mean you've won? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1828.5s)]
*  The good guys won. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1830.0s)]
*  No, the good guys have resolved the conflict in their favor. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1831.2s)]
*  And now you have to rebuild and then you have politics and people [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1836.0s)]
*  fighting as a rebuild. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1838.7s)]
*  Who's going to get the contracts? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1840.1s)]
*  Who's getting ripped off? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1841.6s)]
*  You have all these kids now that you have to watch out for. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1843.1s)]
*  What are you going to do with them? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1845.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1846.6s)]
*  So when you, when you think of it in that way, it can either make you [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1846.9s)]
*  despair more because you feel totally helpless. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1851.3s)]
*  Oh my God, these problems are way worse than I thought. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1853.3s)]
*  Or you realize, ah, we're going through a thing, right? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1855.8s)]
*  We're going through a thing. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1858.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1859.3s)]
*  This is a bad thing. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1859.6s)]
*  We're going through. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1860.3s)]
*  Let's see what we can do about it. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1861.5s)]
*  So there's a, there's a term that I picked up from the, the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1863.1s)]
*  Iowaska kind of people in that little scene. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1867.3999999999999s)]
*  And I think it comes from addiction and they say the only way out is through. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1869.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1874.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1875.0s)]
*  And it sounds sort of glib. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1875.6s)]
*  The only way I was through, what does that even mean? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1877.1999999999998s)]
*  But it means when you're in the shit, you're in the shit, you're in the shit, bro. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1879.8999999999999s)]
*  What do you want me to do? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1884.3s)]
*  You want me to hold your hand? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1885.5s)]
*  You want a milk and cookie? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1886.6999999999998s)]
*  You want a little snuggle? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1888.1999999999998s)]
*  You want a baby bottle? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1889.5s)]
*  You're in the shit, bro. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1890.6s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1891.6s)]
*  Sit there and cry yourself to sleep? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1892.5s)]
*  No, you just keep going. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1894.8s)]
*  The only way out is through, right? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1896.4s)]
*  So when you adopt that as the way you live, doesn't mean you don't have bad [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1897.9s)]
*  days, but you realize, yeah, I'm in the shit. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1902.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1904.1s)]
*  What am I going to do? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1904.7s)]
*  Call mommy, get a little blankie. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1905.7s)]
*  Maybe have a bottle, suck on my thumb a little bit. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1908.0s)]
*  No, you're not going to do that. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1910.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1911.5s)]
*  You just keep pushing through. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1912.1s)]
*  What's the closest you've been to despair? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1913.8s)]
*  The, I mean, I've been in despair. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1917.0s)]
*  And the human rolled over money in hindsight, kind of laughably, small [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1920.0s)]
*  amounts of money, but at the time when you don't have any and you're like, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1923.5s)]
*  I wasn't approved for student loans. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1927.3s)]
*  I got approved for student loans and then I didn't get approved. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1928.7s)]
*  And then I thought I was going to have to drop out of law school because [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1931.9s)]
*  I couldn't get my student loans. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1934.1s)]
*  And now looking back at it, I was like, wow, I was bugging out over that. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1936.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1939.7s)]
*  But at the time that's your whole world. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1940.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1942.6s)]
*  So the smaller you define your world, the bigger your problem seem. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1942.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1946.3s)]
*  So if you want to have less despair to find it. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1946.8s)]
*  The smaller you define your world, the bigger your problem seem. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1948.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1952.3s)]
*  That is wise. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1953.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1953.8s)]
*  So that I look back at that now and I think, oh my God, I was borderline [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1954.0s)]
*  suicidal over just a financial problem. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1958.6s)]
*  You know, like I could have just worked for whatever, right? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1961.3s)]
*  There's a hundred different ways to solve it. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1963.7s)]
*  And so I had a ton of despair there and then I've, I've definitely had [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1966.0s)]
*  despair over despair. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1974.6s)]
*  Maybe it's not the right word, but close to it where we get Trump over [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1978.1999999999998s)]
*  the finish line 2016 and he's going in and all of a sudden the people who [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1981.5s)]
*  got him in there are pushed in the side and all the people who opposed them. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1987.5s)]
*  Take over. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1991.6999999999998s)]
*  What do they say that the people who start revolutions rarely finish them? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1992.6999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1996.1999999999998s)]
*  And I thought we're living this right now. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1996.8s)]
*  And I was bummed, man. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=1998.6s)]
*  I was bummed that we took all these personal risks that we made this [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2000.4s)]
*  happen in impossible feet and all of the people who are never Trump ended [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2007.1000000000001s)]
*  up in the administration ended up staffing things and that made you [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2013.3000000000002s)]
*  feel like despair maybe less of a word than powerless where you're like [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2017.5s)]
*  we did the right thing. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2022.2s)]
*  And sometimes you feel that way with these Republicans. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2023.1000000000001s)]
*  Like we gave you Congress. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2025.6000000000001s)]
*  We gave you Trump. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2027.6000000000001s)]
*  We gave you the White House. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2029.1000000000001s)]
*  We gave you Congress. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2030.5s)]
*  We gave you the Senate and we can't do anything. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2031.5s)]
*  We can't do anything. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2034.7s)]
*  Not nothing is changing, right? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2035.6000000000001s)]
*  Or we get you know, we get the Republicans Congress in this last election [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2038.3000000000002s)]
*  and they still send all the money to Ukraine. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2043.1000000000001s)]
*  And you're thinking what do you what are you guys doing? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2046.4s)]
*  They were confirming all these radical judges and the Senate and they [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2048.5s)]
*  go well Lindsey Graham is rubber stamping all these appointments will [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2052.4s)]
*  block him and committee do something right? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2055.7000000000003s)]
*  So you're in a way you're screaming into the void. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2057.3s)]
*  Like what are we doing? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2061.2000000000003s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2062.6000000000004s)]
*  Why do I have all these gray hairs over this stuff? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2064.3s)]
*  Yeah, and if I but again, that's that's me and my own ego [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2066.9s)]
*  defining the problem small, right? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2071.1000000000004s)]
*  And then that's what defining the world is small as everything is [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2073.7000000000003s)]
*  based on that one issue and then that makes the problem seem bigger [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2077.2000000000003s)]
*  then I just try to zoom out remind myself we're on a longer timeline [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2080.2000000000003s)]
*  or on the timeline of a fin infinity do what we can do. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2083.5s)]

*  that she planned. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2464.6000000000004s)]
*  I think that's absolutely right. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2466.9s)]
*  Voting for Trump stopped that at least for the time being [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2470.2000000000003s)]
*  but you felt despair because you felt that Trump himself [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2474.0s)]
*  was subverted or allowed himself to be subverted by people [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2478.2999999999997s)]
*  who hated him and it made you feel powerless. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2480.3999999999996s)]
*  Demoralized. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2484.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably a continuum. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2485.1s)]
*  So despair would maybe be overstating it but on the [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2487.7s)]
*  continuum, it'd be demoralization and yes and where you [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2491.7s)]
*  think man, I can't believe that I really I can't it's like [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2495.2999999999997s)]
*  if you got your kid a new car and the kid crashed the car [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2499.8999999999996s)]
*  right away while drunk driving. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2502.6s)]
*  You think why brother why right? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2504.5s)]
*  Yeah, why why and there's but that but it had a magnified [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2508.2s)]
*  intensity. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2513.4s)]
*  Yeah, because it was the country most of us. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2513.9s)]
*  Well, actually all of us go through our daily lives using [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2516.5s)]
*  all sorts of quote free technology without paying attention [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2519.1s)]
*  to why it's quote free who's paying for this and how think [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2523.3s)]
*  about it from it. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2527.9s)]
*  Think about your free email account the free messenger [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2528.7s)]
*  system used to chat with your friends the free weather app [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2532.1s)]
*  or game app you open up and never think about it's all free [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2535.9s)]
*  but is it no it's not free. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2540.1s)]
*  These companies aren't developing expensive products [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2543.6s)]
*  and just giving them to you because they love you. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2546.1s)]
*  They're doing it because their programs take all your [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2549.4s)]
*  information. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2551.6s)]
*  They Hoover up your data private personal data and sell [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2552.1s)]
*  it to data brokers and the government and all of those [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2556.2s)]
*  people who are not your friends are very interested in manipulating [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2560.7s)]
*  you and your personal political and financial decisions. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2564.0s)]
*  It's scary as hell and it's happening out in the open [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2567.5s)]
*  without anybody saying anything about it. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2570.5s)]
*  This is a huge problem and we've been talking about this problem [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2573.2s)]
*  to our friend Eric Prince for years. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2576.3999999999996s)]
*  Someone needs to fix this and he and his partners have and [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2578.2s)]
*  now we're partners with them and their company is called [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2581.5s)]
*  unplugged. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2584.0s)]

*  It's a hardware company. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2586.5s)]
*  They actually make a phone. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2588.1s)]

*  a source of your pain also the source of your great joy and [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2853.9s)]
*  love right? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2856.0s)]
*  So if you live in mind and you live in ego you constantly paper [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2856.7999999999997s)]
*  over heart and you think that's because you're strong. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2860.7s)]
*  I'm a real man. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2863.5s)]

*  You're a real man. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2867.1s)]
*  You don't cry. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2867.7s)]

*  That's interesting reaction, right? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2871.6s)]
*  So as you do as you study the more of the mysticism and the [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2873.5s)]
*  real spiritual traditions and how it was practiced then you [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2879.0s)]
*  realize that the heart is his own intelligence and then you're [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2882.7s)]
*  trying to rediscover the intelligence of the heart and [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2885.7s)]
*  once you rediscover the intelligence once you rediscover [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2889.0s)]
*  the intelligence of heart, that's the higher morality. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2891.6s)]
*  The higher morality isn't the words we create the rules. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2895.7s)]
*  We draft out the higher morality is in your heart, but we [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2899.0s)]
*  become so disconnected detached from the heart that that sounds [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2902.2s)]
*  ridiculous or sounds like pussy shit, you know, woo woo pussy [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2905.1s)]
*  shit, right? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2908.4s)]
*  It doesn't I in my hearing anyway, but it does raise the [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2909.3s)]
*  vital question. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2914.3s)]
*  You know what? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2915.3s)]
*  What is good look like you've described evil, but so how do [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2917.4s)]
*  we know that the impulses of our heart are the right impulses? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2920.7s)]
*  Yeah, good is love good as human flourishing good is flowers [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2924.6s)]

*  didn't find the laughter of children satisfying. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2955.2s)]
*  He found it kind of annoying right? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2958.9s)]

*  male ego and that'll just spin you out of control forever. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2997.0s)]
*  And then the heart is man. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=2999.8s)]
*  I kind of snapped on my kid. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3001.9s)]

*  Why did I snap on my kid? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3005.9s)]
*  Oh because I was in that moment. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3007.7s)]
*  The kid was marrying something about myself. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3010.7s)]
*  I don't like that's that's the truest thing right there. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3012.2s)]
*  Will you explain that a little more? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3015.1s)]
*  Well, we then this goes back to even Aristotle why we why we [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3016.5s)]
*  judge and we often judge harshest and others that which [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3021.1s)]
*  we don't like about ourselves, but often weren't denial about [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3024.7000000000003s)]
*  those aspects of ourselves. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3028.2000000000003s)]
*  And so we don't even realize that we're doing it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3029.6s)]
*  We're judging them because we don't like that part of our [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3032.9s)]
*  self and you don't realize no is that part of yourself is [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3034.5s)]
*  broken. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3036.9s)]
*  That's what you want to fix, right? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3037.4s)]
*  Yes, that's what you want to think about and unfortunately [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3039.5s)]
*  people talk about it or it sounds woo-woo or you get down [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3043.0s)]
*  a certain tradition or your well, that's just the most [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3047.0s)]
*  obvious and real thing ever for every parent. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3049.6s)]
*  I mean if you like your wife, I speak for myself. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3051.9s)]
*  I when I see my wife's good qualities reflected in my [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3054.8s)]
*  children. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3057.5s)]
*  I love it when I see my bad qualities reflected in my [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3057.9s)]
*  children drives me crazy. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3060.6s)]
*  Right and then what so what do you take away from that when [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3062.6s)]
*  that happens? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3066.6s)]
*  That you know, I should be more patient and less judgmental [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3068.2000000000003s)]
*  and in fact if a child is displaying one of your ugly [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3072.1000000000004s)]
*  qualities, you know, you know what it's like to struggle [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3074.5s)]
*  with that quality. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3076.9s)]
*  So you should be more compassionate. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3077.5s)]
*  But of course I was speaking for myself. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3079.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm less I hate that right. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3080.6000000000004s)]
*  So I think that some language that I found that was useful [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3083.4s)]
*  and what you're dealing with and deal with and what we'll [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3088.7000000000003s)]
*  always deal with for less of our lives is a lot of our work [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3091.0s)]
*  as parents is closing those loops of childhood trauma or [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3094.5s)]
*  closing the loop of whatever your issue is right because [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3098.8s)]
*  the way we perpetuate momentically are worse parts of [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3101.7s)]
*  ourselves as to raising our children right and what I try [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3105.4s)]
*  to think of is closing the loop and when I see something [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3108.8s)]
*  in my kid that bothers me or triggers something in me. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3112.7s)]
*  I think why is that happening? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3117.2s)]
*  And then I think how can I have that child not continue [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3119.1s)]
*  continue this right? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3123.5s)]
*  How do you how do you break that? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3124.2999999999997s)]
*  How do you break that cycle? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3125.8999999999996s)]
*  And how do you how do you close that loop and I think that [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3127.7s)]
*  becomes a lot more important than getting people locked [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3130.5s)]
*  into office. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3133.2999999999997s)]
*  I think if more of us did that well, how do you do that? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3133.7999999999997s)]
*  You see something ugly in your child that you know comes [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3137.1s)]
*  from you. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3139.7999999999997s)]
*  You've transmitted something either genetically or through [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3140.5s)]
*  conditioning to your child whom you love most in the world [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3143.7999999999997s)]
*  of course that is like bad. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3146.7s)]
*  How do you how do you fix that? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3149.6s)]
*  Well, the more you've learned about yourself the more that [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3151.3999999999996s)]
*  you can transmit the knowledge the kids I'll give you a [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3153.7s)]
*  very basic example of my firstborn has first child energy [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3157.3999999999996s)]

*  that you're closing the loop of a because in my case I didn't [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3231.6s)]
*  I was sort of robbed in my childhood a lot of ways and [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3235.8s)]
*  because I wanted to grow up. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3238.8s)]
*  I don't want to get out of the situation and you realize [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3239.7000000000003s)]
*  now you're letting them be a kid. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3241.8s)]

*  perfect all the time, but you're letting a kid be a kid [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3247.4s)]
*  or another thing first children do is because they have [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3249.7000000000003s)]
*  to look at the well-being of everyone. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3254.0s)]
*  They'll negotiate against themselves, right? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3256.5s)]
*  My daughter. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3259.8s)]
*  I don't know if I'm gonna ask for this dad. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3260.3s)]

*  She's like, I don't know if I should ask for it because I [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3263.5s)]
*  think my other my sister I think once ice cream, but I [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3265.2s)]
*  really want this and I would say well don't negotiate [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3267.7s)]
*  against yourself. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3271.5s)]
*  Ask what you want. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3273.0s)]
*  I can still tell you know, maybe it won't work out but [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3274.1s)]
*  let's close that loop because I noticed that I would negotiate [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3277.6s)]
*  myself against myself sometimes in business dealings and [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3280.5s)]
*  it was something my wife would point out where especially [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3283.6s)]
*  because I was never really like a greedy money-driven person [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3286.7s)]
*  a lot of times I would be more compliant than you would [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3289.8999999999996s)]
*  expect giving my personality. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3293.3999999999996s)]
*  Right giving my personality you might think put a dollar [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3295.2999999999997s)]
*  on the table and he's going to fight me. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3297.5s)]
*  I'm thinking why are we fighting over a dollar? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3299.6s)]
*  This is stupid real. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3300.8999999999996s)]
*  This is dumb. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3302.5s)]
*  But people will take advantage of that, right? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3304.5s)]
*  So I had to learn much later in life. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3306.8999999999996s)]
*  Unfortunately into my 30s and even now in my late 40s. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3309.7999999999997s)]
*  I had to learn no, no, you don't negotiate against yourself. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3313.1s)]
*  Don't worry about them. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3315.6s)]
*  They're worried about themselves. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3316.7s)]
*  They're self-interested actors. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3318.5s)]
*  They're going to try to get as much as they can out of you. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3320.2999999999997s)]

*  You worry about yourself and I realized oh that's first [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3325.1s)]
*  child energy because I was always worried about is everybody [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3328.0s)]

*  So with my firstborn I do want you to negotiate against [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3334.9s)]
*  yourself with the family. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3338.1s)]

*  I want you to think about everybody the family, but I want [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3340.0s)]
*  you to know what you're doing and then have tools to know [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3342.1s)]
*  that when you're going into business or you're doing [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3345.5s)]
*  dealings with other people put that energy aside, right? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3347.3s)]
*  How old is this child? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3351.9s)]
*  Seven and a half. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3353.1s)]
*  Does she understand? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3354.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3355.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3359.0s)]
*  So a lot of my a lot of my virtues, but a lot of my [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3359.3s)]
*  existential dread. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3364.8s)]
*  I had a very a lot of existential dread at a very [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3365.7000000000003s)]
*  young age. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3367.8s)]
*  So one day for example, she was maybe five or six. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3368.4s)]
*  But she was young. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3374.2000000000003s)]
*  I remember she was young and I was waiting for this and [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3374.9s)]
*  hoping it wouldn't happen. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3378.8s)]
*  We were hanging out one day. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3380.2000000000003s)]
*  She was dad. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3381.2000000000003s)]
*  I feel weird. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3382.7000000000003s)]
*  Why do we have bodies? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3383.4s)]
*  I thought oh man. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3385.6s)]
*  Oh no, the genetic whatever spiritual curse or blessing [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3387.0s)]
*  that has been passed on for all of these centuries or [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3392.6s)]
*  millennia is with her because that was very much how I [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3396.7000000000003s)]
*  felt like a kid. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3399.6s)]
*  I felt like this body isn't mine. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3400.2000000000003s)]
*  Why am I here? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3404.0s)]
*  This doesn't make any sense. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3404.9s)]
*  I've always felt alienated from my animalistic materialistic [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3406.5s)]
*  body. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3410.5s)]
*  I've always felt like it was weird that we had bodies. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3411.1s)]
*  I was a gnostic as an early kid. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3415.2000000000003s)]
*  What is this thing that I'm what torture am I being [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3417.0s)]
*  subjected to by having to live in a body right? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3420.4s)]
*  And there is nobody I could talk to about this kind of [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3424.6s)]
*  stuff. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3426.7000000000003s)]

*  Sounds like a nutty thing. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3429.8s)]
*  And I was like, so I told Sean I said, well, she's asking, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3430.6s)]
*  you know, she's asking these kind of questions now, but [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3435.6s)]
*  I'm able to treat them differently. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3438.2s)]
*  Maybe than it would have been when I was a kid or maybe [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3441.2s)]
*  then that I would have been treated when I was a kid. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3443.2999999999997s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3447.1s)]

*  Isn't it? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3449.7s)]
*  What are these things flopping around right? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3450.1s)]
*  It feels weird to be kind of disconnected and alienated [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3453.5s)]
*  from your body and we're here on a spiritual mission. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3456.2999999999997s)]
*  And that's why we're in these bodies where this bodies is [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3461.2999999999997s)]
*  part of the spiritual mission that we've been sent on for [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3463.6s)]
*  since the beginning of time and that we're on a spiritual [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3467.8s)]
*  mission to discover the mystery of the human bodies run [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3469.7000000000003s)]
*  and run a mission to elevate humanity and to elevate [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3473.8s)]
*  the human condition and you have these gifts. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3476.8s)]
*  But along with that comes the responsibility to elevate [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3481.4s)]
*  the human condition to elevate society, but that it is [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3484.7000000000003s)]
*  weird and it's normal to feel you told your seven-year-old [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3488.0s)]
*  she had a an obligation to elevate the human condition [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3490.2000000000003s)]

*  You don't seem tormented by it. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3522.2999999999997s)]
*  How'd you get over that reading a lot of self-help [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3524.3999999999996s)]
*  books and yeah, yeah, nothing. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3527.7s)]
*  Nothing deeper than that realizing that your past isn't [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3530.1s)]
*  what defines you the lowest thing that happened to you [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3533.1s)]
*  is how you define yourself. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3536.0s)]
*  And then that's what brought me into media was the brain [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3537.7999999999997s)]
*  is inherently to the great book on this wire for story. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3541.2s)]

*  Yes, regale ourselves of stories. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3547.1s)]
*  That's how we transmit knowledge. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3549.0s)]
*  But with our own brain that get that gets hijacked because [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3550.2s)]
*  we tell ourselves certain stories and then we often [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3554.8999999999996s)]
*  frame them and the most miserable disempowering way. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3558.2s)]
*  So me I define as the story of my childhood man. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3563.7s)]
*  That was wild and I got out of there alive. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3568.7s)]
*  What a what a trip and you can define it that way or you [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3572.0s)]
*  can define it as here all these things that happen to me. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3576.0s)]
*  I'm garbage. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3579.0s)]
*  I don't matter. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3579.7s)]
*  I'm scum. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3581.3s)]
*  I don't deserve love. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3582.1s)]
*  I don't deserve good things in life. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3583.4s)]
*  And then you can define that as your story. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3585.8s)]
*  And if you define that as your story, that's the path [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3588.1s)]
*  to despair. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3592.4s)]
*  That's the pathway to the practice. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3592.9s)]
*  So you made a conscious decision to see your childhood [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3594.0s)]
*  as this kind of maelstrom that you escaped and feel [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3596.5s)]
*  grateful for that. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3599.9s)]
*  It's this thing that happened to me. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3600.7s)]
*  And then if I want to give into ego, it's a great [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3602.0s)]
*  thing that I overcame or if I want to forgive people [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3605.0s)]
*  and love people I can say my dad worked shitty factory [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3607.9s)]
*  jobs never cheated on my mom never smoked a cigarette [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3610.8s)]
*  never hit us other than the traditional spanking culture [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3614.9s)]
*  that existed at the time never got drunk. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3618.5s)]
*  Not never. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3621.4s)]
*  He never did anything. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3622.2000000000003s)]
*  He did the best that he could with the knowledge that [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3623.8s)]
*  he had and what a sacrifice. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3626.4s)]
*  Did he have and am I grateful enough as a son to to [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3629.4s)]
*  appreciate that to understand what it would be like to [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3634.5s)]
*  be broke. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3636.9s)]
*  To be on welfare a little bit with the shame that a [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3638.0s)]
*  man must feel when he loses a job. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3640.5s)]
*  My goodness. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3642.9s)]
*  What did my dad go through? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3643.5s)]
*  So I got on my own myopia. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3644.4s)]
*  Remember, you know, we always wanted to find the world [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3647.5s)]
*  larger than ourselves. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3650.0s)]
*  The more we focus on ourself the smaller we define the [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3651.2000000000003s)]
*  world than every problem is so big. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3653.7000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3656.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3656.4s)]
*  So then I think oh man, what how hard was that and how [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3657.3s)]
*  how generous was it? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3661.3s)]
*  That my grandparents paid off the mortgage of the house [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3663.5s)]
*  because that was a $200 a month payment, which was a [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3667.7s)]
*  ton of money back then and how different when my [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3670.2s)]
*  childhood had been and how lucky am I that I got out [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3672.7s)]
*  and how many things could have gone wrong in my life [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3677.0s)]
*  and completely all through the course of my life. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3680.5s)]
*  So hey buddy, you're so proud of yourself. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3682.2999999999997s)]
*  You think you're such a great overcomer. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3684.5s)]
*  How much luck was there? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3686.6s)]
*  How much of that was divinely inspired? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3688.6s)]
*  Maybe a little bit of it was maybe you need to get [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3691.3999999999996s)]
*  over yourself. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3693.7s)]
*  Maybe you need to get over your little pity party and [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3694.6s)]
*  realize that things could have gone a lot differently. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3697.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3700.1000000000004s)]
*  So I'm always consciously reframing the story of myself [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3701.1000000000004s)]
*  and the narrative of my life in a way that is that is [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3705.7000000000003s)]
*  zooming out wider and looking at what were other people's [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3709.8s)]
*  problems. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3712.5s)]
*  What were they you doing? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3713.3s)]
*  I mean a friend of mine, you know, you do ayahuasca. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3714.1000000000004s)]
*  He was beat up as a kid and he was you know, he had [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3717.3s)]
*  ayahuasca experience and he saw himself getting beat [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3721.3s)]
*  up as a kid and he saw his dad. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3724.1000000000004s)]
*  But he saw that his dad was beat up as a kid and he was [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3728.1000000000004s)]
*  like, oh my God, my dad was beat up as a kid. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3731.2000000000003s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3734.2000000000003s)]
*  That's why he did it and it doesn't excuse the child [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3734.7000000000003s)]
*  abuse. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3737.8s)]
*  But when you when you zoom out and you realize that [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3739.1000000000004s)]
*  was what has happened, then you don't blame yourself. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3744.2000000000003s)]
*  And then if you don't blame yourself, you can forgive [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3747.5s)]
*  yourself, right? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3749.1000000000004s)]
*  Because it's not that you're unworthy. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3750.4s)]
*  It's not that you don't deserve love. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3752.4s)]
*  It's that that person felt that way and they transmitted [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3755.0s)]
*  that knowledge in a really horrific way. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3757.7000000000003s)]
*  And then you're allowed to forgive them and then you're [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3761.3s)]
*  allowed to move on and you're allowed to to heal yourself [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3763.4s)]
*  because it wasn't really your issue, right? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3766.8s)]
*  And often these realizations are hat is very easy to [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3769.6000000000004s)]
*  talk about like it's nothing but when you're in the [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3773.7000000000003s)]
*  shit when you're in the work, these are not easy conversations [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3776.6000000000004s)]
*  to have with yourself. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3780.1000000000004s)]
*  So I get in the shit and I go into those places and I go [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3781.5s)]
*  into the the darkest experiences that have happened to [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3785.7s)]
*  me and then I do feel that torment. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3788.4s)]
*  I do feel like I'm being attacked and then you know, the [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3791.9s)]
*  only way out is through and you just keep going through [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3795.2999999999997s)]
*  it. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3797.1s)]
*  In a world increasingly defined by deception and the [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3798.2999999999997s)]

*  And not just in this country, but in every white majority [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3829.5s)]
*  country whites are becoming the minority. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3832.4s)]

*  by our leaders sort of openly disparaging them encouraging [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3842.3999999999996s)]
*  them effectively to kill themselves or to want to kill [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3845.8999999999996s)]
*  themselves is overwhelming. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3848.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not saying this is a white man though. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3852.6s)]
*  Obviously I am but it's just it's it's very striking and [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3854.6s)]
*  it's global. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3858.7s)]
*  What is that? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3859.2s)]
*  I had a weird experience when I was in South Africa visiting [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3861.0s)]
*  and in South Africa you have a basically a cell you lock [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3865.5s)]
*  yourself in a cell when you go into apartments you get [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3869.7s)]
*  Airbnb you open the outside cage you go in and then you [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3871.5s)]
*  open another cage to go into the bedroom and then you [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3875.5s)]
*  lock that cage. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3878.2999999999997s)]
*  You have to have all these layers of protection and I [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3879.2s)]
*  remember talking to some white South Africans about that [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3882.6s)]
*  and they go. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3886.7s)]
*  Oh, well, it's just payback for apartheid and they shrugged [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3887.1s)]
*  it off and I said I can understand maybe a little bit [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3890.0s)]
*  looting is payback for apartheid. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3893.9s)]
*  I can understand a little corruption is payback but [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3895.5s)]
*  horrific violent crimes is not a proportionate response [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3898.6s)]
*  to something that people did before you were even born and [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3902.7000000000003s)]
*  ever since then I've been struck with the mystery of this [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3906.1s)]
*  collective racial guilt that white people carry around that [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3910.2000000000003s)]
*  nobody else does if you look at any other ethnic or racial [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3914.3s)]
*  group. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3917.8s)]
*  No one carries around this strange guilt for sins that [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3918.4s)]
*  were committed before you were ever born and I don't [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3922.6s)]
*  understand it. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3925.1s)]
*  I don't understand where that comes from. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3925.7s)]
*  I don't understand the biological basis for the spiritual [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3927.7999999999997s)]
*  basis for it because carrying around collective guilt racial [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3930.2999999999997s)]
*  guilt is actually anti-Christian doesn't make any sense at [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3933.1s)]
*  all and is a it's a knot that I haven't been able to unravel. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3935.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean it does seem like they're disappearing the just [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3941.7s)]
*  like as a numbers matter and even saying that is forbidden [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3945.2999999999997s)]
*  which itself is really revealing. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3950.1s)]
*  I mean if this were true of you know Comanche's or Aleutian [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3951.7s)]
*  Islanders or Han Chinese, you know if they were diminishing [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3956.6s)]
*  in number really strikingly really quickly over a short [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3960.2s)]
*  period of time you'd be like what the hell is going on with [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3962.6s)]
*  Filipinos? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3964.0s)]
*  They're not reproducing everyone hates them. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3965.8999999999996s)]
*  They're dying. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3968.1s)]
*  But even to say that about whites is like somehow bad or [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3970.1s)]
*  something and that tells you that we've all internalized [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3973.2s)]
*  this hate white people thing. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3976.3999999999996s)]
*  You really don't know where that comes from? [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3978.2s)]
*  Well a great example of that is that if you look at gun deaths, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3979.9s)]
*  this is how they they bring the stats on deaths. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3984.7s)]
*  They go oh there's 50,000 gun deaths a year when you look [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3987.2s)]
*  at it. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3989.9s)]
*  It's suicide. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3990.7s)]
*  It's almost exclusively white male suicide via firearm and [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3992.5s)]
*  I always said that if you really cared about gun deaths [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3995.7s)]
*  you would immediately do an intervention into white male [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=3997.9s)]
*  suicide because that is the primary usage of guns. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4000.5s)]
*  Do you know white men have killed themselves personally? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4004.7s)]
*  Not personally. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4007.4s)]
*  I know a friend who had an overdose with opioids so I guess. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4008.1s)]
*  A form of it. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4012.9s)]
*  I know a lot of them. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4013.6s)]
*  Probably I'm several years older than you but I know a lot. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4014.9s)]
*  I know like five at least. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4019.9s)]
*  So yes, that's that's interesting. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4021.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4023.9s)]
*  So if you cared if you cared about gun deaths you would know [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4024.1s)]
*  that the lowest hanging fruit is white male suicide, right? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4028.8s)]
*  You would know that you're not going to confiscate people's [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4032.5s)]
*  guns that would cause social a lack of social cohesion that [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4034.7999999999997s)]
*  none of us even want to think about all that is fake. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4038.3999999999996s)]
*  The real thing you would go after is gang violence and you'd [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4041.7s)]
*  go after white male suicide if you cared if you actually [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4044.5s)]
*  cared about gun deaths you wouldn't point out the occasional [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4046.8999999999996s)]
*  tragic school shooting which is statistically very unlikely [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4050.2s)]
*  even though the horrific when they happen you would say, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4053.3999999999996s)]
*  okay, we have a gun violence problem to solve. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4056.0s)]
*  How are they being used? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4060.3999999999996s)]
*  Okay, most of the people killing each other with them are [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4061.2s)]
*  gang bangers and then you have white males killing themselves. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4065.0s)]
*  Let's do an immediate. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4068.5s)]
*  I mean, it's it's laughable to imagine this happening in a [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4070.3999999999996s)]
*  world that were logical and not driven by hatred. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4073.6s)]
*  You would see all kinds of interventions public service [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4079.2999999999997s)]
*  announcements happening about white male suicide. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4083.0s)]
*  It would be one of the biggest issues people talked about you [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4086.0s)]
*  would say did you have any idea most people don't most people [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4088.2999999999997s)]
*  think you're lying about the stats when you tell them. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4091.0s)]
*  Oh, no half half of the gun deaths that they bring up our [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4092.7s)]
*  suicide and white men are 3.5 times more likely to kill [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4095.4s)]
*  themselves than anyone else and people with that can't be [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4098.3s)]
*  true. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4100.9s)]
*  Like well, you can go black women are the most oppressed [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4101.2s)]
*  group in the United States. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4103.1s)]
*  That is a an article of faith for everybody. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4104.0s)]
*  We hear that every literally every day, but the suicide rate [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4106.7s)]
*  among black women is like negligible. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4110.6s)]
*  Well, nobody yet nobody's ever been able to square the circle [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4112.6s)]
*  of how media imaging suppresses the self-esteem of black [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4115.7s)]
*  Americans who have almost no suicide, but it's building up [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4121.1s)]
*  the white self-esteem within the whites of the ones killing [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4126.900000000001s)]
*  themselves, right? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4130.1s)]
*  There's no there's no logic right? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4131.200000000001s)]
*  So it's so I guess that's kind of my point is not to whine [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4132.8s)]
*  about it because I hate whining about anything completely [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4135.3s)]
*  about race. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4137.900000000001s)]
*  However, it's so illogical. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4139.200000000001s)]
*  It's so like absurd that it suggests that there's something [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4141.400000000001s)]
*  deeper going on which is people are kind of happy when whites [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4144.8s)]
*  die and that's obviously true. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4147.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a deep hatred that there's a deep hatred. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4148.900000000001s)]
*  And it would just be it would be a lot easier if I weren't [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4151.1s)]
*  white to to note this because you're a white supremacist [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4154.400000000001s)]
*  if you noted but even that it's like stop complaining about [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4157.400000000001s)]
*  people dying because if you complain about it, you're evil [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4161.0s)]
*  or something like that whole formulation is so sick. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4163.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're they the framing is not only you can't talk [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4168.8s)]
*  about it, but if you talk about it, then you'll be labeled [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4172.0s)]
*  a white nationalist. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4174.900000000001s)]
*  The white supremacist. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4176.0s)]
*  You're thinking bro. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4177.3s)]
*  I'm talking about suicide. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4177.900000000001s)]
*  I thought you wanted fewer gun deaths, right? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4179.3s)]
*  You're telling me that you want fewer gun deaths and I'm [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4181.900000000001s)]
*  telling you here's a way to do that. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4184.900000000001s)]
*  And now you're saying no, that's actually racist to say [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4188.0s)]
*  that that's a way to say, but where does it come from? [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4191.0s)]
*  I guess that's my question is where does that impulse come [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4192.8s)]
*  from? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4194.900000000001s)]
*  Is it is it envy? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4195.2s)]
*  I mean white men have, you know, created a lot the overwhelming [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4197.3s)]
*  majority of technological advances, for example, in the [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4200.6s)]
*  20th century, you know, electricity the airplane, etc. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4202.7s)]
*  Is it that that makes people angry? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4206.900000000001s)]
*  Is it is there something spiritual going on? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4209.1s)]
*  Like what is this and it does seem to be helpful to [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4211.1s)]
*  acknowledge that this is absolutely real. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4213.700000000001s)]
*  The numbers show it the mass migration around the world [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4215.400000000001s)]
*  into majority white countries to make them minority white [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4219.1s)]
*  countries clearly driven by hate obviously. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4222.0s)]
*  But where's that hate come from? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4225.6s)]
*  What is that the ethnic groups have always hate each other [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4227.6s)]
*  like the Rwandan genocide for me was always a hard thing [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4230.400000000001s)]
*  to wrap my Americanized brain around. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4233.200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4236.400000000001s)]
*  Because if you're American your whole world is there's [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4236.7s)]
*  white people black people and once you go there. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4239.5s)]
*  No, no, they know it's so true. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4242.5s)]
*  The Cambodians hate the Vietnamese and the ties and [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4243.9s)]
*  Vietnamese hate each other. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4246.9s)]
*  I remember everyone hates the Chinese. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4248.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and then the Han Chinese hate the other Chinese [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4250.0s)]
*  right? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4253.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4254.099999999999s)]
*  So anywhere you look there's always been ethnic strife [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4254.5s)]
*  and I think that that's why the agenda the anti-human [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4258.2s)]
*  agenda is to just cram as many different people together [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4263.5s)]
*  as they possibly can knowing that this will create some [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4266.6s)]
*  kind of strife. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4270.1s)]
*  So there can't be there can't be order right? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4271.0s)]
*  So if you look at yes, I look at it again real or metaphorically [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4273.1s)]
*  demons are chaos God has logos God is order. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4278.400000000001s)]
*  Yes, right. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4281.400000000001s)]
*  So when you look at forces driving chaos, then you can [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4282.3s)]
*  usually say that's the anti-human that's the demonic [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4286.400000000001s)]
*  element because again the demons don't care who comes [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4289.5s)]
*  up ahead if the demons could somehow inside a race war. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4291.8s)]
*  They don't care what side wins. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4295.0s)]
*  They only care that a lot of people kill each other that [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4297.0s)]
*  there's a lot of despair that there's a lot of suffering [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4299.5s)]
*  that they can harvest a lot of that negative energy. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4301.900000000001s)]
*  That's all they care about. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4304.1s)]
*  So then when we talk about these issues for me is always [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4305.8s)]
*  challenging because one you don't want to make people feel [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4308.8s)]
*  persecuted. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4312.3s)]
*  You don't want to miss exactly right. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4313.400000000001s)]
*  Yes, I totally agree. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4314.900000000001s)]
*  Can we just pause for a second? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4316.3s)]
*  I've struggled with this a lot as I've watched the anti-white [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4317.6s)]
*  hate kind of define our country and destroy a lot of people. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4320.1s)]
*  I know it's hard to talk about not because I care about [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4323.6s)]
*  being called a racist. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4327.0s)]
*  I'm not a racist. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4327.700000000001s)]
*  I don't care if they call me that but because I don't want [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4328.3s)]
*  to inspire self-pity or a sense of persecution people [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4331.400000000001s)]
*  because it's really bad for people. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4334.3s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4336.0s)]
*  Right and then it can add to the tribalism. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4337.1s)]
*  Well, totally which we don't want. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4339.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want white men thinking. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4341.6s)]
*  Oh boy, they're out to get us and now I agree. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4343.6s)]
*  So a lot of times you throw your hand up and you're [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4346.200000000001s)]
*  thinking how do I even how do you handle these issues? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4348.0s)]
*  How do you address it? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4349.700000000001s)]
*  Yes, it is an issue opioid overdose deaths are an issue [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4350.3s)]
*  and the way that I try to address it in a spiritual way [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4353.3s)]
*  is I try to focus on a general aspirational message. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4359.3s)]
*  So I get into the weeds on politics. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4364.0s)]
*  I get in the mud. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4366.400000000001s)]
*  I'm not claiming to be some great guru or whatever, but [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4367.700000000001s)]
*  I always if you read me long enough, you know that I [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4371.3s)]
*  generally speaking believe that if you decide to not be [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4374.1s)]
*  a loser, you can live a good life. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4377.8s)]
*  You're not going to maybe live your dream life. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4380.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4382.200000000001s)]
*  You're not going to be in the Yankees. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4382.5s)]
*  I was never on the Yankees. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4384.0s)]
*  I'm not Alex Rodriguez. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4386.1s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4387.5s)]
*  You can you can just accept that you're not going to be [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4388.2s)]
*  that but if you decide, you know what? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4390.8s)]
*  I just don't want to be some pathetic loser angry all day [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4392.6s)]
*  about politics getting fat with my mom who has enabled [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4395.3s)]
*  this behavior. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4399.6s)]
*  It's true. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4400.6s)]
*  And if you read me long enough, you know, like I believe [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4401.1s)]
*  in you. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4403.1s)]
*  I don't think I'm not going to sell you a lie and tell [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4403.5s)]
*  you that you're going to be anything that you can want [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4405.8s)]
*  to be because that isn't the way embodiment works, but [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4408.0s)]
*  you can live a good life and there's a lot to be said [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4411.6s)]
*  for just living a good life, right? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4413.900000000001s)]
*  There's a lot to be said for living a nice normal life. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4415.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4419.200000000001s)]
*  And so for me instead of focusing on a lot of the [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4419.8s)]
*  tension issues, I do point them out and identify them. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4423.6s)]
*  But it's always about look man, it starts with you. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4426.8s)]
*  The system is rigged. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4430.900000000001s)]
*  My dad didn't get a job because of affirmative action [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4431.900000000001s)]
*  a state police job that was proven when there was a [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4434.3s)]
*  class action settlement. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4436.1s)]
*  I can point to real things that have happened racialized [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4437.3s)]
*  issues where we were on the receiving end of the [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4440.8s)]
*  oppression. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4443.2s)]
*  But if that's all you think about is the world is [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4444.900000000001s)]
*  rigged. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4447.3s)]
*  I can't really do anything. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4447.6s)]
*  Now you're given into despair. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4448.7s)]
*  The world is rigged. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4450.2s)]
*  It's always been rigged bro. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4450.900000000001s)]
*  World War one, you're going to get drafted and thrown [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4452.6s)]
*  in to fight in Europe and the trenches because the [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4454.900000000001s)]
*  French and English can't get along and the Germans and [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4458.5s)]
*  the Australian Hungarians are beefing again because [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4460.7s)]
*  the European, right? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4464.3s)]
*  So the timeline is always helpful to at the micro [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4466.4s)]
*  level at the micro level you think and this is the [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4470.5s)]
*  message I kind of always teach is usually directed [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4473.7s)]
*  towards men is there are a lot of people who are [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4475.7s)]
*  despair mongers and they want you to think that all [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4479.7s)]
*  women are terrible. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4482.5s)]
*  You're a white man. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4483.9s)]
*  You're oppressed. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4484.7s)]
*  Nothing you do matters. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4485.7s)]
*  Everything is your you're an oppressor or you're an [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4486.9s)]
*  oppressor feel guilty about that. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4489.0s)]
*  There's a whole different way to spin it. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4491.0s)]
*  Whereas I just start from the proposition. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4492.599999999999s)]
*  Hey just decide you don't want to be a loser and [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4494.4s)]
*  take the first step. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4496.3s)]
*  So let's let's get specific. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4497.3s)]
*  I love the way you're seeing this because you're [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4499.4s)]
*  absolutely right. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4503.099999999999s)]
*  I think it's fair to acknowledge what's actually [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4505.4s)]
*  happening. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4507.2s)]
*  I don't think you should ever lie. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4507.8s)]
*  It diminishes you to lie lying is evil. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4510.0s)]
*  On the other hand marinating in it clearly doesn't [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4513.4s)]
*  help. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4515.7s)]
*  So you're a 19 year old American man. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4516.099999999999s)]
*  A lot of things are factually speaking stacked [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4520.599999999999s)]
*  against you. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4522.8s)]
*  But you don't want to be a loser and be mad about [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4523.8s)]
*  politics and fat and living with your mom. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4525.8s)]
*  I see so nicely described. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4527.5s)]
*  What do you do and what do you avoid? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4530.5s)]
*  Yeah, the biggest thing you want to avoid is that [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4532.900000000001s)]
*  enabling pattern of behavior because most of [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4535.400000000001s)]
*  these guys didn't have a dad figure or their dad [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4538.400000000001s)]
*  was kind of some cucked checked out guy. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4542.1s)]
*  And so as bad as my childhood was a lot of ways [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4544.8s)]
*  my dad did make me take martial arts when I was [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4547.1s)]
*  getting bullied. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4549.1s)]
*  He did say like well, I mean you're getting [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4550.0s)]
*  bullied you got to like do martial arts and it [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4552.4s)]
*  was just very matter of fact that was because that [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4554.7s)]
*  was the old school kind of masculine thing which [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4557.7s)]
*  is I mean you're a chubby kid. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4559.5s)]
*  You're getting picked on you got to learn how to [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4561.4s)]
*  fight and it's going to have to fight people and [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4563.2s)]
*  that's just the way it's going to be. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4565.0s)]
*  Yes, that's what I was told. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4566.0s)]
*  Whereas the mom the feminine wants to nurture [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4567.4s)]
*  right, which is good. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4570.599999999999s)]
*  But then that also enables so everything if you [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4571.4s)]
*  look at things energetically the masculine draws [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4573.7s)]
*  boundaries, but then it can become too harsh and [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4576.599999999999s)]
*  unforgiving right? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4578.599999999999s)]
*  And that's why God has man and woman. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4579.799999999999s)]
*  But the woman will enable oh baby boy. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4581.7s)]
*  Oh, you're sad. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4585.3s)]
*  Oh, let me give you some ice cream. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4586.8s)]
*  Oh, no, you have a bad day, right? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4588.4s)]
*  And you see you have to have that duality of [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4590.7s)]
*  energy that struggle that creates a complete [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4592.6s)]
*  person or a whole person. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4595.6s)]
*  So if you're 19, you would just want to have a [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4597.2s)]
*  you everything starts with you with a piece of [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4601.4s)]
*  paper and a pen and you're just assessing where [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4604.3s)]
*  your life is right and you're asking yourself. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4607.5s)]
*  I don't know was I enabled by a overly nurturing [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4611.1s)]
*  mother maybe maybe not maybe your problems [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4614.900000000001s)]
*  different. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4617.400000000001s)]
*  Maybe your dad was a dick and he give you love [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4617.6s)]
*  and so now you struggle with love and you're [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4619.6s)]
*  you're too harsh right? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=4622.200000000001s)]

*  That's the worst thing in the world for the demons [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5585.2s)]
*  because that's how they lose you. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5588.400000000001s)]
*  They want to they want to drag you down into the [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5590.1s)]
*  muck as much as they can and take you as low as [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5592.3s)]
*  they can because then you feel like you can't be [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5595.1s)]
*  reached. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5598.700000000001s)]
*  You can't be helped. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5599.1s)]
*  You've gone too far. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5600.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5601.1s)]
*  So you once you realize the spiritual component of [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5602.200000000001s)]
*  it to you think you motherfucker. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5604.400000000001s)]
*  I know what you're doing. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5606.0s)]
*  You know, they give you a wandering eye. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5607.3s)]
*  So it would it be fair to say according to this [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5609.1s)]
*  principle that if something doesn't satisfy you [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5613.700000000001s)]
*  that is bad. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5617.1s)]
*  If it doesn't satiate, you're probably leaving the [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5618.6s)]
*  realm of the spiritual space that you want to [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5622.9s)]
*  occupy if it's not satiating, right? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5627.099999999999s)]
*  And for other people struggle with different things [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5630.099999999999s)]
*  for some people it can be food for some people can [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5633.2s)]
*  be drugs, sex, opioid. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5635.5s)]
*  Yes, sex, right. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5637.4s)]
*  So any kind of sex that doesn't satiate you doesn't [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5638.5s)]
*  satisfy you probably not the sex you should be having [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5642.799999999999s)]
*  it's probably leading you down the bad path. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5645.7s)]
*  Do you think people are becoming more spiritually [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5647.299999999999s)]
*  aware in the United States? [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5648.9s)]
*  I think that more conversations are being had as [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5650.7s)]
*  more as more people who are friends or not French [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5656.099999999999s)]
*  open these conversations. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5660.4s)]
*  So I think about it in two ways. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5661.4s)]
*  One is I know that in my spiritual awakening such as [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5665.2s)]
*  it is which I'm still baby in terms of the cosmic [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5669.299999999999s)]
*  timeline is I said, you know, I never believe in [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5672.4s)]
*  God, but you guys showed me the devil is real. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5675.2s)]
*  Right? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5677.7s)]
*  I felt the same way. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5678.099999999999s)]
*  So something's up, bro. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5679.3s)]
*  I don't know what exactly right. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5680.4s)]
*  I don't Jesus Christ is the son of God and he [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5681.6s)]
*  returned. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5683.5s)]
*  He's a Messiah and that's your only path to salvation [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5683.9s)]
*  and that it added added added. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5686.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5687.5s)]
*  Okay, we can have that never that never called to [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5688.2s)]
*  me. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5693.5s)]
*  That was never where I said, okay, I believe in God [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5693.8s)]
*  and this is the truth by go. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5695.8s)]
*  Oh, the evil is so over. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5697.5s)]
*  Obviously, yes, I've been blinded spiritually for [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5699.1s)]
*  some reason. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5701.9s)]
*  So obviously there's something else going on here [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5702.6s)]
*  that isn't really good that that is so precisely [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5705.7s)]
*  what happened to me that I wonder how many other [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5708.3s)]
*  people that's happened to a and B. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5710.3s)]
*  I wonder if the existence or the overt nature of [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5712.400000000001s)]
*  evil isn't a kind of blessing. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5715.6s)]
*  Well, I mean if you go in the spirit world, they [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5717.900000000001s)]
*  tell you can't have light without dark. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5720.2s)]
*  That's one of the principles against the spirit [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5722.0s)]
*  world is you can't have light without dark and [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5725.400000000001s)]
*  darkness brings people to light. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5727.900000000001s)]
*  And if you really do believe in God then and you [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5729.2s)]
*  do really believe in the infinite you realize that [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5732.8s)]
*  everybody's kind of kind of has a different path to [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5735.3s)]
*  to the light. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5738.900000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe a better way to put it would be God uses [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5739.7s)]
*  evil to draw people to himself or he lets or it's [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5741.8s)]
*  just what CS Lewis and all the Christian apologetics [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5746.400000000001s)]
*  say, which is that he gave us free will and the [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5749.2s)]
*  table was cast but on the timeline of God what might [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5752.6s)]
*  seem like insurmountable suffering to us is [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5755.6s)]
*  completely different. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5757.400000000001s)]
*  So we don't really know on this world what it means. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5758.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5762.1s)]
*  We could say well, you know, for example, one of the [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5762.8s)]
*  big perplexing problems is the problem of evil. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5764.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5767.8s)]
*  The problem of evil. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5768.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5769.3s)]
*  And I would say having ventured through the spirit [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5770.200000000001s)]
*  world is that to us is a problem we should talk [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5772.700000000001s)]
*  about philosophically but on the spiritual realm the [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5777.1s)]
*  timeline is so different that the way it would the [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5779.6s)]
*  way it would even out by God is incomprehensible to [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5783.5s)]
*  our minds. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5786.900000000001s)]
*  So what we think is why does God allow evil you say [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5787.3s)]
*  well because God's on the infinite timeline and what [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5789.900000000001s)]
*  we perceive evil is over in a flash and that there's [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5791.5s)]
*  a sanctification process and people rejoin God. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5794.2s)]
*  So we're fighting over this only because we don't [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5797.0s)]
*  understand the spirit world and we don't understand [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5798.9s)]
*  the infinite timelines of play. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5801.099999999999s)]
*  So because of that what we're kind of fussing over [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5802.5s)]
*  is philosophically distracting us from ourselves. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5805.8s)]
*  So rather than get into the apologetics, why does [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5808.4s)]
*  God allow evil and it's because free will we're [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5811.2s)]
*  still in mind, right? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5812.9s)]
*  We're still in mind in heart. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5815.2s)]
*  You say what am I doing to sanctify my heart is my [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5817.0s)]
*  heart full of lust pride evilness. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5819.9s)]
*  Did I lose my temper today? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5823.4s)]
*  Right? [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5825.299999999999s)]
*  Am I getting greedy? [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5825.599999999999s)]
*  Am I trying to take advantage in a business deal? [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5827.299999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5829.7s)]
*  What am I doing to sanctify my heart? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5829.9s)]
*  So a lot of these intellectual discussions which [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5831.2s)]
*  are valuable to have and I've read all the books. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5833.5s)]
*  It's still a distractions the ego's way of distracting [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5836.299999999999s)]
*  from the heart. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5838.7s)]
*  So everything about this whole mind fuck world is [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5839.5s)]
*  the ego keeping you away from your heart. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5842.9s)]
*  So what I try to focus on as much is reawakening the [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5845.299999999999s)]
*  mind the full consciousness of the human heart in [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5849.2s)]
*  my own human heart. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5851.799999999999s)]
*  What are the disciplines that you use to to achieve [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5852.7s)]
*  that? [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5855.099999999999s)]
*  Well, I say that Jesus prayer a lot because I think [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5856.2s)]
*  it's very humbling, you know, Jesus Christ son of [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5858.099999999999s)]
*  God have mercy on me a sinner and that's the [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5860.5s)]
*  entirety of the prayer. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5863.7s)]
*  They're called arrow prayers quiver prayers because [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5865.0s)]
*  people overthink prayers, right? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5867.0s)]
*  Oh, what do I say in my prayers? [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5869.2s)]
*  What do I say? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5871.2s)]
*  Well, there's books, you know, can you repeat that? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5871.599999999999s)]
*  Yes, Jesus Christ son of God have mercy on me a [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5874.099999999999s)]
*  sinner and the reason that that has a certain impact [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5877.0s)]
*  on people is because it's a reminder that you do [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5882.3s)]
*  you do need Divine Mercy is a reminder of your ego [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5885.400000000001s)]
*  thinking you're such hot shit and you're so important [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5889.5s)]
*  and you're so great. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5892.900000000001s)]
*  You're such a great man of history, right? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5893.7s)]
*  You're so important, right? [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5896.6s)]
*  You know, cuz me I struggle with pride. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5898.400000000001s)]
*  Everybody has a difference in the struggle with I [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5900.400000000001s)]
*  don't struggle with sloth. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5902.3s)]
*  I'm proud. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5904.1s)]
*  I'm ambitious right within the flip side of that as [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5904.5s)]
*  price and I struggle with pride. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5907.0s)]
*  So then you're reminding yourself. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5908.7s)]
*  I need the Divine Mercy of I need the Divine Mercy [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5910.0s)]
*  of God. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5912.7s)]
*  I need the Divine Mercy of Christ and having again [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5913.4s)]
*  it seen it through the veil. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5916.4s)]
*  You realize how inconsequential our troubles are. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5917.8s)]
*  So for me that's just I do that all the time and [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5922.7s)]
*  especially before bed. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5924.7s)]
*  I'm just reminding myself. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5925.5s)]
*  Okay, I need have mercy on me a sinner and not in a [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5926.4s)]
*  judgmental way, but just you know, what have I done? [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5929.7s)]
*  And then as you do that get more reps in you can [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5931.8s)]
*  catch yourself more because it's all about catching [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5935.4s)]
*  yourself early on right? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5937.3s)]
*  Like your kid gets mad and the kids are bickering [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5938.8s)]
*  and they're fighting and you're about to like lose [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5941.900000000001s)]
*  it. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5944.5s)]
*  What the fuck, you know, why are my kids fighting [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5944.900000000001s)]
*  or whatever? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5946.7s)]
*  It helps ground you right helps remind you you need [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5948.1s)]
*  mercy in this moment because you're weak. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5951.1s)]
*  Otherwise you wouldn't care your kids are bickering [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5952.400000000001s)]
*  kids are kids they bicker who gives a shit right? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5954.2s)]
*  Well, I care because my ego tells me that there [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5957.900000000001s)]
*  should be more order or they're disturbing my train [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5960.8s)]
*  of thought or whatever whatever bullshit my ego [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5963.400000000001s)]
*  has got me wrapped up in. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5965.8s)]
*  So then you remind myself not mean I do need mercy [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5967.0s)]
*  because what a pathetic creature I am losing my [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5968.7s)]
*  temper because kids are bickering because kids are [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5971.3s)]
*  being kids right? [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5973.3s)]
*  Like wow, I'm pathetic. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5974.3s)]
*  Actually, I think I'm so great, but this is pathetic. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5975.5s)]
*  What a pitiful human being you are right? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5978.0s)]
*  But you were so but you remind yourself that's why [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5981.5s)]
*  you need the divine grace and divine love. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5983.099999999999s)]
*  So we each have four kids. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5986.599999999999s)]
*  My oldest is like 30 years older than your youngest. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5989.4s)]
*  So I'm done with with the things that you're doing [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5992.099999999999s)]
*  now and I often think to myself and say to my wife [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5995.9s)]
*  man, am I glad we're not doing that now? [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=5997.8s)]
*  We don't have little kids now in this world because [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6000.3s)]
*  it's so hostile to children. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6002.3s)]
*  I mean, it's like overtly hostile to children. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6003.6s)]
*  How how do you how do you do that? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6006.400000000001s)]
*  How do you raise children right now thoughtfully to [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6010.2s)]
*  become the kind of people you want them to be? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6013.3s)]
*  I don't know that I don't know at least in my own [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6015.7s)]
*  experiences that the world is hostile to kids. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6019.3s)]
*  I think that that wave is passed but that's still [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6023.400000000001s)]
*  within the media. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6025.400000000001s)]
*  The media world the DC world what I'm seeing now is [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6027.3s)]
*  a resurgence of very involved dads and very [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6030.3s)]
*  involved parents and there's probably a split where [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6033.0s)]
*  a lot of kids are getting left behind. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6035.3s)]
*  But I would say I'm seeing way more parents who [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6037.5s)]
*  who are like way way more involved in parenting [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6040.0s)]
*  than my parents were probably than yours. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6043.8s)]
*  I guess no I'd be more precise pushing weird [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6045.7s)]
*  sex shit on kids, which when I was a kid would [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6048.6s)]
*  have been cause for gunfire. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6051.6s)]
*  Now it just seems everywhere. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6053.599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6055.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6056.099999999999s)]
*  So the resisting the worldly temptations are what [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6056.4s)]
*  we went through to and didn't realize it. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6061.7s)]
*  Britney Spears on the TV. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6063.3s)]
*  No, that's right. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6064.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6065.599999999999s)]
*  We've had different spiritual fights. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6065.9s)]
*  We just didn't maybe realize that we are being [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6068.0s)]
*  groomed. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6070.099999999999s)]
*  That's why I say we were groomed. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6070.8s)]
*  You were groomed. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6073.2s)]
*  I was groomed. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6073.8s)]
*  Everybody raised on Girls Gone Wild was groomed. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6074.3s)]
*  Everybody raised on Show Me Your Tits a song. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6076.8s)]
*  You and me baby ain't nothing but animals. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6080.2s)]
*  Let's do it like they do in the Discovery Channel. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6082.6s)]
*  Very popular song when I was in high school. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6084.9s)]
*  Realizing the music was programming you for [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6087.2s)]
*  fornication for violence for drugs. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6089.6s)]
*  We were groomed as bad or worse than the kids were [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6092.2s)]
*  now. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6094.0s)]
*  It just it finally resonated to us in a way that [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6094.9s)]
*  clicks our constructs on maybe what what's too far. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6097.8s)]
*  But we were groomed terribly. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6101.8s)]
*  We just didn't realize it. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6103.8s)]
*  Huh? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6104.7s)]
*  That's a that's a wise point. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6105.3s)]
*  And actually there's something kind of comforting [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6107.4s)]
*  about drag times drag Queen story hour. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6108.8s)]
*  I mean it's people pissing on each other during [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6112.3s)]
*  Pride March in San Francisco. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6114.4s)]
*  It's like it's so in your face that you know what [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6115.5s)]
*  it is. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6118.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6118.8s)]
*  So there's there's a new resurgence happening as a [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6119.1s)]
*  result of that and the spiritual conflict goes on [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6123.1s)]
*  forever. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6126.9s)]
*  It does it doesn't end. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6127.5s)]
*  So what we do personally is we're very much concerned [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6128.8s)]
*  about the bubble. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6133.1s)]
*  Anybody who tells your kids anybody who tells you [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6135.7s)]
*  don't show it to your kids groomer show through [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6137.6s)]
*  your kids. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6140.4s)]
*  Why do you want me why you tell me not to show to [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6141.2s)]
*  my kids don't lock your doors at night really. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6143.0s)]
*  Okay, you're you're an armed robber. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6146.9s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6148.7s)]
*  Don't show through my kids. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6149.4s)]
*  Okay, you know, there's a big shelter, but there's [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6150.9s)]
*  a shelter. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6154.3s)]
*  Yeah, and your kids should have shelter. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6155.1s)]
*  It's how you do it. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6157.2s)]
*  Of course. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6158.2s)]
*  And everybody's really concerned about peer groups [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6159.0s)]
*  for us. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6163.0s)]
*  The bigger wars are over screen time and how how [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6163.7s)]
*  much should kids be allowed to watch TV devices, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6166.6s)]
*  especially handheld devices, which you try to [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6170.0s)]
*  limit, but then you're on a flight and you give [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6171.8s)]
*  the kid iPad. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6173.4s)]
*  So those are the bigger struggles. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6174.5s)]
*  What's unfortunate is that the trans mania is [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6176.7s)]
*  primarily hitting the poor people, right? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6182.7s)]
*  The people who don't have a lot of time who are [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6186.7s)]
*  very tired who are very stressed and they kind [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6189.2s)]
*  of raise their kids on default, right? [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6192.0s)]
*  So if you imagine that it takes a certain amount [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6193.7s)]
*  of leisure time to be politically informed, [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6197.0s)]
*  right? [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6199.599999999999s)]
*  Aristotle even said you shouldn't be involved in [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6199.8s)]
*  politics until you're 35 because you by that point, [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6201.599999999999s)]
*  maybe you have some leisure time. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6205.2s)]
*  But before that you need to live your life and have [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6206.3s)]
*  some kind of achievement, right? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6208.599999999999s)]
*  So if you're if you're an intact family, which is [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6210.599999999999s)]
*  becoming more rare, dad and mom both work. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6213.7s)]
*  They come home tired process food diet because [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6217.7s)]
*  we've transitioned away from where when I grew up [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6221.099999999999s)]
*  we call it people finding defensive. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6224.5s)]
*  Now I didn't find it offensive, but you call it [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6226.2s)]
*  peasant food or poverty food. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6228.0s)]
*  We ate beans, ham hocks and beans, right? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6229.7s)]
*  Chicken and dumplings. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6233.8s)]
*  You would eat things that were cooked. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6235.4s)]
*  You would often cook at home. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6238.4s)]
*  Even if you're poor, you can afford to cook and [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6239.4s)]
*  now everybody's raised on processed foods and [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6241.3s)]
*  that's having a lot of problems with some people [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6243.1s)]
*  claim seed oils are the problem. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6246.8s)]
*  But whatever the case is, we know that there's a [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6248.1s)]
*  problem with diet. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6249.6s)]
*  That's how long health effects, right? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6250.8s)]
*  So you eat you are you wake up you get wound up on [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6252.0s)]
*  a donut coffee. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6255.3s)]
*  You work a little bit monster energy drink a lunch [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6257.0s)]
*  of processed food by the time you get home. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6260.1s)]
*  You're exhausted, right? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6262.6s)]
*  There's your kids and you entrusted your kids to [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6264.0s)]
*  the school and you don't have all the time in the [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6266.1s)]
*  world to to figure out best parenting practices, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6268.8s)]
*  right? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6273.6s)]
*  You're beat down man. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6273.8s)]
*  You're just trying to make it. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6275.2s)]
*  You're trying to keep your head above water. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6276.2s)]
*  So the tragedy is that and it is hitting the rich [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6278.1s)]
*  kids too, because I do have a side point on that. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6281.0s)]
*  The tragedy is that this really was hitting the [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6283.0s)]
*  poor kids first. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6285.8s)]
*  So if you go into the training stuff, yeah, if [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6287.2s)]
*  you go through any small town, I saw the gender [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6289.400000000001s)]
*  bending stuff happening in all these small towns [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6291.2s)]
*  on any kind of small town road trip and then it [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6294.5s)]
*  percolated up to elite opinion and then so did the [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6296.6s)]
*  opioids. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6299.5s)]
*  So remember Susan the CEO of YouTube who banned [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6300.0s)]
*  conservatives her kid died of overdose opioids and [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6303.8s)]
*  her world because she banned people like me and [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6306.8s)]
*  sensor people like me who were anti that the people [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6309.400000000001s)]
*  the forces that were working against those [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6312.3s)]
*  compounds that in their mind. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6314.6s)]
*  Oh, it can't happen to me. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6316.6s)]
*  We're the elite. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6318.400000000001s)]
*  No, you're not dude. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6319.8s)]
*  And she I was wondering if she have self-awareness [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6320.700000000001s)]
*  like what she feels at night in a moment of [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6323.6s)]
*  self-awareness realizing that she created the [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6326.8s)]
*  culture to kill their son. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6329.6s)]
*  If we're being completely honest, and I don't [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6331.1s)]
*  mind saying that this is the truth. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6332.400000000001s)]
*  She created that culture of the open borders. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6334.200000000001s)]
*  The drugs coming in block everybody who's against [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6336.8s)]
*  the open borders call people who are anti-drug [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6339.3s)]
*  kooks. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6342.3s)]
*  Oh reefer madness, bro, right all of that [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6342.7s)]
*  degeneracy has hit the elite now. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6345.2s)]
*  So they thought this is going to be some something [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6348.1s)]
*  happened to poor white trash to use their terms [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6350.2s)]
*  not mine. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6352.5s)]
*  They're oh whatever who cares about them and now [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6353.6s)]
*  they're realizing they're not immune to their kids [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6356.3s)]
*  are gender-bending now their kids are on opioids [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6358.400000000001s)]
*  now their kids are doing only fans their kids are [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6360.400000000001s)]
*  addicted to pornography their boys are having [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6363.5s)]
*  problems launching and becoming active [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6366.8s)]
*  participants in society. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6369.900000000001s)]
*  They're they're dealing with the problems too, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6371.3s)]
*  right? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6373.1s)]
*  So that so that is the predicament, but that also [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6373.900000000001s)]
*  might be why there is some kind of hope because [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6376.0s)]
*  people are realizing it's their own interest to [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6379.5s)]
*  get things together. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6381.1s)]
*  Although unfortunately the ideologues of the left [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6382.200000000001s)]
*  were willing to let communism flourish everywhere [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6385.200000000001s)]
*  and seem to be okay with that. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6388.0s)]
*  So maybe not but us on the individual level of [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6389.900000000001s)]
*  the parent level you want to we listen to parenting [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6393.5s)]
*  podcast. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6398.3s)]
*  We're always looking for parenting tips. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6398.900000000001s)]
*  It's just same like if you want to get in shape you [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6400.2s)]
*  listen to Jim podcast, right? [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6402.8s)]
*  Because you're cultivating the habit of the mind [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6404.2s)]
*  on what matters most which is your kids. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6407.8s)]
*  So it's always about staying in tune with the [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6409.4s)]
*  trends and being mindful of how you're raising [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6411.8s)]
*  them. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6415.9s)]
*  But fundamentally you're protecting your children [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6416.0s)]
*  from this horrible secular world. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6418.0s)]
*  What do you do at school? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6421.8s)]
*  We do homeschool. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6423.8s)]
*  We take them to a homeschool club. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6425.099999999999s)]
*  So homeschool now is a beautiful there's a [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6426.2s)]
*  revolution thanks to ironically enough COVID. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6428.8s)]
*  So COVID the only reason we're having these [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6433.2s)]
*  conversations is because of the COVID lockdowns [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6435.900000000001s)]
*  which shows that good can emerge from evil. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6438.6s)]
*  If the COVID lockdowns hadn't happened nobody [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6441.5s)]
*  would know anything about these schools, right? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6443.8s)]
*  People don't think about that. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6446.8s)]
*  People go all the lockdowns destroy the country. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6447.7s)]
*  The lockdowns harm the country in many ways, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6450.3s)]
*  but we would not have known any of these problems [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6453.400000000001s)]
*  were happening at school if people didn't have [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6455.900000000001s)]
*  homeschool, right? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6457.7s)]
*  So zoom school happens people start paying attention [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6460.099999999999s)]
*  and then they're pulling their kids out of school. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6463.5s)]
*  There's more homeschoolers now than there's ever [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6464.8s)]
*  because they're finding out what the teachers are [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6466.2s)]
*  actually saying that they're not even learning. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6467.7s)]
*  You're realizing I'm sending my kids to daycare. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6469.9s)]
*  Maybe we can find a way to make this work financially [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6472.8s)]
*  for my wife to stay home or maybe we can find [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6475.599999999999s)]
*  some kind of solution. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6478.2s)]
*  So what became kind of popular is a homeschool [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6479.3s)]
*  co-optic home homeschool pod. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6482.2s)]
*  How does it work? [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6484.0s)]
*  You pull money together and you hire teachers. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6485.0s)]
*  So let's say your kids were in school. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6487.6s)]
*  There's teachers who want out of the public school [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6490.200000000001s)]
*  system and you have three to five friends and you [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6493.0s)]
*  say, well, why don't we just hire the teacher to [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6496.400000000001s)]
*  teach our kids, right? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6498.6s)]
*  So it's not really homeschool. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6500.200000000001s)]
*  You're making your own school. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6501.5s)]
*  It sounds like. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6502.6s)]
*  Yeah, but you do it part-time and then you school [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6503.1s)]
*  them at the house too. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6505.3s)]
*  So the biggest misconception of homeschooling [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6507.0s)]
*  is that you're like little house on the prairie [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6510.900000000001s)]
*  and your kids are on a bench and you're the mom [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6513.3s)]
*  in the front right in the chalkboard. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6514.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6516.0s)]
*  That was never homeschooling. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6516.5s)]
*  Anyway, homeschooling was always self-directed [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6517.8s)]
*  teaching kids how to teach themselves and then [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6520.5s)]
*  helping them coach them along through the material [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6523.400000000001s)]
*  as they struggle with it. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6526.400000000001s)]
*  But kids are generally naturally curious and [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6527.7s)]
*  will figure things out in their own way, but you're [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6530.3s)]
*  providing them enough structure to make sure [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6533.2s)]
*  that they just don't play outside. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6534.900000000001s)]
*  I'm embarrassed. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6536.0s)]
*  I don't know more about this. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6536.5s)]
*  I of course, I love the sound of it, but how [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6537.3s)]
*  common is it for friends or neighbors to get [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6539.7s)]
*  together, pool their money and hire a teacher in [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6542.0s)]
*  Austin Silicon Valley and in certain areas. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6544.2s)]
*  I wouldn't call it common, but it's not anything [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6548.5s)]
*  that would be way off the beaten path. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6550.4s)]
*  Are you doing that? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6552.4s)]
*  We do something similar. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6553.7s)]
*  Yeah, there there was a structure created and [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6555.2s)]
*  we pay we pay tuition. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6558.4s)]
*  We pay whatever fees and then there's a nonprofit [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6560.9s)]

*  So we donated to the nonprofit. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6563.9s)]
*  So remember Elon Musk got quote-unquote in trouble [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6565.5s)]
*  because they said he gave all this money to a nonprofit, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6567.7s)]
*  but the nonprofit teaches his kids and you're [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6570.4s)]
*  like, well, they teach other kids too, but isn't [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6573.2s)]
*  that where you would want to donate your money? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6575.099999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6577.2s)]
*  Like if I'm going to donate to a nonprofit, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6577.599999999999s)]
*  wouldn't I want to donate it to a homeschool [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6580.099999999999s)]
*  supported charity, right? [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6584.099999999999s)]
*  And so yeah, we are kids do a part-time. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6586.099999999999s)]
*  They do a part-time schedule. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6589.099999999999s)]
*  What are the expenses like as compared to private [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6590.2s)]
*  or Catholic school? [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6592.4s)]
*  It'd be probably it was certainly cheaper than [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6593.3s)]
*  these hoity-toity grooming Catholic school or [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6598.8s)]
*  grooming. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6601.3s)]
*  I mean, private schools. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6601.7s)]
*  Yeah, it would be on par with what a Catholic [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6603.1s)]
*  school tuition would be working. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6604.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6607.1s)]
*  Are you satisfied so far with the results? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6607.5s)]
*  No, yeah, we're thrilled. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6609.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we're thrilled and what we do as because [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6610.900000000001s)]
*  again homeschooling isn't what people think we're [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6615.0s)]
*  still. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6617.400000000001s)]
*  Voluntarily tracked by the state. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6619.200000000001s)]
*  So the state has somebody check in with my wife. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6621.6s)]
*  They interview the kids and then my kids will take [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6624.400000000001s)]
*  the standardized tests to make sure that they're on [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6626.5s)]
*  path with the curriculum, which we're fine with if [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6629.400000000001s)]
*  school were school we'd send our kids to public [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6632.8s)]
*  school if school were hey, here's your course material. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6634.6s)]
*  Here's what you learn. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6638.1s)]
*  Here's how you take it. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6638.8s)]
*  We still homeschool honestly, but we so because [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6639.400000000001s)]
*  that's just the way I am but we don't have a problem [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6642.0s)]
*  with the testing and everything is ddology. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6645.1s)]
*  So we're we're on track. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6648.5s)]
*  Our kids take the test that a normal kid would take [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6650.8s)]
*  and then they they talk to like a liaison who's [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6653.6s)]
*  in teaching and she's a wonderful person and it's [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6658.8s)]
*  very helpful and they just check in with the kids [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6660.6s)]
*  make sure the kids are okay, which I'm fine with [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6662.7s)]
*  that too. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6664.7s)]
*  Is there any downside to this? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6665.0s)]
*  I mean it's all upside there. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6668.2s)]
*  You know, you never want to say that so downside [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6669.4s)]
*  because that means you're high on your own supply, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6671.099999999999s)]
*  right? [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6672.599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6672.9s)]
*  But they they socialize with other kids. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6673.7s)]
*  They were with kids of all age groups that way. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6676.7s)]
*  Remember we would go to school. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6679.5s)]
*  You're in a class and you're with people only your [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6680.4s)]
*  own age and when children talk to people of other [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6682.099999999999s)]
*  ages, they become more advanced with their communication. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6686.599999999999s)]
*  Yes, that is totally true. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6689.4s)]
*  So people often think that my oldest daughter is [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6690.9s)]
*  older than she is. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6693.2s)]
*  No, no, she just spends a lot of time talking to [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6694.799999999999s)]
*  adults and talking to eighth graders and seventh [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6696.7s)]
*  graders and sixth graders and fifth graders and [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6699.099999999999s)]
*  it's all kid appropriate because the model of the [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6701.0s)]
*  co-op or the they probably don't even call it [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6704.799999999999s)]
*  homeschool co-op. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6706.9s)]
*  They call it probably something else. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6707.4s)]
*  There's probably a different terminology, but [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6709.0s)]
*  it's Waldorf based. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6711.599999999999s)]
*  It's nature based is based on the wonder and [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6712.7s)]
*  magical childhood you go in is very much about [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6715.4s)]
*  storytelling and participating with nature and [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6718.7s)]
*  that's the one that they go to. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6722.099999999999s)]
*  I have friends who they set up one and it's more [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6723.9s)]
*  tech based. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6726.8s)]
*  There are a lot of tech guys who want their kids [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6727.5s)]
*  kind of coding which I don't think a five-year-old [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6729.0s)]
*  needs to learn to code. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6731.099999999999s)]
*  Plus the coding language who knows will even be [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6732.9s)]
*  well with AI no one needs to learn to code. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6734.9s)]
*  Anyway, right. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6736.9s)]
*  But every but there are people who are trying to [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6738.2s)]
*  find solutions. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6740.5s)]
*  But the flip side is a lot of parents do want the [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6741.4s)]
*  daycare aspect. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6744.599999999999s)]
*  So homeschooling if you don't like your kids then [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6746.3s)]
*  homeschooling is a very has this huge downside. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6750.7s)]
*  Yeah, because if you don't like your kids just [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6756.6s)]
*  send it to public school. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6758.400000000001s)]
*  I mean that's not yeah, if you don't like your kids [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6759.2s)]
*  you show them off. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6760.8s)]
*  But if you're there just send them to Sidwell in [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6761.8s)]
*  DC or something like that, right exactly because [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6763.7s)]
*  you don't like your kids and you're ambitious and [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6765.6s)]

*  You know you can drive out I've made it in life. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6974.0s)]

*  legs die your kids could get died in a crash. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6980.2s)]
*  It's never over right but in our in our human [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6984.0s)]
*  brains with the ego we either go to I'm a winner [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6987.3s)]
*  and I'm in a static place of winning or I'm a [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6991.8s)]
*  loser everything is so bad in society and this is [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6995.2s)]
*  where I am. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6997.9s)]
*  So in your own mind what you want to do is break [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=6999.4s)]
*  that narrative arc and realize you're not a [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7001.3s)]
*  winner and I lose or you're you're at a given point [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7003.7s)]
*  in time and anything could change for the better [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7005.8s)]
*  or the worse in a moment. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7008.2s)]
*  So do the best you can right now while you're here [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7009.8s)]
*  and keep pushing forward. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7011.900000000001s)]
*  Amen. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7014.0s)]
*  So the last thing I'm going to ask you about and I [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7015.0s)]
*  just want to take a really dark turn if we could [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7017.400000000001s)]
*  is Epstein done a lot on this first give us the [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7021.0s)]

*  What was that? [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7026.7s)]
*  What is the truth of his life and death? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7027.900000000001s)]
*  And when are the rest of us going to get all the [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7031.400000000001s)]
*  details on this? [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7035.1s)]
*  We will never know the truth about what happened [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7037.5s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein because it was clearly an [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7039.7s)]
*  intelligence operation right. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7042.900000000001s)]
*  It was clearly a form of blackmail in a form of [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7045.5s)]
*  keeping people confined to the narrative. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7049.8s)]
*  So the Epstein documents the way they came about [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7053.6s)]
*  was a friend of mine who's a lawyer said I've never [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7056.7s)]

*  There's this litigation going involving Jeffrey [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7061.3s)]
*  Epstein and everything is redacted and this is [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7063.099999999999s)]
*  filed in federal court and as you know, you don't [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7065.4s)]
*  when was this 2016 ish 2017 ish and he said you [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7067.9s)]
*  won't believe this. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7072.5s)]
*  You can't do that because if you want a confidential [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7073.599999999999s)]
*  dispute resolution can do mediation arbitration. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7076.099999999999s)]
*  If you're in public courts and litigation your [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7078.7s)]

*  suing and what's alleged is not redacted. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7083.8s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's a public it's a public it's our [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7085.9s)]
*  justice system. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7088.2s)]
*  Yeah, go do arbitration if you want private right [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7089.1s)]
*  confidential and he goes why don't we just file a [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7091.400000000001s)]
*  motion to unseal and I thought it'd be some like [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7093.700000000001s)]
*  little side project and wouldn't cost so much [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7097.6s)]

*  There's no such thing as an easy win in law, but [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7120.8s)]
*  to the extent that there's an easy win. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7122.6s)]

*  and won't take that much time or money. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7130.400000000001s)]
*  Oh the opposite the judge ruled against us after [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7132.8s)]
*  sitting on the case for a long time on privacy [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7139.0s)]
*  grounds. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7141.900000000001s)]
*  There was no again. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7142.7s)]
*  That's not how the law works. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7143.8s)]
*  Law isn't that you have the right to privacy and [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7144.9s)]

*  public litigation. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7151.4s)]
*  That shouldn't happen. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7154.099999999999s)]
*  We think oh God, this is more more than we realized. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7155.2s)]
*  So we go against we got to appeal it. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7159.5s)]
*  So then we file an appeal in the Second Circuit [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7161.4s)]
*  Court of Appeals and meanwhile the money is just [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7163.099999999999s)]

*  You thought there was just going to be some easy [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7171.2s)]

*  at right. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7174.3s)]

*  you know, it's a Bengal tiger in your face and you [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7181.5s)]

*  Are you serious? [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7209.8s)]
*  Did that really happen? [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7210.9s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7212.1s)]
*  So this is another unbelievable story. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7213.3s)]
*  It's like a Forrest Gump thing. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7216.7s)]
*  How do I get involved with Jeffrey Epstein? [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7217.7s)]
*  Just some random guy on the internet Twitter. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7219.2s)]
*  How bizarre. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7221.4s)]
*  So me and Mark Rendaas was the lawyer. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7223.0s)]
*  So Rendaas and Mark Rendaas said, hey, why don't we [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7225.2s)]
*  just get these unsealed? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7227.1s)]
*  You're always talking about pedophile stuff. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7228.8s)]
*  This is such an easy win for you. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7231.2s)]
*  And he goes into cases interesting to me. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7233.599999999999s)]
*  So I'll cut you a break on fees. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7236.0s)]
*  We both thought going in that it was going to be [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7237.7s)]
*  something that you could get done for a reasonable [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7240.4s)]
*  amount of money and a reasonable amount of time. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7242.4s)]
*  And it took years. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7245.2s)]
*  So we filed a suit and the motion to unseal and [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7246.3s)]
*  then the judge rules against us. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7250.2s)]
*  We appealed the Second Circuit Court appeals in [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7253.0s)]
*  New York and then during the this is during the [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7254.9s)]
*  Trump administration Epstein is still free hasn't [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7258.4s)]
*  arrested a friend of mine. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7260.3s)]
*  One of the good guys in the intelligence community [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7262.3s)]
*  said, Hey, just so you know, you shouldn't mention [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7264.1s)]
*  Epstein anymore. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7266.5s)]
*  You're you're in a real problem. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7268.0s)]
*  They go you got into something really that you [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7269.6s)]
*  didn't know what you were getting into. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7271.7s)]
*  And I go, okay, what do you want to do? [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7274.0s)]
*  They go just stand by. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7275.400000000001s)]
*  You're in court. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7277.3s)]
*  That'll work its way through, but you need you [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7278.2s)]
*  need to not draw attention to this issue or [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7280.0s)]
*  yourself. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7281.900000000001s)]
*  And I said, okay, that's message received. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7283.1s)]
*  And this is someone in the most incredible. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7286.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is a real in the Intel world. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7288.400000000001s)]
*  So yeah, this isn't some guy who reads me on [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7290.0s)]
*  Twitter worried about me after a divine vision. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7292.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is a real a real real thing. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7294.7s)]
*  And so I didn't talk about it for about a year. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7296.9s)]
*  And then what happened is the Miami Herald Julie [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7301.3s)]
*  Brown filed the same motion to unseal kind of [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7303.2s)]
*  that I had filed and piggybacked on me. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7306.6s)]
*  And then that's what started to break up with [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7309.6s)]
*  the Epstein thing. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7311.0s)]
*  So then my guy in the intelligence world said, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7312.2s)]
*  okay, you're green light now. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7314.1s)]
*  They're not going to kill Julie Brown in the Miami [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7315.6s)]
*  Herald. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7317.1s)]
*  Everybody's going to talk about it. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7317.9s)]
*  So let the chips fall where they may. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7319.400000000001s)]
*  So then I re-entered the discourse on it because [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7321.6s)]
*  there you can't kill everybody kind of how they [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7326.5s)]
*  say, right? [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7328.5s)]
*  Yeah, you can kill one guy. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7329.0s)]
*  You can have one guy getting a car crash, but [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7330.1s)]
*  you're not going to go after the Miami Herald or [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7332.200000000001s)]
*  other people. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7333.6s)]
*  Now, what is very sad to me about the Epstein [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7334.5s)]
*  story is if you look at the timeline and you look [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7338.8s)]
*  at the why Epstein became relevant again, and [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7341.1s)]
*  this isn't Julie Brown Julie Brown to her credit [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7344.900000000001s)]
*  had the right motives, but Jake Tapper and others [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7347.0s)]
*  didn't. A man by the name of Alexander Acosta [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7348.8s)]
*  was a secretary of labor of Donald Trump. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7352.1s)]
*  So you now have an orange man bad angle because [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7354.5s)]
*  Alexander Acosta was the prosecuting attorney who [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7358.5s)]
*  oversaw the original plea agreement with Jeffrey [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7361.7s)]
*  Epstein, which could only be defined as a sweetheart [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7364.2s)]
*  plea deal defying any kind of logic. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7366.5s)]
*  And the media now had Trump bad because Acosta's [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7369.400000000001s)]
*  Trump Epstein Trump the Trump Epstein angle right [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7375.4s)]
*  now the media suddenly cared or pretended to care [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7380.0s)]
*  about the issue because they could use the Epstein [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7382.099999999999s)]
*  issue to get after Trump. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7384.599999999999s)]
*  So then every media outlet wanted access to the [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7386.9s)]
*  Epstein files because they were hoping there was [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7389.099999999999s)]
*  a Trump angle too. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7391.0s)]
*  So then suddenly it became a big deal. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7392.0s)]
*  So we go up before the Second Circuit Court of [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7395.099999999999s)]
*  Appeals Mark Rida's and Jay Wolman argue the case [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7396.7s)]
*  and by now the meter is like turning man. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7400.2s)]
*  I'm like stressing dude and you're and you're [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7402.299999999999s)]
*  paying for this. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7404.4s)]
*  They gave me a break on fees, but they would [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7406.0s)]
*  normally charge anybody else that would have been [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7407.799999999999s)]
*  a million dollar legal fee plus the but we had some [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7409.599999999999s)]
*  of us pro bono, but I was still paying. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7413.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I was still sending big checks just [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7415.299999999999s)]
*  because you thought it was interesting. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7417.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7419.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7420.0s)]
*  And well, and I didn't know it was if I didn't [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7420.5s)]
*  know how big it was going to be. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7422.0s)]
*  I might have had second thoughts but the because [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7423.599999999999s)]
*  they did me good on I don't want to make it seem [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7426.599999999999s)]
*  like a complaining. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7428.2s)]
*  This is this is the nature of the American legal [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7429.0s)]
*  system because that's why people go. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7430.9s)]
*  Why don't you see that person? [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7432.7s)]
*  They said something about you. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7433.7s)]
*  It's like, I don't know. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7434.5s)]
*  Why don't I write a check for 3.5 million dollars [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7435.8s)]
*  to litigate a defamation case against somebody [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7438.3s)]
*  because they called me something on the internet, [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7440.3s)]
*  you know, people don't understand that until [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7442.1s)]
*  they're in that world and they realize how much [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7445.2s)]
*  all this stuff costs. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7447.2s)]
*  So Miami Herald probably probably spent two million [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7448.0s)]
*  on fees and so they argue the case. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7450.2s)]
*  The Second Circuit made it abundantly clear that [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7453.7s)]
*  they were going to unseal the files because there [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7457.4s)]
*  was no way in the world under established law [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7459.4s)]
*  that the file should have been sealed in the first [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7462.1s)]
*  place and oral argument happens. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7464.2s)]
*  It's so clear that they're going to unseal it. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7467.099999999999s)]
*  I think oral argument happens on Friday and I'm [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7469.9s)]
*  like, all right, this is good. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7472.099999999999s)]
*  Two days later, I think is arrested flying back [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7474.099999999999s)]
*  from France. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7477.099999999999s)]
*  The only reason he was arrested was because the [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7478.5s)]
*  files are going to be unsealed because he was [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7482.5s)]
*  told he was not going to be arrested. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7484.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7485.9s)]
*  The mop up operation had worked but for me and [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7486.4s)]
*  more importantly, but for Julie Brown because I [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7489.7s)]
*  think if it had just been me, they could have [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7491.599999999999s)]
*  just buried the case long enough. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7492.9s)]
*  They could have issued an unpublished opinion that [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7494.799999999999s)]
*  wouldn't have precedent of value because the way [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7497.5s)]
*  it works is a trial court judge is more likely to [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7501.2s)]
*  make up the law against you than an appellate court [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7503.7s)]
*  because an appellate court will have presidential [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7506.2s)]
*  value and apply in other cases. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7508.099999999999s)]
*  So the trial court could have just they gave me a [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7510.5s)]
*  fake ruling because who cares? [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7513.299999999999s)]
*  It's Mike Sernovich and then the Second Circuit [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7514.799999999999s)]
*  could have moved it to a shadow docket and ruled [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7518.0s)]
*  against me. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7520.799999999999s)]
*  But once Julie Brown entered the case, you can't [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7521.3s)]
*  ignore the Miami Herald, right? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7524.2s)]
*  I think I'm a big deal but compared to Miami [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7526.3s)]
*  Herald, I don't have any legitimacy at all. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7528.1s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7530.7s)]
*  And then every other outlet got involved too. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7531.7s)]
*  So then the regime realized well, the Epstein [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7535.7s)]
*  stuff is coming out. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7539.2s)]
*  We better look like we're doing something. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7540.0s)]
*  And then so Jeffrey Epstein was at least a couple [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7542.400000000001s)]
*  or was arrested a couple of days after all argument [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7544.400000000001s)]
*  because they realized we have a mess now. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7547.900000000001s)]
*  What do we do? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7550.9s)]
*  So then Epstein gets arrested and then do you want [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7552.099999999999s)]
*  me to keep going? [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7555.7s)]
*  I'm actually spellbound. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7556.299999999999s)]
*  So to channel Dr. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7560.099999999999s)]
*  Gene Scott get on the telephones on the phones. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7560.9s)]
*  So then they charged Epstein but a little bit of [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7565.0s)]
*  like legal trivia. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7570.599999999999s)]
*  I went there for the press conference. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7572.2s)]
*  I read the indictment and the indictment was what [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7573.599999999999s)]
*  you would charge someone if you wanted to create [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7576.799999999999s)]
*  a media narrative that you were prosecuting them [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7580.3s)]
*  but that under the law would be chicken shit stuff. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7583.1s)]
*  The lowest thing that you could possibly charge him [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7586.6s)]
*  for but you could say we're going after him. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7588.900000000001s)]
*  There's a reason they did it this way. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7591.5s)]
*  They charged him for paying for massages in his [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7593.6s)]
*  New York apartment through I think the period of [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7596.7s)]
*  2014 to 2016 somewhere in the timeline massages [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7599.5s)]
*  in his apartment. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7604.0s)]
*  That's all they charged him for the four corners [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7605.0s)]
*  of the indictment. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7607.0s)]
*  So why did they only charge him for that? [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7608.400000000001s)]
*  There's a reason. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7610.7s)]
*  He had a place in New Mexico. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7612.6s)]
*  He had his island. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7615.0s)]
*  He had his place in Paris. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7616.3s)]
*  He had another place I think in West Palm Beach. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7618.1s)]
*  And if they charged him for trafficking the FBI [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7620.7s)]
*  would have had to simultaneously raid every property [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7623.900000000001s)]
*  under a man act. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7627.400000000001s)]
*  The man act makes it a crime to transport a woman [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7628.8s)]
*  in state lines. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7631.0s)]
*  Yep and international too. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7631.7s)]
*  So he was flying back from Paris and he was flying [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7633.400000000001s)]
*  women models all over the world models, you know, [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7635.900000000001s)]
*  not to diminish what he's doing, but that's was his [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7638.6s)]
*  story. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7640.2s)]
*  He was flying underage girls and some of age all [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7640.8s)]
*  around the world. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7643.6s)]
*  Well what you would do with the SDNY which as we [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7645.0s)]
*  know the SDNY they go after you got problems [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7647.5s)]
*  because they charge the most aggressive. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7651.6s)]
*  They're too aggressive. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7653.6s)]
*  In fact, in how they charge cases what you would [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7654.6s)]
*  have charged it. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7657.0s)]
*  If you were concerned with being a prosecutor you [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7658.3s)]
*  would have charged him under the man act and under [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7661.2s)]
*  the international version of the man act you would [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7663.900000000001s)]
*  have simultaneously searched and seized every [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7666.2s)]
*  property taking all the evidence. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7668.1s)]
*  Instead they arrested him had a little press conference. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7671.400000000001s)]
*  It was over massages in New York property. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7674.1s)]
*  They searched the New York property. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7676.3s)]
*  What was happening in the island? [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7678.1s)]
*  We don't know what happened to the island. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7680.900000000001s)]
*  We don't know because the FBI said we can't search [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7683.6s)]
*  it because nothing that he was charged with concerned [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7686.6s)]
*  the app because of course the FBI is very concerned [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7690.3s)]
*  now with due process. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7692.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, yeah, they're really you know, we [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7693.6s)]
*  don't want to go overstep our lawful authority. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7695.400000000001s)]
*  So we can't go raid that island. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7697.8s)]
*  So they left all these properties undetended and [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7700.0s)]
*  then that's when the mop up operation commenced and [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7702.7s)]
*  they got whatever compromising CDs and DVRs and [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7705.2s)]
*  other information. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7708.400000000001s)]
*  They got that from the intelligence community got [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7709.5s)]
*  that from all the properties. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7711.8s)]
*  May I ask you to pause for one second? [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7712.7s)]
*  So this is happening in 2017? [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7713.8s)]
*  No by the time it came to fruition. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7716.7s)]
*  Yeah, now we're in 1819. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7718.400000000001s)]
*  Okay, right. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7719.7s)]
*  So it would have been Bill Barr the Republican [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7720.7s)]
*  Attorney General his second time as Attorney General. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7723.3s)]
*  He would have been aware of all this correct. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7726.4s)]
*  Oh the yeah, I'm not sure if Barr was and at the [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7728.0s)]
*  time we'd have to double check it. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7730.2s)]
*  But whoever is AG would absolutely have been aware [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7731.2s)]
*  of it. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7734.0s)]
*  And I think it was Bill Barr because Bill Barr is [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7734.5s)]
*  the one who said that he watched footage of Epstein [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7736.3s)]
*  committing suicide and he knows but we can't watch [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7738.6s)]
*  the footage of Epstein committing suicide. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7741.1s)]
*  Bill Barr can but we can't that's a little sauce, [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7742.8s)]
*  right? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7745.3s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7746.1s)]
*  Bill Barr covered up the murder of Epstein. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7746.7s)]
*  Well clearly right, but I'm just saying like what [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7748.4s)]
*  I like to do which I found helps me be more [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7750.9s)]
*  persuasive is I will meet you with what you claim [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7755.1s)]
*  even when I know it's a lie. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7758.900000000001s)]
*  So I know that Bill Barr is lying but I would just [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7760.700000000001s)]
*  for the sake of argument except it is true that [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7763.5s)]
*  Bill Barr saw the video of Epstein killing himself. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7765.700000000001s)]
*  Well, therefore you would have to explain why you [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7768.3s)]
*  can't release that video or show it to other people [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7769.900000000001s)]
*  because if the video exists the public would clearly [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7772.8s)]
*  have a right to see it. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7774.8s)]
*  That's right or designated trusted intermediaries [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7775.8s)]
*  would so rather than say well Bill Barr is lying. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7778.400000000001s)]
*  I like to just say okay buddy and by the way, [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7781.6s)]
*  that's a trait of lawyering a lot of police detectives [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7783.8s)]
*  use that too is I'll follow along with your bullshit [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7786.0s)]
*  and then I'll just start pulling pulling the threads [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7789.2s)]
*  a little bit. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7791.0s)]
*  So yeah, it would have been Bill Barr and so Epstein [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7792.2s)]
*  gets charged with the lowest possible conic that he [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7794.0s)]
*  ever could have been charged with and all their properties [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7797.3s)]
*  were left unattended. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7801.1s)]
*  So mop up teams went in there took whatever they [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7802.0s)]
*  needed to take out there and then Epstein commits [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7804.3s)]
*  suicide. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7807.0s)]
*  So the end of the story was to talk about all gone [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7808.2s)]
*  now all in nice sight that the ending of the usual [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7810.8s)]
*  suspects. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7813.4s)]
*  It's like he never existed. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7814.599999999999s)]
*  What happened to all the evidence? [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7816.7s)]
*  The I'm the intelligence apparatus is have it so but [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7819.2s)]
*  we read that the other hundreds of thousands of hours [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7821.799999999999s)]
*  of video tape from his various properties of this [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7824.799999999999s)]
*  effect. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7828.099999999999s)]
*  That's not a yeah, that's not something that was in. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7828.5s)]
*  So where is all that tape, you know? [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7831.299999999999s)]
*  Vaults vaults in Washington DC or Fort Knox wherever [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7833.7s)]
*  Bill Barr had it sent. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7837.0s)]
*  Yeah, whatever physical location Bill Barr and whatever [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7838.5s)]
*  five eyes agencies. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7842.7s)]
*  He was working with stored it. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7843.900000000001s)]
*  They have all that black military on people to this [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7845.7s)]
*  day and though they'll release it if they need to but [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7848.2s)]
*  everybody's kind of playing ball. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7851.0s)]
*  You find out that Bill Gates was there often where the [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7852.8s)]

*  Why, you know, it's not not sincere. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7871.8s)]
*  I would support the universal enforcement of cancel [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7874.6s)]

*  propped up. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7922.599999999999s)]
*  So clearly the media was in on the Epstein stuff [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7923.5s)]
*  because otherwise you would hound Bill Gates to his [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7928.1s)]

*  Well, I was trying to raise money for MIT. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7950.7s)]
*  He's got his own narrative. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7953.1s)]
*  But yeah, this has all been reported and authenticated [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7954.6s)]
*  by the Wall Street Journal. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7956.9s)]
*  Because I would never say anything untrue about Reid [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7959.0s)]
*  Hoffman. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7960.7s)]

*  people over anyway. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7963.8s)]
*  Yeah, so you would definitely I think he funded the [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7965.1s)]
*  suit against Trump. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7967.7s)]
*  Yeah, he's he's yeah, he's funding all the lawfare [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7969.1s)]

*  one by one. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7973.4s)]
*  And if we had a legitimate media you would hound him [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7974.8s)]
*  every time. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7981.9s)]
*  I mean how many times did people when when you were [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7983.4s)]

*  post they would make on Twitter. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7991.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7992.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7993.099999999999s)]
*  Well, I tried to destroy their lives. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7993.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're trying to go after some staffer over a [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7994.8s)]
*  post that was maybe poorly worded or didn't have [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=7997.3s)]
*  sufficient nuance in a on a platform that doesn't [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8000.7s)]
*  allow for it didn't allow for the time sufficient [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8003.5s)]
*  nuance. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8005.4s)]
*  But you're like, oh yeah, we're cool with all these [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8006.5s)]
*  other people though. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8008.2s)]
*  They're they're they're the good guys and that shows [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8009.5s)]
*  you that we don't have a media we have propaganda [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8012.3s)]
*  out for the intelligence community and they're been [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8015.3s)]
*  kind of given their marching orders on who's allowed [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8018.1s)]
*  in the discourse and who's allowed to be propped up [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8021.6s)]
*  and who's allowed to get away with things that they [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8023.6s)]
*  got away with and then all of Epstein's associates [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8025.5s)]
*  they're fine. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8030.3s)]
*  Nobody got damaged. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8030.8s)]
*  How many people's lot reputations were sullied? [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8031.8s)]
*  I would give an example of compare what's been done [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8035.0s)]
*  to somebody like Peter Bremolo or Jared Taylor who I [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8038.7s)]
*  obviously don't agree with a lot of their stuff. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8043.400000000001s)]
*  But you have to add those qualifiers. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8045.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, but compare them to people who palled [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8047.0s)]
*  around with Epstein or the Sackler family and how [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8051.6s)]
*  the billionaire yeah, the Sackler killed all those [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8054.2s)]
*  people. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8056.1s)]
*  Yeah, and they escaped criminal charges or Boeing [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8056.7s)]
*  which just did a civil fine for all the people they [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8059.7s)]
*  killed because of their cover-ups and their crimes [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8061.8s)]
*  what they get away with. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8064.9s)]
*  So if you're if you're in a world where you say [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8066.3s)]
*  something offensive maybe unintentionally you're [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8069.4s)]
*  done at least in terms of how they can't define the [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8073.0s)]
*  discourse in the way they once did but you're sullied [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8076.5s)]
*  forever. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8079.299999999999s)]
*  You have a scarlet letter on you forever and you [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8079.799999999999s)]
*  have to learn to accept that and overcome it. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8082.099999999999s)]
*  But you're you're there's a ceiling on you for sure [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8084.599999999999s)]
*  and but you can be a friend with Epstein because the [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8087.9s)]
*  media and the intelligence communities are all [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8092.0s)]
*  working together. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8093.599999999999s)]
*  So they'll make sure that your life isn't made too [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8094.4s)]
*  difficult for what you did. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8096.799999999999s)]
*  Are we ever going to know more? [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8100.599999999999s)]
*  Do you think about Epstein? [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8101.900000000001s)]
*  No by 20 years. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8103.6s)]
*  I mean there's that book Chaos which was about MK [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8104.900000000001s)]
*  Ulshur on the Charles Manson. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8107.6s)]
*  So in 50 years when nobody can be damaged and nothing [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8109.1s)]
*  can really be done. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8111.5s)]
*  We'll learn about the we'll learn about the truth of [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8113.0s)]
*  it maybe but there's a great conspiracy theory, [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8115.400000000001s)]
*  which is the government or rather is a meme about [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8117.7s)]
*  conspiracy theories, which they dismisses as a [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8120.7s)]
*  conspiracy conspiracy theory 20 years ago, then they [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8123.1s)]
*  admit it. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8127.0s)]
*  But now they tell you whatever you're accusing them [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8128.0s)]
*  of today is a conspiracy theory. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8129.8s)]
*  And it keeps getting pushed forward. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8131.6s)]
*  Last question. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8135.0s)]
*  Do you know the effect of all of this the evaporation [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8137.0s)]
*  of like recognizable reality has made everyone [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8142.3s)]
*  super paranoid and I have noticed probably too [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8145.0s)]
*  paranoid because it's not helpful to be that [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8148.8s)]
*  paranoid. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8150.400000000001s)]
*  But do you think that the US government is working [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8151.400000000001s)]
*  aggressively to spread disinformation within [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8157.5s)]

*  within the right-wing movement right-wing movement [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8168.900000000001s)]

*  You think that's real? [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8173.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah to discredit people that was the CIA. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8174.6s)]
*  They there was a book called Intel Pro you can read [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8177.8s)]
*  the CIA manual on how you disrupt movements, which [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8179.7s)]
*  I read and what they would do the CIA would do at [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8183.0s)]
*  the time they're doing it to the Black Panthers. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8186.5s)]
*  But now they're doing it to anybody who's deemed [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8188.6s)]
*  a Christian or goes to a Catholic Church is they [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8191.2s)]
*  have various tactics and one tactic they do is [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8193.8s)]
*  they call it stone. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8196.5s)]
*  What do you call it when you keep talking filibustering? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8199.3s)]
*  So you'll you have a group and you'll have two [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8201.8s)]

*  We've talked for too long. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8211.6s)]
*  It's time to take action and then that only works [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8212.7s)]
*  on the really desperate people who don't have [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8215.8s)]
*  anything going on which happened post 9-11 to [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8219.0s)]
*  Muslim kids. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8221.699999999999s)]
*  If we're being fully honest here, this isn't a new [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8222.3s)]
*  thing happening to us and what was us it was happening [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8224.4s)]
*  to Muslims and a lot of conservatives didn't really [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8226.9s)]
*  care. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8228.8s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8229.0s)]
*  The FBI stopped another terrorist attack. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8229.699999999999s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8231.4s)]
*  They found some poor Muslim kid who was lonely, [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8231.8s)]
*  maybe mildly autistic and they planned a whole thing [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8234.8s)]
*  for him or he had non mainstream opinions but [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8238.3s)]
*  wasn't hurting and you're by the way, you're allowed [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8241.3s)]
*  to have non mainstream opinions. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8243.1s)]
*  In fact, that's the whole point of this country is [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8244.5s)]
*  allowing you to have non mainstream opinions. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8247.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8249.3s)]
*  So now it's our turn in the barrel. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8249.5s)]
*  So on the one hand, they'll try to do that with [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8251.1s)]
*  low-hanging fruit. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8252.9s)]
*  On the other hand, they'll have people who filibuster [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8253.9s)]
*  and make it so that nothing can really get done. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8258.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8261.4s)]
*  So there'll be the more elegant way to disrupt a [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8262.1s)]
*  political movement isn't to Fed Trap people is to [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8264.5s)]
*  run off the clock. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8268.1s)]
*  So I think for example, Q the cube thing trust the [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8269.1s)]
*  plan. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8272.1s)]
*  I believe that was intelligence operation done. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8272.8s)]
*  The reason I think that is because if you go back to [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8276.0s)]
*  2018, the entire narrative being spread to Maga [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8278.300000000001s)]
*  world was there's going to be a massive red wave in [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8283.7s)]
*  2018. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8287.400000000001s)]
*  We are going to overtake Congress and Trump is going [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8288.900000000001s)]
*  to accomplish all of these things and millions of [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8291.0s)]
*  people, maybe tens of millions of people believed [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8293.5s)]
*  it. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8295.2s)]
*  Well, what happened? [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8296.1s)]
*  What happens when you believe that everything is [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8297.900000000001s)]
*  going to be okay and it's being worked on? [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8301.0s)]
*  Well, you don't push you don't pressure guys. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8303.1s)]
*  You don't register voters. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8307.0s)]
*  You don't turn out to vote. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8308.2s)]
*  You don't do all that boring grinding because in [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8309.4s)]
*  your mind trust the plan is all being taken care of [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8312.300000000001s)]
*  and might look like President Trump is getting [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8315.7s)]
*  rolled by the deep state, but he's really not. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8317.4s)]
*  This is a faint and what really is going to happen [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8320.2s)]
*  is all these mass arrests are going to happen. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8322.800000000001s)]
*  So I believe I have no direct evidence of this, but [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8324.800000000001s)]
*  my personal belief and I think it's a rational one [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8328.4s)]
*  based on the very manuals that the FBI and CIA [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8331.7s)]
*  wrote was I believe that the entire QAnon [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8335.300000000001s)]
*  movement was made by the intelligence community. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8337.2s)]
*  Do you think that what happened two weeks ago at [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8340.9s)]
*  the debate? [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8345.7s)]
*  Like what was I mean, there's so many levels. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8347.300000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out what that was. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8349.9s)]
*  Everyone is paying attention knew that Biden had [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8351.6s)]
*  some sort of neurological disorder, but the media [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8354.6s)]
*  never admitted it until like four minutes into the [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8358.0s)]
*  debate. All of a sudden the story became this guy's [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8361.4s)]
*  retarded. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8363.5s)]
*  We've got to do something was what was that? [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8364.5s)]
*  I have friends who think that I have friends who [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8368.5s)]
*  believe that the debate was orchestrated by the [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8371.9s)]
*  deep state or Biden's handlers and that's why it [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8376.199999999999s)]
*  ended up the way it did. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8380.699999999999s)]
*  I don't believe that and here's why my belief is [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8381.9s)]
*  that CNN wanted to create a narrative for Trump [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8385.5s)]
*  dodge the debate with Biden. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8388.5s)]
*  So they kept imposing more and more onerous terms [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8390.2s)]
*  on Trump. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8392.4s)]
*  So me and this is why Trump I have a lot to say [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8393.2s)]
*  about Trump and the way he handled things and I [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8396.3s)]
*  have a lot of problems with Trump and but I will [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8398.3s)]
*  say that only Trump is Trump. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8400.6s)]
*  So nobody but Trump would have taken that CNN [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8402.7s)]
*  interview because Trump's magic power, but also [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8404.8s)]
*  is Greek fatal flaw, right? [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8407.7s)]
*  The Greeks would always say your greatest strength [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8409.0s)]
*  is killed. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8410.9s)]
*  Is he so obsessed with mainstream media that he'll [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8412.2s)]
*  interview these people and talk to them all day, [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8414.9s)]
*  even though they hate him and he gives them ratings. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8417.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, when he was president, I said, why don't [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8419.0s)]
*  you just talk to the Daily Caller every day give [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8421.7s)]
*  them everything and then everybody has to watch [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8423.7s)]
*  the Daily Caller give it to Breitbart or why don't [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8425.400000000001s)]
*  you build the conservative media ecosystem? [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8428.0s)]
*  No, because he's a boomer and he's obsessed with [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8430.800000000001s)]
*  prestige media or what I would call regime media [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8432.800000000001s)]
*  regime propaganda. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8435.400000000001s)]
*  So anybody else goes I'm not walking into a CNN [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8436.5s)]
*  ambush. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8438.800000000001s)]
*  This the terms of this are stupid. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8439.800000000001s)]
*  Then the narrative will be Trump won't debate Biden [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8442.0s)]
*  and that's a good narrative they run with but [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8444.7s)]
*  instead Trump said, oh, you're going to turn off [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8447.2s)]
*  my microphone. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8448.7s)]
*  Sure. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8449.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, you're going to make me do this. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8450.5s)]
*  Okay, sure. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8451.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, you're into this. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8452.5s)]
*  Sure. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8453.2s)]
*  Sure. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8453.5s)]
*  So all of the terms. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8454.1s)]
*  Led to the debate having to happen even though [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8456.7s)]
*  it was a setup and then buying shows up. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8459.300000000001s)]
*  We've known for a while. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8462.2s)]
*  He's been sundowning and they had it at night. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8463.1s)]
*  They should have had it during the day. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8466.2s)]
*  That was their fault. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8467.2s)]
*  There was really nothing they could do. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8468.5s)]
*  They gave him seven days arrest. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8469.7s)]
*  He gave him a drug cocktail, but they had to show [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8470.800000000001s)]
*  up. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8472.800000000001s)]
*  They couldn't have him not show up and they were [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8472.900000000001s)]
*  hoping maybe he'd have a good night. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8475.6s)]
*  Because as you know, people with dementia, [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8477.400000000001s)]
*  sometimes they have a good night. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8479.5s)]
*  That's right. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8480.900000000001s)]
*  Sometimes they have a medium night. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8481.5s)]
*  Biden had a terrible night, but that's the gamble [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8483.7s)]
*  you got to run. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8486.7s)]
*  So one reason you never despair is the enemy [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8487.400000000001s)]
*  gets a vote and in this case Trump was the enemy [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8492.400000000001s)]
*  to the regime. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8495.5s)]
*  Trump said, okay, sure. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8496.5s)]
*  I'll show up to your rig thing because I love [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8497.400000000001s)]
*  the media anyway and Trump already preceded a [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8499.300000000001s)]
*  narrative in Maga world to explain any failures. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8501.900000000001s)]
*  The whole thing was rigged anyway. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8504.400000000001s)]
*  So the the narrative was already set that if Trump [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8506.2s)]
*  had a bad night, it was because the debate terms [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8508.300000000001s)]
*  were so unconscionable that he never should have [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8510.900000000001s)]
*  did it, but he did it anyway. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8513.1s)]
*  So he goes in there presses the advantage. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8515.2s)]
*  Biden had a bad night and unusually bad night [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8518.0s)]
*  probably. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8520.7s)]
*  And I don't think we need to because I don't view [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8522.0s)]
*  the the deep state of regime is omniscient. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8524.2s)]
*  I view them as evil bad faith actors, but they [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8526.900000000001s)]
*  are actually less smart than we are and they're [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8530.300000000001s)]

*  been through the crucible so many times and we [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8538.1s)]
*  know we're going to be in the crucible again. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8539.9s)]
*  We can doctor cells a little bit differently [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8541.699999999999s)]
*  than they do. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8544.0s)]
*  They're there. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8544.9s)]
*  It's like you have to remember your speeches [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8545.8s)]
*  from in high school, Julius Caesar and you know, [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8547.9s)]
*  one of the speeches I had to memorize in high [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8551.3s)]
*  school was let me have men about me that are [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8553.199999999999s)]
*  fat sleek headed men's and one that sleeps at [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8555.199999999999s)]
*  night. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8557.8s)]
*  Yann Cassius has a lean and hungry look. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8558.4s)]
*  You don't want the lean and hungry look people [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8561.400000000001s)]
*  around you, right? [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8564.5s)]
*  We're the lean and hungry people were the people [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8565.7s)]
*  that we know that one one misstep were in court, [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8568.400000000001s)]
*  dude. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8571.6s)]
*  We know that the regime will frame us for crimes. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8572.400000000001s)]
*  So not only are we not doing ethically [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8575.0s)]
*  questionable behavior because boy then we'd [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8577.400000000001s)]
*  really be given our neck. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8579.6s)]
*  That's for sure. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8580.7s)]
*  We know these motherfuckers are going to frame [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8581.2s)]
*  us anyway. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8582.7s)]
*  So we're already like, oh my God, I wonder what [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8583.6s)]
*  like whether where they're going to like make [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8585.2s)]
*  up about me shit. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8586.5s)]
*  Whereas all the fat people, the spiritually fat [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8588.0s)]
*  people are so weak and debased because they're [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8591.9s)]
*  the ones cooking everything up that they don't [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8594.2s)]
*  know where their weak sides are, right? [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8596.3s)]
*  So when they're fat world, they're thinking we'll [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8598.3s)]
*  just put Biden up there. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8602.5s)]
*  Maybe he has a good night and we luck out if it's [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8604.2s)]
*  a bad night. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8606.1s)]
*  We'll we'll be okay, but they didn't realize how [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8606.7s)]
*  bad it could be. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8609.1s)]
*  Whereas if someone like you were for because [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8610.5s)]
*  that's also the danger of these people. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8612.6s)]
*  They're so they don't have any counter narrative. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8614.3s)]
*  So if they have somebody like you there and me [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8618.0s)]
*  there, we'd have been saying, eh, maybe this [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8619.599999999999s)]
*  isn't a good idea because the right the problem [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8624.199999999999s)]
*  of the right is we too we self-pleased too much. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8626.599999999999s)]
*  We should self-pleased maybe a little bit less. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8629.5s)]
*  The problem with the left is they police away any [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8632.699999999999s)]
*  kind of opposition view and they allow every [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8635.8s)]
*  crazy in the tent. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8638.5s)]
*  So for us, we know who the crazies are and we [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8640.099999999999s)]
*  know who the feds are and we know to think in [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8643.3s)]
*  those terms. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8645.4s)]
*  Whereas if you're on the left, nobody's crazy. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8646.4s)]
*  Oh, Ilhan Omar, she's great. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8648.5s)]
*  Oh, what was she doing about October 7th? [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8651.0s)]
*  What she's saying? [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8652.9s)]
*  Wait, Rashida Tlaib. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8654.099999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, guys. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8655.0s)]
*  You're not you're so no, no, no, no, no, no, [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8656.0s)]
*  pretend at least pretend for one day to care. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8657.699999999999s)]
*  Oh my oh, now we have a real problem. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8661.0s)]
*  Whereas with with us, we're used to having to [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8663.3s)]
*  police ourselves and the people around us. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8665.699999999999s)]
*  So we maybe don't walk into the the traps or [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8668.9s)]
*  unforced errors that that Biden debate was. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8671.5s)]
*  So that's a very long way of saying I don't think [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8674.3s)]
*  the regime's omniscient. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8676.3s)]
*  I don't think that that was a move to take him out. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8677.6s)]
*  I think that that was pure human groupthink and [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8680.2s)]
*  action. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8683.7s)]
*  And they thought that they could get Trump to not [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8684.7s)]
*  take the debate because the terms were so rigged. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8686.7s)]
*  Very smart analysis as has everything you've said [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8689.3s)]
*  for the past couple hours. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8692.7s)]
*  But so thank you. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8693.5s)]
*  It's my pleasure. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8694.8s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8695.5s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8696.6s)]
*  show. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8700.4s)]
*  I know shocking that in an election year with [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8701.0s)]
*  everything at stake, Google would be putting its [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8704.7s)]
*  thumb on the scale and preventing you from hearing [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8706.9s)]
*  anything that the people in charge don't want you [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8710.300000000001s)]
*  to hear. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8712.9s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8713.4s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8714.7s)]
*  We could whine about it. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8715.800000000001s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8717.1s)]
*  Not in charge of Google. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8718.5s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8719.800000000001s)]
*  The way to get the people in charge to hear. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8721.5s)]
*  Google or we could find a way around it. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8723.4s)]
*  The way that you could actually get information. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8725.9s)]
*  That's true. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8728.4s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8729.9s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8731.9s)]
*  subscribe to our channel. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8734.3s)]
*  Subscribe. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8735.9s)]
*  You'll have a much higher chance of hearing what we [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8737.3s)]
*  say and we hope you will. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk&t=8740.4s)]
