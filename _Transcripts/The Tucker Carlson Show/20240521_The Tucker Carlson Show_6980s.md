# Erik Prince NATO vs. Russia, the Secrets of Drone Warfare, and CIA Corruption
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI)
*  We had this pattern for years of taking, of hoarding tape like you do ammo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Like I don't even shoot 7.62x39 really, it's just not, I'm not that interested, but I have, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  you know, like it's unimaginable how many steel case rounds I have, like why do I have those? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=12.96s)]
*  Because I'm crazy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=17.76s)]
*  Just in case. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=18.72s)]
*  It's like, so the prepper- [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  If you have and not need, then need and not have. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=22.0s)]
*  I totally agree with that, but I'm not rational about it, like I'm sure you, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=23.92s)]
*  who's like equipped an entire private army is, you're pretty rational about it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=27.92s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=31.92s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not exactly sure I need, I don't give a shit, gold, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=32.64s)]
*  ammo, you know, whatever, I just want to hoard it and because I feel, you know, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  I can feel all this stuff and tape is the same way. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=40.32s)]
*  But dudes with guns? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=44.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=46.24s)]
*  Are not a match for dudes with drones. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=47.28s)]
*  So if you're, if you're the kind of person, I'm not, you know, naming names or identifying [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=49.76s)]
*  myself by name, but if you're the kind of person who sees a deal on steel case 7.62x39, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=54.48s)]
*  you're like, I need another 10,000 rounds because in your gut, you feel like something, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=58.96s)]
*  you know, volatility is going. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=63.28s)]
*  How po- is that pointless? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=65.44s)]
*  I've just been reading a book called Firepower, which is a history of, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=68.8s)]
*  basically a history of gunpowder. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=73.76s)]
*  And you track the change of warfare going from spears and longbows to the wheel locks, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=75.36s)]
*  match lock muskets, flintlocks, artillery with bursting rounds. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  And I read that to try to understand we're now through a massive step change. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=87.36s)]
*  Cause you know, um, despite all the techno wizardry of the U S military, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  the best weapon the enemy had was an IED. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=97.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  And now the, and the IDs would be positioned along the road and clacked off remotely. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=100.58s)]
*  Now the enemy can fly the ID at you at 120 miles an hour, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=105.7s)]
*  low to the ground, even in a highly jammed environment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=110.74s)]
*  So the threat, highly jamming, there's no way to stop the signal. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=114.5s)]
*  Highly, highly jammed, right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=118.34s)]
*  Even because the Russians are really good at jamming. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=119.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  And the Ukrainians, they've developed, they've innovated, they've developed a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=122.66s)]
*  new technology called the IED. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=126.02s)]
*  And the Ukrainians, they've developed, they've innovated taking a cheap racing drone, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=128.18s)]
*  like with the goggles that somebody wears, FPV drone. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=132.82s)]
*  And you put a beer can size charge that you can 3d print the casing for it in the field with a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=135.70000000000002s)]
*  little copper disc on the front of it and drive that into the back of a tank. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  And for $1,500, you destroy a $2 million tank. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  So that is like having a sniper rifle versus a guy with a longbow. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=152.58s)]
*  It's a step change in warfare. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=158.18s)]
*  And we're there right now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=160.02s)]
*  And the longer this combat goes in Ukraine, the Russians are getting a lot better. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=161.94s)]
*  Ukrainians have too, but they're just trying to, you know, the battle is the ultimate cauldron [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=167.3s)]
*  of learning. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=174.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=174.9s)]
*  And bad ideas are quickly destroyed and discarded. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=175.4s)]
*  And so the proliferation of that knowledge is staggering. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=179.14s)]
*  So what are we learning from watching? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=184.1s)]
*  I don't think the US military is learning much. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=186.74s)]
*  Good. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=189.14s)]
*  No learning. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=189.94s)]
*  Well, no, the problem is the US weapon systems aren't even that high demand [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=190.9s)]
*  because they're not that effective in that highly jammed environment. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=196.1s)]
*  For 20 years of global war on terror, you were fighting against a very [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=199.94s)]
*  comparatively unsophisticated enemy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=204.26s)]
*  Now in a big state on state type war, the US systems are not holding up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=206.74s)]
*  You know, the Javelin missile, which Raytheon sells to the taxpayers for $200,000 a shot [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=212.34s)]
*  with a $300,000 command launch unit, the Ukrainians can only use that for the first shot in an [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  ambush because their IR detector, if they shoot the first tank, the tank is very hot. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=227.22s)]
*  It's burning. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=233.14s)]
*  If they try to shoot a second and third missile, the other missiles go for the very hot spot [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=234.17999999999998s)]
*  on the battlefield. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=238.42s)]
*  They can't even discern. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=239.05999999999997s)]
*  So then the Ukrainians shift from a $200,000 missile from the Americans to one that they [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=240.33999999999997s)]
*  build themselves for $29,000. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=245.14s)]
*  And it works just as well. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=247.45999999999998s)]
*  And it's delivered on a drone. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  Delivered on a drone or from an anti-tank missiles. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=250.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  So the super high dollar American stuff is not doing so well in that battle space. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=252.89999999999998s)]
*  So I would assume, I mean, the world is watching this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=259.78s)]
*  Potential future adversaries are seeing on display American military capability. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=263.61999999999995s)]
*  And we should be concerned as taxpayers and as citizens that all this money we've spent, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=271.05999999999995s)]
*  we have not gotten very good value for in the same way. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  But doesn't it, doesn't it display our vulnerability too? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=281.05999999999995s)]
*  If our weapons systems aren't working in Ukraine, why would they work in other parts of the world? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=284.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=289.3s)]
*  Aren't we sort of showing our hand? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  Look, some of the stuff works well, but at what cost? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=291.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=294.5s)]
*  Because, you know, the Houthis are using a 20 to $50,000 drone to attack commercial [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=295.14s)]
*  shipping or US shipping in the Red Sea Gulf of Aden. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=301.14s)]
*  And the US has to shoot that down with not one, but two missiles that cost $2 million a piece. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=306.1s)]
*  So you're costing us $4 million to shoot down a $50,000 drone. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=312.1s)]
*  Bad math. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=316.42s)]
*  So even in Washington, DC. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=317.22s)]
*  Why wouldn't, because this is on display and the world is sort of watching, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=318.42s)]
*  why wouldn't military planners in the United States be taking notes and adjusting accordingly? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=322.98s)]
*  Because the money flow keeps on going the same way with no accountability and no [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=328.82s)]
*  self-introspection, no learning. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=336.42s)]
*  Look, who got fired, who got punished for a complete debacle in Afghanistan where [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=338.26s)]
*  over 20 years we replaced the Taliban with the Taliban. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=344.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=350.82s)]
*  And nobody's been fired. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=351.14s)]
*  The only guy that got fired was Stu Scheller. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=352.02s)]
*  What a good man he is. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=353.85999999999996s)]
*  The young Marine who stood up and said, enough. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=354.74s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=357.38s)]
*  Because if one of his Marines- [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=357.78s)]
*  But he went to jail. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=358.74s)]
*  Scheller went to jail. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=359.38s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=360.34s)]
*  Because he said, look, if a couple of my young Marines lost a rifle on the rifle range, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=361.38s)]
*  they would be punished. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=365.7s)]
*  We lost, we left 80 some billion dollars worth of military equipment and turned over the country [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=367.21999999999997s)]
*  to a terror organization and everybody's been promoted and everybody is just, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=371.85999999999996s)]
*  it's business as usual. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=377.61999999999995s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=379.46s)]
*  This kind of incompetence is not going to end well. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  So, I mean, I have too many questions and I do want to circle back to your initial point [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=383.85999999999996s)]
*  that warfare is completely different to step changes you said. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=388.9s)]
*  But how, on this thread, how does the US Congress, how do people who claim to [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=391.85999999999996s)]
*  support our troops, back the military, strong defense, the Liz Cheney wing of the Congress, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=398.02s)]
*  how do they keep sending money to an organization that's increasingly incapable of defending the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=404.26s)]
*  country? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=409.38s)]
*  I spoke to a bunch of members yesterday morning in Congress and they were at the point of despair [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=410.18s)]
*  because they're trying to restrict the money and to bring some accountability. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=417.3s)]
*  And they said the money is the amount of money that is sprinkled around [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=422.1s)]
*  the capital by the defense contractors, by effectively the brigade's worth of lobbyists, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=428.65999999999997s)]
*  thousands of lobbyists spreading tens of millions of dollars around politicians [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=433.38s)]
*  and they just keep the money train going. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=439.21999999999997s)]
*  It's really disgusting. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  And the big thing, in the article I wrote recently, I'd said, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=442.74s)]
*  like when the Romans lost a whole bunch of people at the Battle of Cannae, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=446.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=449.38s)]
*  when their Senate met a couple of weeks later, it was 40% undermanned. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=449.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=453.86s)]
*  Because the Roman elites actually served in the military and bore the consequences of failure. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=454.34s)]
*  Our elites don't serve in the military. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=460.98s)]
*  They have very little skin in the game or no skin. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  And so for them, it's about money and grift. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=466.18s)]
*  Or their children serve in foreign militaries. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=469.78s)]
*  So just back to the technology itself, which you've been watching all your life [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=472.41999999999996s)]
*  because you've been around it all your life. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=476.09999999999997s)]
*  I think you had the world's largest private air force at one point. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=478.09999999999997s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=480.5s)]
*  We had 73 aircraft that we owned and operated and flew into garden spots for the US. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=483.05999999999995s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=491.05999999999995s)]
*  So what I was just at a Blackwater reunion. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=493.38s)]
*  I was just at a Blackwater reunion. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=496.34s)]
*  So what I was just at a Blackwater reunion last weekend and we had it at the Alamo. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=498.09999999999997s)]
*  And it was just, it was really cool standing there on hallowed ground. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=506.65999999999997s)]
*  Because I didn't realize that across the street from the Alamo is the Menger bar. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=511.78s)]
*  And that's actually where Teddy Roosevelt started the Rough Riders. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=515.46s)]
*  So there's all kinds of Rough Rider memorabilia in this bar, raising a glass to a great American. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=520.1s)]
*  And if I'd convinced Trump to change policy in Afghanistan to prevent the debacle, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=525.6999999999999s)]
*  which ended up happening, I was going to call that unit the second US volunteer cavalry. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=530.3399999999999s)]
*  The first US volunteer cavalry was the Rough Riders. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=536.02s)]
*  Sam one hell. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=538.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=539.14s)]
*  This was going to be a two USV. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  It would have worked. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=542.02s)]
*  Afghanistan would be stable. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=543.2199999999999s)]
*  We would have saved America the embarrassment. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=544.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=547.62s)]
*  And really that I'd say a pivotal moment for a massive collapse in American credibility and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=548.68s)]
*  deterrence. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=554.6s)]
*  And it would have cost 5% of what the US was already spending. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=555.24s)]
*  So why couldn't I remember that very well? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=559.72s)]
*  And in my memory, you were not making the case for a forever occupation. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=562.52s)]
*  You were making the case for a sensible drawdown that didn't destroy the- [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=567.16s)]
*  All the conventional forces could have left. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=571.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=574.36s)]
*  90% of the contractors could have left. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=574.86s)]
*  There would have been a small stay behind special operations force, 6,000 contractors. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=577.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=582.14s)]
*  And we'd have kept accountability for the tens of billions of dollars of US equipment [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=583.58s)]
*  that was already there and would have kept the government upright. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=588.38s)]
*  And there's now every Al Qaeda, every crazy terrorist organization has set up shop there [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=591.1800000000001s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=599.02s)]
*  Again, we've not heard the last time that the US was going to be able to do that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=599.66s)]
*  We've not heard the last of Afghanistan. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=603.8199999999999s)]
*  It's really sad. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=605.8199999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=606.46s)]
*  Again, I remember that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=607.5s)]
*  In fact, I think we talked about it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=608.3s)]
*  I know we talked about it at the time. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=609.34s)]
*  And it seemed sensible. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=611.26s)]
*  It seemed kind of non-adiological, practical. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=612.78s)]
*  How do we get this as kind of a clusterfuck? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=614.86s)]
*  How do we get out in the best way possible? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=616.3s)]
*  Preserving our own interests to the extent that we can. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=618.6999999999999s)]
*  Why didn't the administration, the Trump administration, take you up on that? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=621.34s)]
*  I would say the same neocon perpetual war presence in Washington that wants to do it [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=626.3s)]
*  the same way that we've been doing for decades. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=631.58s)]
*  And I would argue losing doing that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=635.9000000000001s)]
*  It's about money and power and perpetuation, not about actually [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=639.58s)]
*  putting a bow on a bad situation. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=644.5400000000001s)]
*  How do those people, as they inevitably do, seize the moral high ground in the opening [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=646.7s)]
*  moments of the ideological battle and position themselves as the champions of freedom and human [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=652.5400000000001s)]
*  rights when in fact they're monsters? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=657.98s)]
*  Like how do they get away with that? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=659.9000000000001s)]
*  Every single time. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=661.18s)]
*  I think it's a direct result of the all-volunteer force, which seems a good idea. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=662.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm still supportive of it, but it means it's a very, the people that actually serve, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=668.2199999999999s)]
*  that bear the cost of these overseas efforts, maybe one half of 1% of the population serving. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=674.06s)]
*  Three or 4% know that 1%. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=681.02s)]
*  And then 95% of America has no clue and no skin in the game. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=684.06s)]
*  And so they're easily bullshitted by the posturing jackasses in Washington. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=687.58s)]
*  That's why Dan Crenshaw has a job. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=693.9000000000001s)]
*  So I just want to get back to the technology because I'm just, I'm interested on behalf of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=696.22s)]
*  all people who sense turmoil ahead and are, say, stockpiling ammo. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=700.46s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=705.58s)]
*  I think there are people like that. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=706.0600000000001s)]
*  Is that fruitless given the technologies? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=708.38s)]
*  I would argue for Taiwan, for example, facing a possible invasion or issue from coming from [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=710.22s)]
*  mainland China, the best thing they could do is build a home guard because a well-armed, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=717.5s)]
*  well-motivated people, I mean, as we showed in Afghanistan, as the Taliban showed the US military, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=724.14s)]
*  well-motivated people, even using weapons that are 70 years old, can still beat the superpowers. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  It's not the steel in the ships that make a great Navy. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=735.58s)]
*  It's the steel in the men, the steel in the crew. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=737.9000000000001s)]
*  But are you ever going to see another war between states that's won or lost on the basis of artillery [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=742.7s)]
*  tanks? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=751.58s)]
*  I mean, is that, are those the cavalry charges? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=753.82s)]
*  If you're going to see that, I mean, I think that's a good question. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=756.94s)]
*  I mean, is that, are those the cavalry charges of today? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=759.9799999999999s)]
*  Artillery is still the king of battle as the Ukrainians are learning the hard way. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=766.54s)]
*  The Russians have gone from, if you shot at the Russians a year and a half ago, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=769.9s)]
*  it would take them about an hour and a half to shoot back accurately, to geolocate and to [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=775.26s)]
*  coordinate with their fire control centers to shoot back. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=781.8199999999999s)]
*  Now they're down to about two or three minutes. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=785.9s)]
*  So they've learned and they're coordinating and they've gotten a lot better. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=788.7s)]
*  And it is wrong for us to assume that our Kung Fu is all that good right now. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=793.1s)]
*  And what role do drones play going forward, to the extent you can predict and imagine it? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=798.54s)]
*  Very significant. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=803.58s)]
*  People say the tank is dead, it's gone forever. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=806.14s)]
*  It will go just like chariots or the attack helicopter of 2,000 years ago. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=809.1800000000001s)]
*  There will still be a role for tanks, but people are going to have to figure out how to knock down [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=815.58s)]
*  the swarms of incoming drones with hard kill and soft kill, et cetera. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=818.7s)]
*  It is always going to, warfare is going to ebb and flow, but the ability to program [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=825.74s)]
*  very sophisticated devices that fly very fast, that are very hard to kill. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=830.46s)]
*  The first strategic offset after World War II was nuclear weapons. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=834.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=838.5400000000001s)]
*  We had nukes, then the Russians did, and then it was about tonnage. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=838.86s)]
*  Then the second offset was precision weaponry. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=842.06s)]
*  Now everybody has precision weaponry. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=845.7399999999999s)]
*  So I would argue that the third offset that the US should try to pursue dominance, and we're far from it, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=847.9799999999999s)]
*  is in an AI drone innovation application. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=855.42s)]
*  And I would say the most innovation that's happened has been in Ukraine and Russia right now, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=859.8199999999999s)]
*  and we are way behind. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=863.5s)]
*  Because again, Washington procurement people, the appropriate people, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=865.02s)]
*  the appropriate people in Congress keep spending money in the same way on the same stupid cartel [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=871.74s)]
*  of defense contractors with the same failing results. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=877.18s)]
*  When at the bleeding edge of battle, actual innovation is happening by dudes in their garage [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=881.82s)]
*  in Ukraine that are fighting for their lives, and they've innovated, and we ignore that to our detriment. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=887.82s)]
*  So these are countries with fewer marketing majors and more engineers coming out of Europe, right? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=895.5s)]
*  Marketing majors are bad at creating drones. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=901.9s)]
*  They've done well at STEM. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=903.7399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they have done well. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=904.9399999999999s)]
*  And they're smart people, which no one wants to say, but it's true. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=906.3s)]
*  You may have come to the obvious conclusion that the real debate is not between Republican [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=909.18s)]
*  and Democrat or socialist and capitalist, right, left. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=913.02s)]
*  The real battle is between people who are lying on purpose and people who are trying to tell you [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=918.38s)]
*  the truth. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=923.66s)]
*  It's between good and evil. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=924.54s)]
*  It's between honesty and falsehood. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=926.06s)]
*  And we hope we are on the former side. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=928.8599999999999s)]
*  That's why we created this network, the Tucker Carlson Network, and we invite you to subscribe [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=931.5799999999999s)]

*  You will not regret it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=950.06s)]
*  What can what will drones be able to do? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=951.8199999999999s)]
*  Do you think going in 10 years? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=954.06s)]
*  What will that look like? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=956.06s)]
*  You could load a face and between network surveillance and the facial recognition on [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=957.1s)]
*  that drone, find one person and fly into that person's head that fast. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=964.22s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=969.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=970.0600000000001s)]
*  So identity management, privacy will become even more essential. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=970.3000000000001s)]
*  You think about how many cameras, how much data is being constantly collected everywhere [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=977.0200000000001s)]

*  Oh yeah. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=995.98s)]
*  Well, I've noticed and now TSA has decided to take your photograph every time you walk [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=996.38s)]
*  through. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1001.98s)]
*  I went through yesterday and they had a, you know, stare into the screen and will assess [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1002.78s)]
*  your face. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1007.02s)]
*  I said to the guy, is this mandatory? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1007.5s)]
*  And he said, no, it's not. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1009.74s)]
*  And I said, fuck that. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1012.38s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1013.34s)]
*  And he goes, I agree with you. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1013.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1017.74s)]
*  I mean, but like, what is that? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1018.14s)]
*  Why are they doing that? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1019.42s)]
*  Data aggregation because they can. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1022.7s)]
*  So it's not a good sign when your own government is gathering data on you, is it? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1026.38s)]
*  Why would they possibly need that? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1033.18s)]
*  Well, think about what chipped our founding fathers off. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1034.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1039.34s)]
*  Paying some taxes on tea and land taxes. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1039.82s)]
*  And I mean, I guess our idea of what we will resist over in terms of liberty and government [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1043.1s)]
*  intrusion has been very steadily eroding. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1050.78s)]
*  And now it's, I would say increasingly a steep curve of descent. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1054.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1060.4599999999998s)]
*  And it does seem like the purpose of politicizing the military and making it left wing, anti-white, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1060.86s)]
*  pro-trans, all this stuff, which I think the right just sort of says, well, that's going [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1066.3s)]
*  to be less effective military. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1069.98s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1071.1000000000001s)]
*  They make fun of it. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1071.5s)]
*  But that seems way darker to me. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1073.18s)]
*  I mean, it does seem like it's being weaponized against descent in the United States. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1075.9s)]
*  I think the military was one of the most trusted institutions. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1083.42s)]
*  For sure. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1087.5s)]
*  And I saw already even in the 80s, I mean, look, I went to the Naval Academy in [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1089.34s)]
*  1987 and I left after a year and a half because I found the political correctness and the [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1095.9s)]
*  nonsense already then on the double standards that were pursued by the Academy leadership [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1100.78s)]
*  while saying there are no double standards. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1108.78s)]
*  I just found ridiculous. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1110.86s)]
*  What were the double standards? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1112.86s)]
*  I remember going to the O course the first time and they said this was one height of a wall to [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1115.18s)]
*  get over for one gender and one height for the other one. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1121.98s)]
*  And they said, oh, the standards are all the same. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1123.98s)]
*  But wait a minute. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1126.06s)]
*  They're liars. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1126.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1128.06s)]
*  So just let's, if you're going to call it the same, then be the same, but let's be consistent. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1128.3s)]
*  And so the amount of recruiting for specific sports teams of people that were completely [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1134.06s)]
*  unqualified to be there or to be naval officers was staggering. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1140.38s)]
*  I love the Navy. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1144.38s)]
*  I just didn't like a school run by the federal government. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1145.66s)]
*  I didn't fully realize it. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1151.42s)]
*  So you made it through the first year where people drop out. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1152.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1156.62s)]
*  No, I left halfway through my sophomore year. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1157.58s)]
*  I finished my finals. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1160.1399999999999s)]
*  So you did the hard stuff and you still dropped out. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1161.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1164.3799999999999s)]
*  It's not that hard. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1164.62s)]
*  It's just, you have to have a high tolerance for bullshit. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1165.42s)]
*  That's all. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1168.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1170.62s)]
*  That's dropped in you. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1170.86s)]
*  I notice. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1171.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1172.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1173.42s)]
*  But I rolled to Hillsdale. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1175.18s)]
*  So, you know, went quite the opposite to one run by the federal government to one that accepted [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1177.26s)]
*  no federal funding at all. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1181.5s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1183.74s)]
*  So even in 1987, why didn't anyone say anything about it? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1185.02s)]
*  Because women don't fight different wars. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1188.62s)]
*  Presumably it would be the same war. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1190.22s)]
*  So that's like very obviously insane. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1192.06s)]
*  Look, I had no issue with women being at the academies, but at least make equal enforcement. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1194.86s)]
*  That's all. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1201.98s)]
*  If it's going to be, you're going to call it the same, then be the same. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1203.02s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1205.74s)]
*  And you, but I, what I also found, I went to Hillsdale and I joined the fire department. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1206.22s)]
*  Of the local town. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1211.26s)]
*  And I learned more about small unit leadership there than I did in the very artificial learning [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1212.6200000000001s)]
*  lab that was the academy. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1217.98s)]
*  Why'd you join the fire department in college? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1219.18s)]
*  Because it was cool. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1220.78s)]
*  Because it was fun. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1221.74s)]
*  Come on. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1222.46s)]
*  I got to do a lot of things in life, but driving a fire truck to a fire lights and sirens is [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1222.8600000000001s)]
*  definitely in the top five. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1227.9s)]
*  How many kids in your class were in the fire department? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1229.1000000000001s)]
*  None. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1232.22s)]
*  Since then, it's been more of a thing, but I was the first one ever at Hillsdale to join [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1233.82s)]
*  the fire department. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1237.18s)]
*  And it was convincing the gruff firefighters and it was a full-time part-time. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1237.98s)]
*  So there was a couple of full-time guys, but the rest were like a butcher and a [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1244.7s)]
*  trash truck driver and building contractors. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1249.34s)]
*  So convincing them that this snot nose college kid was okay to go through a burning building [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1251.9s)]
*  with them was, it was no small admissions process. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1257.5s)]
*  One of the things I think is most interesting about you, which I know you hate to talk about, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1261.34s)]
*  but is the fact that you were from an affluent family and so you didn't actually need to [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1264.22s)]
*  do any of that at all. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1268.46s)]
*  So why did you do that? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1270.22s)]
*  Sense of mission, sense of service, and mostly a sense of adventure. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1274.94s)]
*  So you never thought like, you know, we're rich. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1279.82s)]
*  I don't need to, this is just nonsense. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1282.22s)]
*  I'm going to. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1283.98s)]
*  No, that was never. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1285.18s)]
*  Bummer on Europe for the summer. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1286.14s)]
*  Never part of the equation. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1287.66s)]
*  Why? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1289.18s)]
*  No, I didn't know. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1289.5s)]
*  I did. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1290.94s)]
*  I got married between my junior and senior year and I took a long honeymoon and we went [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1291.82s)]
*  through Eastern Europe. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1297.4199999999998s)]
*  But the funny thing is we. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1298.7s)]
*  Went through Eastern Europe. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1301.1799999999998s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1302.1399999999999s)]
*  That was 91. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1303.26s)]
*  That was as the whole Soviet Union was. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1304.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I got married that year. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1306.22s)]
*  I remember. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1307.26s)]
*  And we went to, we went on the Baltic liberation tour with Pat Buchanan and Lou Rockwell from [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1308.22s)]
*  the Vimesis Institute. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1314.22s)]
*  And we went to Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1315.58s)]
*  And we visited the government buildings, which were still surrounded and occupied by Soviet [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1319.74s)]
*  interior ministry troops, but they'd had free elections. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1324.7s)]
*  It's always fascinating to see a place literally at the inflection point of embracing. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1327.42s)]
*  What month in 91 was this? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1331.34s)]
*  That was May. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1333.66s)]
*  Okay, so I got married that summer also and I went to the Midocean Club in Tuckerstown, Bermuda. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1335.02s)]
*  It seemed more romantic than Estonia. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1340.94s)]
*  What did your wife think? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1343.02s)]
*  Your young bride think when you're like, we're getting married, but actually the honeymoon [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1343.8999999999999s)]
*  Eastern Europe, it's like the hellscape of Eastern Europe. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1348.1399999999999s)]
*  Honey, do you know anything about Stalinist architecture? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1351.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm going to show you. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1352.86s)]
*  We road trip through, but it was really funny. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1353.82s)]
*  I'll never forget. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1356.1399999999999s)]
*  Bay Buchanan bought an entire uniform off of a Soviet border guard, a captain, for 20 bucks. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1358.3s)]
*  And we were at a restaurant and it comes back with a whole uniform on the hanger and 20 bucks. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1365.6599999999999s)]
*  And as we're leaving the country, another one of our group had a luggage that you have [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1370.46s)]
*  to put through the scanner. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1374.3s)]
*  You can see in the scanner, it looks like there's a manhole cover in his suitcase. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1378.46s)]
*  There's this huge disk. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1382.06s)]
*  The Soviet border guard opens the thing. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1384.06s)]
*  This is a very big problem. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1385.82s)]
*  How much to make the problem go away? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1388.54s)]
*  $50. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1390.46s)]
*  It was an entire bronze bust of linen that had been yanked off a building. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1391.5s)]
*  And our friend was exporting it. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1395.26s)]
*  So I thought, you know, if they're selling linen for $50 off a government building, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1397.98s)]
*  this is not long for communism. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1401.74s)]
*  In fact, it was, I think it was in August of that year. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1403.5800000000002s)]
*  It was two months later it was done. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1405.5800000000002s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1406.94s)]
*  So my final question about the drones. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1409.5s)]
*  I mean, is it a crazy thing to consider the possibility that the government might employ [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1412.3000000000002s)]
*  this technology against its own citizens, deploy it against those citizens? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1419.42s)]
*  If they're putting people, if people are still rotting in prison for protesting at [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1422.54s)]
*  the Capitol on January 6th, if they're putting a woman got four years in prison yesterday [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1426.3000000000002s)]
*  for protesting outside an abortion clinic, it's a government at war with its own citizens. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1431.82s)]
*  So why wouldn't drones be part of that? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1436.54s)]
*  Entirely possible. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1440.86s)]
*  How hard are they to shoot down with say a 12 gauge? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1442.06s)]
*  That's actually one of the it's a big problem for the small FPV drones. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1445.74s)]
*  They're so small and small hard, so hard to hit. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1449.4199999999998s)]
*  It's almost like hitting a, a tarmigan. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1451.6599999999999s)]
*  Very hard to hit that bird. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1454.54s)]
*  Very fast. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1455.74s)]
*  Very fast. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1456.62s)]
*  I know you love bird hunting. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1457.5s)]
*  I do. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1458.54s)]
*  I try to correlate it to, you know, or maybe a very like a quail on cocaine. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1459.02s)]
*  Oh, it's that tough. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1463.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1464.78s)]
*  It sounds kind of sporty. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1465.02s)]
*  So what is the defense? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1466.3s)]
*  So if nets, net nets, nets are, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1467.5s)]
*  nets are a cheap, simple defense for small FPV drones because it's a small charge. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1472.46s)]
*  If you can keep the charge away from the target, the small charge doesn't have that much effect. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1477.1000000000001s)]
*  But, you know, P for plenty, you can always increase the poundage. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1482.6200000000001s)]
*  My sense is that police departments and state police have drones now. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1486.46s)]
*  For surveillance. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1491.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1492.22s)]
*  For surveillance. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1492.8600000000001s)]
*  How hard is it to, to alter a surveillance drone to become an offensive weapon? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1493.5s)]
*  Well, the Ukrainians and the Russians have done that in their garages or in a tent on [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1499.82s)]
*  the edge of battle pretty easily. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1504.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1506.7s)]
*  So why wouldn't, I mean, if you care about living in a non totalitarian country, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1507.18s)]
*  if you care about America, why wouldn't someone say, actually, no, we're not, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1512.7s)]
*  we're just going to pass a federal law that no law enforcement or Intel agency or the [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1515.98s)]
*  U S military, these things could not be used domestically against Americans period. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1520.9399999999998s)]
*  Under any circumstances. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1524.86s)]
*  Or certainly not armed. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1525.6599999999999s)]
*  Or surveillance. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1527.6599999999999s)]
*  Like, why do you need, you know what I mean? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1528.46s)]
*  Look, for, for stopping a mass shooter or some actual terrorism event, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1530.86s)]
*  it provides good situation awareness and it protects the cops who are trying to do an honest job. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1537.74s)]
*  But the, the, the leakage in the same way that the forever wars of Iraq or Afghanistan [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1542.22s)]
*  and all those surveillance tools that the government tells us they need to protect us. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1548.38s)]
*  The, the danger is certainly some of that tech on the arm side leaking back to be used [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1553.1000000000001s)]
*  domestically. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1557.66s)]
*  That's a, I don't see any effort by the U S government to stop mass shootings. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1558.22s)]
*  In fact, they seem to be abetting them and time and time again, you find in the small print [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1562.06s)]
*  in the right up after the shooting that the person has been detained repeatedly by some branch of [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1568.3s)]
*  government. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1575.6599999999999s)]
*  You saw in Uvalde, the cops refused to go in and save the kids as they were being executed, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1575.98s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1579.18s)]
*  There just doesn't seem any will to stop mass shootings. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1579.8999999999999s)]
*  There seems to be instead. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1582.7s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't see that. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1584.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't, the Uvalde one was not a, I wouldn't say that's not a top down federal conspiracy. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1585.1s)]
*  That was individual inadequacy of training and readiness. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1590.78s)]
*  Cause there's, there's dozens of other ones where the cops have just been spectacular, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1595.42s)]
*  like in Nashville. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1599.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1600.38s)]
*  But then you see the political correctness of them being reluctant to release the, the, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1601.42s)]
*  the writings of this trans shooter who is out to kill Christians. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1608.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1613.02s)]
*  So great individual valor by those cops, bad by the cop leadership or the law enforcement [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1614.06s)]
*  leadership by not releasing the truth. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1620.46s)]
*  Let's have a massive disinfecting effect of truth on this situation. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1622.7s)]
*  So for sure, but there's no will obviously in the media to get to that information. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1628.14s)]
*  So it's left to like people on X to do it. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1632.6200000000001s)]
*  But I mean, you've been in and around the government since you were 18 and shipped off [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1634.7s)]
*  to Annapolis. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1639.5s)]
*  So do you think it's fair for the rest of us who haven't to be skeptical of massive [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1640.6200000000001s)]
*  increases in government power, particularly military and law enforcement power that are [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1646.6200000000001s)]
*  justified by some threat? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1650.94s)]
*  Like we should be highly skeptical. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1653.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1655.5s)]
*  Mass shooters, child molesters, human traffickers, Islamic terrorists. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1656.78s)]
*  Like I don't think the government does a good job of protecting us from any of those things, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1661.1000000000001s)]
*  but they've certainly increased their power and their power to kill me and my family on [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1665.42s)]
*  the basis of those threats. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1669.66s)]
*  More on poverty, more poverty. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1670.78s)]
*  More on drugs, more drugs. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1672.94s)]
*  More on terrorism. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1675.18s)]
*  Didn't go so well. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1676.8600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1677.98s)]
*  And just to that, I know we're jumping around, but I have too many questions. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1679.44s)]
*  But maybe we both suffer from a little ADD. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1683.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1685.68s)]
*  Well, I mean, there's just a lot to go through. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1686.16s)]
*  So you were at the center of the war on terror more than any other American, I would say. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1688.0s)]
*  Well, how? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1693.68s)]
*  I mean, we had our shoulder to the wheel pushing like everybody else. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1694.4s)]
*  But the scale was, you know, I don't think there's ever been a more effective military [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1699.2s)]
*  contractor in a war that I'm aware of in the United States than Blackwater, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1705.28s)]
*  which you started and ran. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1709.12s)]
*  So, but, you know, you were subject to the policymakers as well. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1710.6399999999999s)]
*  And as in the Afghanistan withdrawal, not one of them, not only was not like indicted or punished, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1715.76s)]
*  but not a single one of them sort of lost a step in career advancement. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1721.52s)]
*  They all kind of went on to the Atlantic Council or whatever. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1725.04s)]
*  Or their board seats. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1727.68s)]
*  Or their board seats. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1728.8s)]
*  On the big defense contractors. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1729.52s)]
*  So how, since you watched that, how did that happen? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1730.8799999999999s)]
*  How did Toria Nuland go from Dick Cheney's office to being like the number two person [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1734.4s)]
*  in the State Department overseeing the war in Ukraine? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1738.96s)]
*  Like, that's just crazy to me. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1741.2s)]
*  Because it's at that, it's almost a uniparty. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1745.36s)]
*  It is the party of big government in big Washington and more spending and more warfare. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1749.6s)]
*  And 100% wrong. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1756.24s)]
*  The guys that you serve with in the SEAL teams and that, you know, who you've been around [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1757.76s)]
*  in the subsequent 30 years, like how do they feel about that? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1763.6s)]
*  Like guys who did, you know, three or four deployments or more. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1766.24s)]
*  The guys that actually paid the cost. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1769.2s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1770.8s)]
*  Of bad policymaker decisions. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1771.36s)]
*  You know, where their friends commit suicide and they didn't get to see their kids grow up, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1773.04s)]
*  or they got killed or lost a limb. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1775.92s)]
*  Like those guys. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1777.36s)]
*  Yep. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1778.08s)]
*  What do they think? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1778.6399999999999s)]
*  They're disgusted. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1779.36s)]
*  They're angry. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1780.24s)]
*  They're righteously angry. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1782.08s)]
*  They're righteously angry because they believe in the Republic. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1784.08s)]
*  When you join the military, you swear to defend the Constitution against all enemies, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1788.56s)]
*  foreign and domestic. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1792.8799999999999s)]
*  And you kind of join thinking all those enemies are going to be abroad, but some of the enemies [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1794.32s)]
*  of liberty are probably here. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1799.6s)]
*  And when an elite enriches themselves and separates them from the realities of consequences [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1802.08s)]
*  of accountability, that's a pendulum that swings [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1809.2s)]
*  out far, but nature has a way of swinging the pendulum back to the middle. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1813.36s)]
*  And so that either it gets done in within the rule of law and accountability or things [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1817.04s)]
*  can come apart very quickly. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1822.72s)]
*  Frighteningly. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1825.52s)]
*  Part of the accountability is informal. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1826.6399999999999s)]
*  It's social pressure, which is very effective. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1828.56s)]
*  Shame. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1830.6399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1831.6s)]
*  And humor. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1832.32s)]
*  We need, first of all, we need to just laugh at the freaking incompetence. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1833.36s)]
*  I'd say when you, when you track, um, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1837.36s)]
*  I made the last deployment on the USS America, an old, uh, it was a fuel fired aircraft carrier. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1841.04s)]
*  And they used to, uh, everything is measured on an aircraft carrier, especially the landings [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1849.12s)]
*  because it's all about the aviators and who has the best launch and recovery, especially [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1855.12s)]
*  the, you know, the traps. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1858.8s)]
*  So they measure which, which wire you catch and everything. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1859.52s)]
*  So once a month, there's a thing called the folks will follies, which is the front of [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1862.3999999999999s)]
*  the ship below the flight deck where the chains come out of the belly. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1867.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1872.48s)]
*  And so all the air wing and the senior ship's crew would muster there and they'd go through [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1874.08s)]
*  all the scores, but then it would go through the most merciful, merciless roasting of anybody. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1879.3600000000001s)]
*  It was the most vicious humor I've ever seen in my life. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1886.88s)]
*  Like guys who screwed up the landings. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1891.52s)]
*  Screwed up the landings, the XO, the CEO. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1893.28s)]
*  It was no holds barred. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1896.24s)]
*  It was fantastic. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1898.0s)]
*  It was hilarious and very healthy. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1899.04s)]
*  And, but now that you've, you have a much more politically correct military, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1902.0s)]
*  you can't do that at all. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1906.64s)]
*  They don't do that anymore. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1909.2s)]
*  Nope. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1910.32s)]
*  No, but I mean, if, if you can't land an aircraft on a pitching deck of an aircraft carrier, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1911.68s)]
*  I mean, you put your own life, the hardware and the lives of the sailors at risk. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1920.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1924.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1925.52s)]
*  So the stakes could not be higher. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1926.56s)]
*  High stakes, very important mission, literally lives in the line and it's good to, to reinforce [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1928.48s)]
*  good behavior and to punish bad behavior and, and, and shame and derision of your peers [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1937.2s)]
*  matters. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1944.96s)]
*  So looking back, since again, you were so close to what was happening during that whole period, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1946.0s)]
*  or at least until maybe 2012, but for the critical years, you were like right there. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1952.48s)]
*  Who, who do you blame most for the mistakes made in Afghanistan and Iraq and the subsequent wars? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1957.04s)]
*  Who were the villains? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1965.1200000000001s)]
*  Who shouldn't get board seats? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1965.84s)]
*  Look, any, we went through like 18 different commanders, 18 different four star generals [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1968.88s)]
*  over the course of Afghanistan. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1975.2s)]
*  A lot of four star generals. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1976.24s)]
*  We have as many generals now as we did in World War II. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1978.24s)]
*  When we had 14 million men under arms. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1982.8s)]
*  So now you have 10% of that. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1986.0s)]
*  So you have basically 1.4 million under arms versus 14. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1988.48s)]
*  And we have the same amount of flag officers. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1992.48s)]
*  So yeah, we are massively overstaffed and you think about all the, and this, I mean, they have. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=1994.24s)]
*  All chiefs and no Indians. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2001.2s)]
*  Each four star general has a personal butler and a valet and a driver and a cook and all those kind [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2003.28s)]
*  of quaint 18th century habits of staff that they surrounded military generals with. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2010.96s)]
*  We have that yet for our generals. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2017.2s)]
*  Back when generals were brave though, generals got killed in the civil war. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2018.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2022.16s)]
*  And not so much now. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2023.2s)]
*  So it's just, it's just enormous. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2026.48s)]
*  There can be a massive winnowing of head count across the board in generals, in staffs, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2030.16s)]
*  and in civilians, the tooth to tail ratio of the military of like how many, when you say teeth, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2038.32s)]
*  people that put warheads on foreheads versus tail has gotten way out of whack. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2044.3999999999999s)]
*  We have way too much tail, like an alligator sized tail with a salamander size bite. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2050.3199999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2056.56s)]
*  Just, it's so unbelievably corrupt. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2057.12s)]
*  So, but, but again, but again, no, it's, it's, it's corrupt because we just keep throwing money [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2059.04s)]
*  at it and no one ever calls bullshit. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2065.36s)]
*  A business that goes through a massive growth cycle. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2067.36s)]
*  Everybody can get fat and sloppy and lazy because you just, there's always more money [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2072.4s)]
*  and there's, we never have to tighten a belt. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2076.8s)]
*  And so the, the U S military has been on like a, a, um, crispy cream bender of donuts, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2078.48s)]
*  compounding amount of donuts consumed every day. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2088.5600000000004s)]
*  And no one's ever tightened them up and saying, all right, today we're just PT and we're not [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2091.6800000000003s)]
*  eating donuts. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2095.6s)]
*  That's across our entire government, but especially in the military, which is supposed [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2097.2s)]
*  to exist constitutionally to defend and deter. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2102.16s)]
*  And, and I don't think we're, we're not getting the money that we're spending. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2105.12s)]
*  We're not getting the value that we're spending money on right now. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2109.04s)]
*  No, it seems we're at a point where it's dangerous. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2111.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2113.12s)]
*  And it does seem, I just want to restate it. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2114.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know this as a desert in fact, but I can feel it very strongly. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2116.88s)]
*  I think the purpose of it is to keep, you know, I think, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2120.64s)]
*  I think the enemy that they're seeking to fight lives here. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2123.28s)]
*  I mean, I think this is a political, I think the policy makers feel that way. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2126.1600000000003s)]
*  They're very anxious to control any instrument of force. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2130.32s)]
*  I would argue it's about for, for the defense contractors, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2134.6400000000003s)]
*  they just want to keep selling expensive weapons. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2142.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2144.0800000000004s)]
*  And they will keep paying politicians to keep buying the expensive weapons. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2145.44s)]
*  I almost feel, I don't feel sad for the, for the White House as they deal with a problem, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2149.12s)]
*  like in Yemen, where the Houthis have become long range pirates [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2155.52s)]
*  and have shut off the entire Red Sea. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2159.2799999999997s)]
*  Like 50% of global container traffic flowed through the Red Sea. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2161.52s)]
*  Now it doesn't. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2165.12s)]
*  Egypt is losing $800 million a month in lost toll fees from, from container traffic. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2166.3199999999997s)]
*  And all those ships have to go all the way around South Africa now to make it to Europe [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2173.7599999999998s)]
*  coming out of Asia. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2178.08s)]
*  It's a big problem. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2179.6s)]
*  And I'm sure the Navy, the, or the, the, the, the DOD policy makers [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2181.04s)]
*  only provide the administration with the 50 and a hundred billion dollar solution [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2185.84s)]
*  to go beat down the Houthis to make them behave. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2192.56s)]
*  And in that article I wrote, I just come back to there is such a constant rejection of market based [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2197.04s)]
*  private sector solutions because the Saudis and the Israelis actually had this problem back in the [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2204.16s)]
*  sixties when there was a war in Yemen and they hired David Sterling, the founder of the SAS. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2209.44s)]
*  And he went there with 30 guys and they kicked ass and it worked and it was cheap and simple [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2217.12s)]
*  and practical. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2222.72s)]
*  And, and this article I wrote just is a litany of those kinds of rejections. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2223.44s)]
*  And that's my frustration because I provided a lot of those options even to deter the Ukraine [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2230.08s)]
*  war in the first place. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2235.68s)]
*  You know, when it's pretty, I, I, my internal Intel sources gave me pretty good idea that already in [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2237.36s)]
*  December of 21, three months before the invasion, that the Russians are going to invade that it was [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2247.12s)]
*  not a, it was not a song and dance. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2252.24s)]
*  And so I wrote a paper proposing a combination of land lease and flying tigers to deter the war [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2255.6s)]
*  because in 1940 when Britain was really in it, the U S gave 50 destroyers, a bunch of aircraft, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2263.3599999999997s)]
*  guns, gave it to the Brits. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2270.3999999999996s)]
*  We also provided aircraft and allowed U S pilots to take leave and go to work for the [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2273.2s)]
*  nationalist Chinese to stop the Japanese from bombing cities called the flying tigers. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2278.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2283.52s)]
*  In this case, and we are I'm Stalin. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2284.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2286.9599999999996s)]
*  And made it possible to go from Moscow to, to Berlin to, to stop the Nazis. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2287.52s)]
*  But Biden could have done one very simple thing. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2292.8799999999997s)]
*  He could have announced, okay, no war necessary in Ukraine. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2298.4799999999996s)]
*  They're never going to join part of NATO, but they're at least going to have an air force [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2302.56s)]
*  because there was already 200 aircraft set to retire from the U S air force to be flown to the [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2306.56s)]
*  desert in 2022 50 F 15 50 F 16, some eight tens already written down to zero value to the taxpayer. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2312.4s)]
*  They're going to be flown to the desert, to the bone yard and parked for eternity. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2321.12s)]
*  Transfer those to the Ukrainians would have been less than a billion dollars, prevent the war [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2325.12s)]
*  and the discussion of NATO done. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2331.84s)]
*  But they wanted the war obviously. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2333.6s)]
*  Apparently. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2336.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2336.96s)]
*  Or they believe their own bullshit that they, that their power points and their posturing [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2337.76s)]
*  would dissuade. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2344.88s)]
*  Look, I understand why the Russians get ornery about it because if, if the Russians, the Chinese [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2346.32s)]
*  were looking to make the Northern provinces of Mexico into active parts of a Chinese or [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2352.56s)]
*  Russian Alliance, we'd get ornery about that. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2359.52s)]
*  Well, obviously. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2362.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2363.52s)]
*  They're putting, if they put, you know, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2363.76s)]
*  look at what happened when they put missiles in Cuba in 1962. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2365.92s)]
*  But missiles in Tijuana, it would be unacceptable. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2368.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2370.7200000000003s)]
*  So my question is, and this is all complex and delicate and, you know, I understand to some [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2371.44s)]
*  extent, but what I don't understand is sending Kamala Harris to the Munich security conference [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2377.28s)]
*  and saying at a press briefing with cameras rolling to Zelensky, we want you to join NATO. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2382.16s)]
*  You only say that if you want a war, you want the Russians to invade. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2388.0s)]
*  Like, why would they want that? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2390.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe they're just that dumb. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2391.76s)]
*  I don't think, and I think they are dumb. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2400.96s)]
*  I mean, they're, well, they're definitely, Tony Blinken. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2402.88s)]
*  I mean, really dumb. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2405.28s)]
*  Having a rock concert in Kiev during massive combat operations, while the Ukrainian army [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2406.88s)]
*  is getting crushed, he just, he just visited and he's up there on stage. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2413.28s)]
*  He's up there on stage with his guitar. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2418.88s)]
*  It's like that is Nero fiddling while Rome burns. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2420.64s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2423.2799999999997s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, he's a child, obviously, and like an angry, destructive child. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2435.8399999999997s)]
*  But what happens? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2442.48s)]
*  Like, where does this go? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2444.48s)]
*  We send another $60 billion to Ukraine. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2445.52s)]
*  Most of that money goes to five major US defense contractors to replace at five times the cost [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2447.52s)]
*  with the weapons costs that we already sent the Ukrainians. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2455.28s)]
*  Meaning, you know, if we send them something that was built 10 years ago, well, now it's [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2457.6s)]
*  going to cost four and five times as much. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2461.36s)]
*  So again, it's a massive grift paid by a Pentagon that doesn't know how to buy stuff [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2463.6800000000003s)]
*  cost effectively. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2468.32s)]
*  It doesn't change the outcome on the battle. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2469.1200000000003s)]
*  As the fields dry, it's May now, coming up on tank season. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2471.68s)]
*  The- [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2477.12s)]
*  Oh, is it tank season again? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2478.08s)]
*  Weather still matters in warfare. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2480.08s)]
*  And, you know, if you have a wet snow covered farm field, it's very muddy, very gooey, not [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2482.8799999999997s)]
*  great for tanks. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2492.3199999999997s)]
*  Mud season. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2493.2799999999997s)]
*  Mud season. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2493.9199999999996s)]
*  I think the Russians call it the great rasputitsa, the great slush. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2494.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2498.56s)]
*  That's done now. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2499.12s)]
*  And as June comes, it'll be game on. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2499.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think the Russian bear is hungry and they're going to have a time. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2503.8399999999997s)]
*  So the war should have been ended, never should have started. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2508.0s)]
*  They should have made a deal, froze the lines six months into it. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2511.8399999999997s)]
*  But the Biden administration believed that all this American weaponry would have saved [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2516.48s)]
*  the day. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2525.2s)]
*  It hasn't. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2525.6s)]
*  And it's ugly. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2526.4s)]
*  And, you know, the Russian commanders are not idiots. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2527.52s)]
*  They know their history. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2532.8s)]
*  The Battle of Kursk, which happened just north of where the fighting is now, was the largest [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2534.08s)]
*  tank battle in history. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2538.88s)]
*  It was the last offensive effort of the German army against the Soviets. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2539.84s)]
*  And they tried to push from the north and south on this salient. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2545.36s)]
*  It was a bulge. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2549.36s)]
*  And the Russians knew they were coming. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2550.96s)]
*  And so they built lots of lines of defenses. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2552.48s)]
*  It's the same thing they did last summer, which ate up all that equipment. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2554.56s)]
*  And now the Ukrainians are very thin. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2559.76s)]
*  They've had a lot of corruption issues. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2562.8s)]
*  All the defenses that were supposed to be built by the Ukrainians are much smaller or [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2564.4s)]
*  nonexistent. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2568.1600000000003s)]
*  And so now it's allowing maneuver. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2569.36s)]
*  And especially as the fields dry and you can maneuver, it's going to be a very ugly [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2571.28s)]
*  situation. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2576.32s)]
*  I'd say now they want to absolutely humiliate the West and make sure that they never have [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2577.2s)]
*  a problem with Ukraine again. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2581.8399999999997s)]
*  That seems achievable. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2585.04s)]
*  I'm afraid so. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2586.56s)]
*  What happens to Ukraine? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2588.56s)]
*  I don't know if it survives as an independent country. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2590.56s)]
*  If they take Odessa, if they take the ability for Ukraine to export its grain, they're going [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2593.04s)]
*  to have to do it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2598.56s)]
*  And they're going to have to do it. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2600.56s)]
*  And they're going to have to do it. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2602.56s)]
*  If they take the ability for Ukraine to export its grain, that really threatens the long-term [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2604.64s)]
*  economic viability. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2610.88s)]
*  Western Ukraine used to be part of Poland. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2614.4s)]
*  Eastern Ukraine used to be part of Russia. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2617.6s)]
*  So maps move depending on military victories drive diplomatic breakthroughs. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2620.16s)]
*  And right now the Russians are winning and they're going to have a very good summer. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2628.24s)]
*  Is there anybody who's knowledgeable on the subject who believes Ukraine can quote win, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2631.68s)]
*  which is to say push Russian troops all the way back to the old Russian border? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2636.08s)]
*  Well, I didn't really believe it ever. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2642.08s)]
*  I know that. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2644.4s)]
*  But I don't know who's advising the White House at this point or who they're listening [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2645.92s)]
*  to, but they probably need to change out their advisor list. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2651.6s)]
*  But then you have the Secretary of State, or Befunish Secretary of State Tony Blinken, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2656.2400000000002s)]
*  boomer parody, showing up and telling the Ukrainians during his rock concert that, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2663.92s)]
*  you know, we're with you forever. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2668.5600000000004s)]
*  Like, how could you say something like that when I've never met a single person who knows [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2670.0s)]
*  anything about the region who thinks Ukrainians will achieve victory no matter how much money [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2674.32s)]
*  we send them? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2678.0s)]
*  How could you say something like that? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2679.0400000000004s)]
*  It's good money after bad. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2680.5600000000004s)]
*  All we're doing now is facilitating the demise of Ukrainian men and destroying them for future [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2682.16s)]
*  generations. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2689.04s)]
*  So how many have died? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2689.6s)]
*  I've asked members of Congress who are funding this stuff. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2690.48s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2693.2799999999997s)]
*  Here's what I understand. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2695.8399999999997s)]
*  If you're paying for this war, which the United States is, the US Congress is, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2696.64s)]
*  Mike Johnson is, don't you have a moral obligation to know its consequences? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2701.3599999999997s)]
*  Like, how can you get up there with a Ukrainian lapel pin and talk about the brave Ukrainian [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2706.4s)]
*  people who are being killed by the hundreds of thousands, and you don't even keep track [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2712.48s)]
*  of the casualties? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2715.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, aren't you kind of a monster for doing that? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2716.8s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2718.48s)]
*  And you look at, if you made the pictures of the modern battle space on the front a little grainy [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2719.28s)]
*  in black and white, it's indistinguishable from the Battle of the Somme or World War I. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2725.84s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2730.8s)]
*  A grinding, crushing, pointless loss of humanity. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2733.1200000000003s)]
*  But it's being abetted by our policymakers. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2737.92s)]
*  They're responsible for this to some extent. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2741.44s)]
*  Like, what? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2743.28s)]
*  And it's shocking how uniparty government has become. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2744.0800000000004s)]
*  You don't seem shocked that they don't care about how many Ukrainians have died. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2749.52s)]
*  They don't care about how many US troops die, really. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2753.76s)]
*  Good point. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2756.56s)]
*  No, it's totally fair point. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2757.1200000000003s)]
*  Because they'll send US troops to war with a whole bunch of cockamamie rules of engagement [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2758.64s)]
*  and policies, and it's just not a serious way to wage warfare. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2765.6s)]
*  The whole premise of GWOT was that by surging by American magic and precision, we could always [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2770.64s)]
*  just clip off the head of the snake and the whole body would die of the snake. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2777.2s)]
*  And that's just that flies in the face of every kind of warfare. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2781.2s)]
*  When you look back to World War II, we killed off 30% of the German male population. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2785.6000000000004s)]
*  World War I, same. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2792.7200000000003s)]
*  American Civil War, same. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2794.1600000000003s)]
*  The Continental Wars in Europe in the 1700s, 1800s, back to the Punic and Pelvanesian Wars. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2797.6000000000004s)]
*  You destroy their manpower, the logistics, and their finance. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2803.6000000000004s)]
*  This, cutting off the head of the snake, is a fool's errand. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2806.8s)]
*  Is there any precedent for it in history? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2811.28s)]
*  No. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2813.1200000000003s)]
*  So I thought a key component of education at the military academies was military history. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2814.0s)]
*  No, I'm serious. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2820.7200000000003s)]
*  You're a living example of it. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2822.56s)]
*  You went to one and you know an awful lot about your business. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2824.2400000000002s)]
*  I didn't read, I didn't learn that at the academy. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2827.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2830.08s)]
*  No. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2830.56s)]
*  No, that's a lifetime of curiosity. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2831.44s)]
*  I was a military history geek as a kid when we, my family went to Normandy when I was 11. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2834.4s)]
*  And I was the tour guide. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2839.6800000000003s)]
*  Sword gold, Juno Beach, Pegasus Bridge, all that. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2842.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I was that nerdy geeky kid. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2845.2000000000003s)]
*  So do you think your average modern flag officer is just sort of not aware of the history of warfare? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2848.4s)]
*  I'm sure they get some level of it, but they have not made it a career. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2854.88s)]
*  I'd say the best book I read on general officers was one, it was a British military study. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2859.36s)]
*  It's called The Psychology of Military Incompetence. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2866.7200000000003s)]
*  And it went through five of the biggest disasters in British military history, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2869.92s)]
*  like the surrender at Singapore. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2875.2s)]
*  Yeah, Khartoum. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2876.88s)]
*  Yeah, Khartoum, Baghdad in World War I. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2878.0s)]
*  Of course, the Afghan withdrawal. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2881.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2883.12s)]
*  Into Peshawar. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2884.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2885.52s)]
*  And it literally looked through the guy's childhood, where he went to school, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2886.4s)]
*  his relationship with his father, all the rest, and very consistent themes. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2892.7200000000003s)]
*  What were they? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2897.92s)]
*  They were very bookish, very geeky, no introspection. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2899.68s)]
*  Yeah. So they're Tony Blinken, basically. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2910.7200000000003s)]
*  Just not people able to say, okay, this is not working. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2913.44s)]
*  We're going to tack the boat because this is not working in this direction. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2918.32s)]
*  They're weak men, in other words. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2924.08s)]
*  Yeah, look, the anomaly of Patton doesn't occur very often. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2925.44s)]
*  Patton, who's been maligned since his death, remarkable human being. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2935.92s)]
*  And of course, Hollywood is, I don't know how many movies they've done telling us Patton was bad. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2941.76s)]
*  But there are some suggestions that Patton was also murdered. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2946.96s)]
*  Do you think that that's possible? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2949.04s)]
*  It'd be a hell of a difficult... [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2951.84s)]
*  Well, I don't know if the traffic accident, the Jeep rollover was an accident. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2953.92s)]
*  But he survived it and then died later. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2958.96s)]
*  Man, I don't know. But he hated the Soviets. He hated communism. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2963.04s)]
*  Oh, I know. So I don't want to get too far afield here, but [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2966.2400000000002s)]
*  that does seem like a pivot point in world history, where that... April 1945, Hitler kills himself, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2972.16s)]
*  Berlin is occupied by the Russians, et cetera, et cetera. We win in Europe. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2979.68s)]
*  And then we pivot toward the Soviet Union for a few years, until maybe the Rosenbergs were... [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2984.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, and even the amount of communist agents that were surrounding Roosevelt. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2990.08s)]
*  Oh, well, Harry Hopkins and... [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2994.8s)]
*  Well, Harry Hopkins is literally a Soviet agent. Yeah, right. So why did that happen? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=2996.4s)]
*  Like, how do we fight this war for freedom and then wind up sort of handing Poland to Stalin, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3004.08s)]
*  for example, on the side of the totalitarian? Handing all of those countries of the world. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3010.56s)]
*  Well, of course. Yeah, it showed... [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3014.4s)]
*  So how is this a war for freedom if we're handing half of them? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3017.2s)]
*  An exhaustion of moral leadership. Yeah. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3019.36s)]
*  I think... Who was that? Who do you think, if we could hold one person responsible for that? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3022.3199999999997s)]
*  Truman was president, because Roosevelt was dead. So as Churchill said, he died in the traces. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3026.7999999999997s)]
*  But I think when you look at history, the lie of socialism, communism, it's easy for elitists [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3033.28s)]
*  to love that paradigm, because the right-wing Austrian school economics approach is massive [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3046.4s)]
*  decentralization, decision-making at the micro level. A farmer knows what prices are, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3055.12s)]
*  has a good idea what demand is going to be, decides whether he's going to plant more acres [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3062.56s)]
*  that year or not, and takes that risk himself. The Soviet planner says, I need everyone to plant [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3067.52s)]
*  this many acres, and we're going to do it at this price. And it's the lie of individual incentive [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3074.08s)]
*  versus massive central planning to the betterment of elite thinking with the grift that goes with [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3080.56s)]
*  it. And that's like a mind worm disease that so many people continue generation after generation [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3087.7599999999998s)]
*  continue to fall for. Yeah, it's a mom-based system, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3095.2s)]
*  whereas the let the farmer figure it out, it's a dad-based system. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3098.08s)]
*  Yeah. It's true. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3102.7999999999997s)]
*  What, are you a farmer? How do you know? That's what your dad says. Your mom's like, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3103.84s)]
*  no, let's get it all. Sorry. But that's why I'm so excited to see Milet having success in Argentina [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3107.76s)]
*  for a guy. And maybe it's an analogy to America, because he got sick. At the end of World War II, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3117.0400000000004s)]
*  per capita living standards in Argentina were higher than Switzerland. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3124.8s)]
*  Yes. Peronistas, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3128.0800000000004s)]
*  socialists take over. They run the country basically off the cliff. Hyperinflation, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3130.6400000000003s)]
*  economic refuge, terrible. Milet gets sick of not only the peronistas, but the pathetic, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3137.04s)]
*  so-called right-wing opposition, which is not opposition. He starts his own political party [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3143.36s)]
*  and he wins. I mean, I like any guy that'll campaign with a chainsaw. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3148.56s)]
*  I agree with that. You think that'll happen here? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3152.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think the Republican party is really that salvageable anymore. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3156.96s)]
*  No, of course not. Because it's been [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3160.48s)]
*  gobbled up by corporatists. And the defense industry now spreads money equally, right and left, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3161.68s)]
*  not even really right, just across the Washington insiders. So yeah, maybe at an entirely new [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3173.12s)]
*  political movement. That's why Trump is transformational, because he kind of came [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3179.12s)]
*  outside the Republican party and did it. And I hope he can move the needle somewhere in the [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3182.8799999999997s)]
*  right direction, because it's teetering. So I got to ask you a personal question. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3189.36s)]
*  We were in the Middle East together not that long ago, and I noticed two things. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3192.96s)]
*  One, you flew coach to the Middle East, which obviously you don't need to do, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3196.96s)]
*  but you did it on purpose. I think that is your custom. We're the same age, three weeks apart. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3203.52s)]
*  And I think most like, why would you do that? And the second thing I noticed is you went from there [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3209.76s)]
*  to some far more obscure part of the world. So like, explain those things, if you would. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3214.16s)]
*  When I got on the SEAL teams earlier than I wanted to, I loved being a SEAL. I was pretty good at it, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3227.68s)]
*  I think. And I would have had a nice career going there. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3233.92s)]
*  For those who don't know the story, if you could explain why you got out. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3237.92s)]
*  My dad died when I was 25, and my wife got cancer. No, I was 26, he was 29, and she got cancer. So I [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3241.2s)]
*  got out to sort out the home front. And that's really why I started Blackwater, just as a way [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3250.08s)]
*  to stay connected to the SEAL teams. I knew nothing of business, nothing of land development, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3254.4799999999996s)]
*  nothing of government contracting, but I kind of knew what the special operations community needed. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3259.9199999999996s)]
*  And building that business was a really great experience. It was family policy for [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3265.84s)]
*  my dad to not come and work in the family business after college. You had to go do your own thing. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3273.68s)]
*  I didn't want anything to do with this business. I don't think I was really suited for it. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3278.96s)]
*  But I was going to come and work with him after 12 years or so of being a SEAL. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3284.96s)]
*  Starting Blackwater, building it was one of the most satisfying things I've ever done in my life. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3290.4s)]
*  Bringing together people with great talents that were really good, that they'd gained in the [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3295.68s)]
*  military and they'd retired or gotten out, and having it smashed the way it was, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3301.2s)]
*  really left a bad taste in my mouth. And I'll be honest, I carry a big chip on my shoulder yet. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3307.84s)]
*  And I try to keep it in perspective. So look, I had a business that was crushed and lost. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3312.88s)]
*  Thousands of guys lost their lives, their limbs, their mental health, their spouses [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3318.56s)]
*  over a badly run war in two theaters by idiot Washington elites. Same idiots that smashed my [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3322.4s)]
*  business. So yeah, I got a chip on my shoulder to do something big and effective and spectacular [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3329.6800000000003s)]
*  again and run hard until that happens. Or I die trying. But I mean, 54, 55 year old guys [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3337.52s)]
*  who've been successful, which you have been despite having your business smashed, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3344.32s)]
*  they don't fly coach. What is that? Is that just a Spartan impulse? Or you just don't want to get [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3347.92s)]
*  there? You get there at the same time. Yeah, but it's like, Tucker, I fly so much that anyway, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3352.0s)]
*  look, I know. I'm not an absolute, I'm not a purist. I do fly business class 10% of the time. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3360.48s)]
*  I mean, that's, that's fine if you're flying to Fort Lauderdale from DC or something, but you know, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3372.8s)]
*  Dubai's a long way. I just think it's very, very interesting. Learn to sleep in any position. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3377.2s)]
*  So that's what it is. That's what it is. Yeah. Yeah, I like that. What's the weirdest place [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3381.68s)]
*  you've been recently? Why are you always in Africa? What do you do for a living, Eric? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3386.48s)]
*  I feel like I know you pretty well. I'm not really sure. I would say there are lots of countries [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3399.68s)]
*  that need help organizing with the basics of tax collection and security assistance and border [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3406.0s)]
*  security and police advisement because what we take for granted in America, if you want to start [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3416.08s)]
*  a business in America, you can call a law office in Delaware, get a business in two hours for 200 [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3424.4s)]
*  bucks. It's simple. And you can get title to your land here and you can get a bank account. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3431.28s)]
*  You get a business license. You can, you can do all those things that make capital formation [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3436.48s)]
*  possible. There are so many parts of the world where that's not possible. And so providing them [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3441.1200000000003s)]
*  the very basic means of a reliable police department or the means to stop gangs, jihadi [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3446.1600000000003s)]
*  gangs, criminal gangs, whatever. So I do provide some advice to countries how to do that from time [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3455.84s)]
*  to time. Judging by what little I know of your travel schedule, it seems pretty frequent. That's [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3461.12s)]
*  interesting. So since you are everywhere all the time and most Americans are, including me, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3468.48s)]
*  sort of only dimly aware of what's happening around the world, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3475.6s)]
*  name three places we should be paying more attention to now than we are. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3478.72s)]
*  The Chinese Communist Party has been very active in Mexico. The fentanyl crisis is very much, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3482.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, last year fentanyl in America killed like 109,000 people. Yes. It is funded, organized, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3489.6800000000003s)]
*  logistically facilitated by the Chinese Communist Party to move the precursor chemicals that are [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3499.92s)]
*  actually made near Wuhan, China, shipped to either Venezuela or Mexico, fabricated into fentanyl, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3505.2s)]
*  and basically blended with other common drugs that people are taking. And it doesn't make any [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3511.2s)]
*  sense to do so because why would a drug dealer want to kill his customers? That's what's happening. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3516.72s)]
*  And it is an absolute, it's a fuck you from the CCP against the West for the opium wars of the 1840s. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3522.72s)]
*  And it's done to- To murder American children. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3531.92s)]
*  100%. Yes. And just to be clear, these are not junkies who like took too much. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3534.7999999999997s)]
*  No. These are kids who ordered a Valium off Instagram. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3540.64s)]
*  Yes, or a bootleg Percocet or something. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3544.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And so there are people dying. And that is, you trace that, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3548.64s)]
*  and I can show all of that going right back to mainland China. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3554.3999999999996s)]
*  Why are we sending all these armaments to Ukraine and we could bomb those facilities in Mexico? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3563.2799999999997s)]
*  Excuse me, 100,000 Americans a year. You don't need to bomb. Fire is an [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3570.16s)]
*  underutilized tool. That's true. Well, it's happening here. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3574.24s)]
*  I noticed there are quite a few manufacturing and agricultural facilities that seem to be [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3579.68s)]
*  going up in smoke in this country. Yeah. And so look, and on that, the last time [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3583.2s)]
*  Blinken was in Beijing, he didn't even call them on it to say, stop. He said, well, no, it's, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3590.16s)]
*  yeah, maybe some of the stuff is coming from China, but it's really just a shipping, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3595.68s)]
*  accidental shipping problem. I mean, it is such a denial of reality. It's hard to stomach. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3599.2799999999997s)]
*  So what you're saying is you're not speculating about this. This is known. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3608.3199999999997s)]
*  100%. Do the intelligence, I assume, know this? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3611.28s)]
*  Yeah, but nobody wants to do anything. Why? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3615.84s)]
*  I think the, you have an agency that doesn't want to do their job. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3620.88s)]
*  Which agency? CIA. Because I think, and I know you have, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3626.0800000000004s)]
*  rightly, very mixed feelings on the CIA. However, the mission of the CIA, if you think about [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3630.6400000000003s)]
*  the State Department can handle 5% of issues, diplomats and embassies. You want your military [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3638.8s)]
*  over here, your conventional military. It's a big angry dog waiting to be let off leash. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3644.8s)]
*  That hopefully never is. The middle of the world, those problems, you think about how [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3649.76s)]
*  the Soviet Union was really undermined in the 80s. There was 20 covert action findings that [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3657.52s)]
*  were signed, coupled by Carter, mostly by Reagan, done to undermine the Soviet Union, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3663.68s)]
*  economically, politically, culturally, socially. That was done under Title 50 authorities and that [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3668.3999999999996s)]
*  worked. Without having to involve big military expenditure, there are, if you want to stop, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3674.24s)]
*  we know fentanyl is a problem. We know the Chinese are a problem doing it. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3682.8799999999997s)]
*  That's specifically what the Title 50 authorities are for, to say to six guys, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3687.3599999999997s)]
*  go make that problem stop. If you have an agency that doesn't want to do their job, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3692.48s)]
*  that's why it's not happening. They seem to be doing so many other things. I have fun with CIA. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3699.28s)]
*  My dad worked with CIA. I was never against CIA. I thought only dumb liberals were against CIA [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3703.52s)]
*  and traitors or whatever. My views on CIA have evolved based on things that I have seen and [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3709.44s)]
*  personally experienced. My conclusion is not that everyone there, particularly the paramilitaries, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3714.64s)]
*  I know a million of them seem like great guys, whatever, but on some basic level, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3722.24s)]
*  it seems totally out of control to me. It is. When you have the leadership of the CIA, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3726.16s)]
*  this Havana syndrome is a real thing. What does that mean? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3734.16s)]
*  It's effectively a microwave weapon that's been used to effectively blast the brains of Americans [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3737.92s)]
*  working out of embassies, first in Havana, Colombia, Delhi, Hanoi, Vienna, Washington, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3747.04s)]
*  D.C., lots of places, okay? Hurting, severely hurting Americans serving abroad. The CIA director [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3756.0s)]
*  says it's all in their minds. It's bulimia. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3765.68s)]
*  That's wrong. When your people are getting screwed by a- [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3771.6s)]
*  So you think that's, I don't have a view on that. I don't know the answer, but I'm sympathetic to, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3774.56s)]
*  open to both possibilities being true, but you think based on evidence that this is absolutely [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3780.7999999999997s)]
*  real. Yes. I know it to be real. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3785.04s)]
*  Wow. Who's doing this and why? It was a device that was developed in the Soviet Union [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3788.56s)]
*  in the early 70s, actually in Ukraine. I think the Kharkiv development plant. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3796.88s)]
*  It had nothing to do with the Ukrainians now, but it's about the size of a [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3804.96s)]
*  like a beverage cart on an aircraft, that size device. It's very damaging and the fact that the [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3811.12s)]
*  Russians can do that to us without consequences, it shows how pathetic they view the CIA and the [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3818.64s)]
*  U.S. government to not push back on consequences. So CIA, what motive would they have to pretend [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3826.24s)]
*  this wasn't real? Because it would require pushback somewhere, somehow. But they're literally [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3832.16s)]
*  fighting Russia in Ukraine. CIA is all over Ukraine fighting Russia. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3837.92s)]
*  Good question. I mean, put it this way, they don't like me enough that I was uninvited from [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3842.32s)]
*  a dear friend's retirement 10 days ago. Oh, I bet they don't like you and you've [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3848.08s)]
*  obviously worked with them most of your life, right? We did a lot of great work for them, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3851.92s)]
*  100% success rate, but yeah, look, the wrong people being in charge, the agency has also [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3857.04s)]
*  gotten hyper bloated. Basically the same number of case officers that there's always been for 25 [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3865.44s)]
*  years, but the place has grown tenfold of all the wrong kind of people under the decision making [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3870.48s)]
*  of a guy like Brennan. And why does Brennan hate the actual DO, the director of operations? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3877.2000000000003s)]
*  Because he's a failed case officer. He flunked out of school. I mean, how did a guy that voted [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3882.48s)]
*  for Gus Hall in 1976, who was Gus Hall? Gustavo Hallberg. He was the Finnish-American [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3887.76s)]
*  head of the American Communist Party in New York City. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3894.4s)]
*  Exactly. How does a guy vote for the head of the Communist Party in 1976 at the height of the [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3896.64s)]
*  Cold War and then pass whatever background check the agency is doing and have a security clearance? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3901.6800000000003s)]
*  I find that stunning. He retains his security clearance [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3907.76s)]
*  because the last administration refused to strip him of his security clearance despite the fact [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3910.96s)]
*  he was actively working to undermine a democratically elected president. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3914.64s)]
*  Yeah. No, I know the levels of betrayal [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3917.76s)]
*  and self-betrayal are just almost mind-boggling. Let me ask you specifically about what the CIA [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3920.48s)]
*  does in Ukraine. So I think it's fair to say based on what even the New York Times has reported that [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3925.04s)]
*  the CIA is running effectively the Ukrainian intel services. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3931.84s)]
*  I don't know. I honestly don't know that. I'm sure they have been there advising and supporting, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3937.68s)]
*  but I think the Ukrainians probably grew frustrated at [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3943.2799999999997s)]
*  lack of willingness to do certain things. So I don't know where the US support ends and [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3951.9199999999996s)]
*  where the Ukrainian unilateral stuff begins. I ask because they've assassinated people. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3957.6s)]
*  I think they tried to assassinate me, for example, but they definitely killed Alexander [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3962.3199999999997s)]
*  Dudin's daughter. They allowed an American critic of the Ukrainian government to die in prison, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3966.24s)]
*  Consolidate Lyra. And you're sort of like, well, wait a second. If this is a proxy war [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3976.9599999999996s)]
*  and we're overseeing it, then is the US government aware of this, responsible for it? Like what? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3982.24s)]
*  US government should protect American citizens, but clearly it's not. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3989.52s)]
*  And if you had a honest, look, Devin Nunes did a good job as the chairman of the HIPC [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=3993.76s)]
*  of trying to dig into the nonsense. And he obviously met all kinds of resistance, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4001.0400000000004s)]
*  but he had fight in them. Now the Republican oversight of the intel committee or of the intel [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4005.92s)]
*  agencies, completely inadequate. But even then, and I liked Devin a lot, but those guys are all [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4011.6800000000003s)]
*  afraid of the CIA, as you know, they're afraid of them. They know they're being spied on by CIA [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4017.36s)]
*  or NSA or any FBI. They know they're being spied on, they're supposed to be in charge of [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4022.16s)]
*  overseeing these agencies or being spied on by them. They're fully aware of that. I know, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4028.16s)]
*  because they've told me to my face, I'm not guessing. And that's just, that's not democracy. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4034.08s)]
*  That's like totally crazy. Yeah. That's like Marcus Wolf and the Stasi. That's exactly what he did. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4038.96s)]
*  That's exactly right. The East German referendum. Because the Stasi was way more effective than any [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4044.72s)]
*  other Intel service, even the KGB. Yes. It was the embodiment of German efficiency, innovation. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4050.88s)]
*  And it was like the only effective institution in the entire country. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4057.12s)]
*  What does that mean? Everything was in order. Yeah. Nice. So, and then I know that CIA runs [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4061.36s)]
*  businesses, like runs businesses outside the country and those resources of income for the [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4069.36s)]
*  agency. How can a government agency run businesses? I don't understand that. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4075.84s)]
*  I am truly not aware of any of that. Okay. How do you rein it in? I mean, because it, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4082.0s)]
*  of course, could be an essential tool of diplomacy, statecraft, of the projection of power. I mean, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4088.5600000000004s)]
*  you could see how CIA could be helpful to your country. The agency is the most easy to reform [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4094.4s)]
*  of all federal agencies. Civil service rules don't apply. Yes. You can fire anyone for any reason [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4098.8s)]
*  that fast. You could clean house, have a all hands meeting at the bubble on a Friday, and send 50% [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4105.12s)]
*  of them home. Send them out to their cars and tell them, we'll ship your stuff from your desk. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4112.0s)]
*  You could clean it out that fast. But why does no one do that? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4118.32s)]
*  Maybe no one's had the balls to, as the director or the deputy director, to do that. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4124.08s)]
*  Do you believe CIA has in the last 25 years used violence against any American citizen? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4128.0s)]
*  Yeah. Barack Obama killed an American citizen and his 16 year old son, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4134.48s)]
*  Al Awake in Yemen. Right. And that's publicly known, but there are all sorts of, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4140.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, there's evidence that that's not an isolated. Maybe there's more, but I know that one. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4148.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So you don't think it's crazy to assume that? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4154.0s)]
*  Entirely possible. Well, there's a lot of people that are considered American citizens that [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4157.12s)]
*  probably shouldn't be considered American citizens. I agree with that. But in actual America. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4162.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Fair. But the left has so devalued citizenship, it should mean something to be an [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4166.719999999999s)]
*  American. I mean, a Roman citizen, it meant something. A Venezuelan gang member who's here [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4174.0s)]
*  illegally is every bit as American as you who were born in Western Michigan. So yes, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4181.44s)]
*  I'm quite aware of that. Anchor babies, birthrights, citizenship, all of that must go. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4188.4s)]
*  Yeah. You wonder, you know, if we've reached a point where that it's impossible for the country [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4196.64s)]
*  to act in its own interest just because of the changes due to immigration. I read a lot of [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4202.64s)]
*  history and I know that things have been a lot worse in certain societies. And corrective events [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4208.08s)]
*  can be shocking and traumatic to people, but it's still possible. CIA and not just CIA, but FBI [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4214.5599999999995s)]
*  and other agencies supposed to be enforcing the law and gathering intelligence have, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4223.68s)]
*  this has been shown, withheld information from democratically elected presidents. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4229.28s)]
*  A number of them, certainly Trump. That's a crime, is it not? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4234.16s)]
*  Yeah. And it should be met with immediate discipline. And that's a matter of having [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4238.4s)]
*  people that will follow through and wade through the bureaucratic process and exercise the [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4244.8s)]
*  authority that they're charged with doing. Right? When you join the military, you swear to defend [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4250.48s)]
*  the constitution against all enemies foreign domestic, we should probably do something similar [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4255.36s)]
*  for any civilian employee of the federal government that they swear to defend the [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4261.12s)]
*  constitution, not swear allegiance to a political leader. Of course not. Constitution. Right. But [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4264.0s)]
*  it's not a constitutional republic if, you know, unelected employees of the federal government [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4269.76s)]
*  ignore the elected employees. Yeah. Well, that's something love it or hate it at Blackwater. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4275.599999999999s)]
*  Every contractor that worked for us swore to defend the constitution, the same oath they swore when [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4281.92s)]
*  they joined the military or law enforcement. They've swore it again in our presence. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4287.28s)]
*  As a reminder that we're here to serve. So I want to ask you about spying on American citizens so [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4292.08s)]
*  we know that it's widespread, it's accelerating, data is being collected about every single one [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4300.4s)]
*  of us and the vector for a lot of that is the phone. So it's like super useful, of course, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4305.5199999999995s)]
*  but it's also the main vulnerability if you care about privacy and freedom. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4312.639999999999s)]
*  So you've created a phone that allows people to, to some extent, to opt out of the current spying [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4316.88s)]
*  regime. Let me back up to where, I guess, where this started. You know, if you think about after [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4322.96s)]
*  9-11, suddenly, holy shit, all these federal agencies are waking up and how do we prevent [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4330.8s)]
*  this kind of conspiracy and attack against us again? And so they start looking at [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4336.5599999999995s)]
*  data. But of course, in 9-11, we didn't have smartphones. But as smartphones become available [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4341.44s)]
*  and the technology that goes around a smartphone, because what is a smartphone? It's basically a [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4348.799999999999s)]
*  highly capable personal computer in your hand that's constantly linked to a network. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4355.44s)]
*  And so as ad data into the private sector always innovates much faster than governments do. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4361.2s)]
*  And so as Apple and Google mobile services [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4367.52s)]
*  start developing phones, they put ad IDs and tracking information on those phones. Why? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4372.4800000000005s)]
*  To micro target you to sell advertising. They gather and collect micro information about you [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4379.52s)]
*  so that they can sell precision information to advertisers who want to sell you stuff. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4387.76s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of what that information is? What do they know about you? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4392.8s)]
*  Well, an advertising ID is like a 25-digit alphanumeric code that sits on your phone. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4397.4400000000005s)]
*  And it enables to collect where you go, what you buy, who you call, and what you browse. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4405.200000000001s)]
*  It even works with the apps sitting on your phone, which are also built with a [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4412.08s)]
*  software developer kit that comes from Google. And they pay you more to put the Google hooks in [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4417.76s)]
*  so that those apps can also turn on the microphone on your phone or the camera or the GPS. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4424.96s)]
*  So that your phone, yes, it's a computer, but effectively becomes a mobile microphone [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4433.12s)]
*  collection listening device that fits in your pocket or sits in your nightstand. And it collects [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4439.68s)]
*  anything and everything about what you do. And so it's almost been like a slow boiling of a frog [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4446.88s)]
*  because as smartphones become common, it becomes very convenient and it's wonderful. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4454.16s)]
*  And it becomes more and more pervasive in our lives, providing us music and news [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4461.68s)]
*  and communications and pictures and videos of our family. Every bit of that data is collected, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4468.0s)]
*  analyzed, parsed, and resold to advertisers. The five leading big tech companies have a combined [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4475.44s)]
*  market cap that's like the third or fourth largest nation in the world off of that surveillance [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4483.919999999999s)]
*  capitalism model. So as smartphones have become available, it's slow boiled all of us into a point [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4490.24s)]
*  of holy shit. And I guess for me, the oh shit moment was after the 2020 election and seeing [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4499.2s)]
*  the power that big tech had to sway that election and to control who could speak on certain platforms [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4506.4s)]
*  and zeroing out certain people. And I actually had a tech team together at the time doing a [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4520.08s)]
*  forensics thing. And in a rage phone call, I said, fuck it, we're going to build a phone. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4526.72s)]
*  And we pivoted and that team then started working and yeah, we built a phone as an answer because [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4533.76s)]
*  we're never going to make big tech change by whining about it. They're way too much money [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4544.56s)]
*  and way too much power. We have to provide a means for people to communicate freely, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4549.6s)]
*  securely, and most importantly, that they can control their data. I think it's inherently [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4557.280000000001s)]
*  American that we accept. We expect privacy as Americans. Think about the constitution. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4562.96s)]
*  First amendment is free speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly. Second, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4570.96s)]
*  we know what that guarantees. The first, what's the third amendment? What was most important for [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4575.76s)]
*  the founding fathers? Privacy. Get these damn British troops out of my house. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4581.6s)]
*  Of course. No quartering act because there was actually British soldiers being put into [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4587.04s)]
*  people's houses. Privacy. Fourth amendment, the right to privacy in the searches of our personal [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4592.0s)]
*  data. What big tech has created in surveillance capitalism is more pervasive and more intrusive [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4601.92s)]
*  than anything you could ever possibly. It's more pervasive than Marcus Wolf of the Stasi [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4610.64s)]
*  or Beria of the KGB, of the NKVD could ever possibly imagine. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4617.6s)]
*  Anything that happens in contemporary North Korea. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4622.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes, exactly. And we give it away. We give it away freely. And so people still close the [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4624.96s)]
*  bathroom stall when you go into the toilet. You still close the shower curtain. We still do lots [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4631.44s)]
*  of things that we expect to have a privacy, but yet people with a regular phone put it on their [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4637.759999999999s)]
*  nightstand and are surprised that the microphone is listening. I've had so many people I've talked to [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4645.04s)]
*  about. They said, I was talking to my wife about needing a new mattress in our bedroom. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4650.96s)]
*  The next day they're getting advertising for mattresses, which means the camera or the phone [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4658.400000000001s)]
*  was listening to them in their bedroom with all the follow-on conclusions to be drawn from that. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4663.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, given what happens in healthy bedrooms, what happens to those recordings? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4670.16s)]
*  Well, we've been doing a study following our device, a Google Mobile Services phone, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4677.76s)]
*  any Android running Google Mobile Services, which is all of them, or an iPhone. And about 3am, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4684.48s)]
*  we're seeing a spike of data leaving the phone, about 50 megabytes. That is basically that phone [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4691.839999999999s)]
*  dialing home to the mothership, exporting all of your goings on. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4698.879999999999s)]
*  All your pillow talk is going to. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4703.12s)]
*  Pillow talk, whatever. Right. So Zuckerberg paid $20 billion for WhatsApp. Why? Because every [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4704.719999999999s)]
*  message, call, video, picture, voice note, everything that goes through there, they say, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4713.76s)]
*  well, it's end-to-end encrypted. Yeah, it's end-to-end until it passes through their server, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4720.08s)]
*  where it's sliced and diced and analyzed and used to push, used to sell advertising [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4725.92s)]
*  to that customer. If you're not paying for something, you're not the customer, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4732.4800000000005s)]
*  you are the product. So if you want to get, well, I think people right now are [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4736.320000000001s)]
*  used to Mark Zuckerberg listening from their nightstand every night, because that's effectively [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4743.68s)]
*  what your phone does. So why isn't he the creepiest person in world history if he's listening to [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4748.4800000000005s)]
*  what's going on in your bedroom? Because they're able, as Big Tech, to shape that message. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4754.320000000001s)]
*  That's the frightening thing about the power of Big Tech and their ability to influence [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4759.92s)]
*  what you watch, what you think about candidates. If you search something, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4765.76s)]
*  how they score those rankings, it is shocking. We have an antitrust problem here in America, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4770.64s)]
*  vastly worse than in the late 1800s, early 1900s with oil and railways and steel and all the rest. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4778.64s)]
*  This is more important. Yeah, this is literally how we communicate and interact with other human [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4786.96s)]
*  beings in our lives, how we gather and share information about the realities of life, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4792.88s)]
*  of food, of medicine, of vaccines, of healthcare issues, of truth. Especially in an era of AI, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4800.64s)]
*  it's scary stuff. The average kid in America by the time they reach the age of [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4811.52s)]
*  13 has had 72 million data points collected on them by Big Tech. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4816.08s)]
*  It's almost like that much collection allows digital grooming by Big Tech to shape your [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4825.28s)]
*  preferences, how you interact, et cetera. Including your sexual preferences. If we're being [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4834.32s)]
*  honest here. Yeah, exactly. Considering that young people are introduced to sexuality through [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4839.2s)]
*  pornography. Given that there's no privacy, it's probably pretty dumb to watch porn. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4843.44s)]
*  Yeah, nothing's private. Right. What happens to all this data? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4852.08s)]
*  Well, now, obviously it's used and stored. The bloom of data centers surrounding all these tech [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4859.919999999999s)]
*  hubs around America is horrific. All that data is being collected and stored. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4871.12s)]
*  Can I just ask you just a far field question, if I'm just interested? Given that those data centers [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4878.96s)]
*  are some of the biggest users of electricity, they're like a steel plant. Massive electricity [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4883.28s)]
*  draw. Using electricity is, of course, destroying the planet and accelerating climate change. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4889.2s)]
*  Why are the climate change zombies defacing paintings in museums and not protesting data [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4894.72s)]
*  centers? I would say if they were coming after data centers, then they would be getting a nonstop [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4901.92s)]
*  stream of social media messaging of why they should be attacking art instead of data centers. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4911.92s)]
*  Well, exactly. Why are the AI ghouls, why is Mark Zuckerberg, why are they not climate criminals? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4917.6s)]
*  Why am I a climate criminal for having a wood stove and a Silverado, but the people who run [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4923.76s)]
*  data centers, which literally draw more power than fucking steel? With 100% backup as well. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4929.92s)]
*  Right. I'm not against using energy. I'm pro energy actually and cheap energy, but [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4935.68s)]
*  by the current rules, they're criminals. Why does no one call them criminals? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4940.72s)]
*  Because big tech has shockingly complete control over how that messaging is. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4947.36s)]
*  Yes, over our minds and what we think. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4954.4s)]
*  Sorry, but you brought it right back to the point, which is- [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4958.639999999999s)]
*  And so now Congress, including a lot of Republicans in their idiocy, have not only extended FISA, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4962.24s)]
*  FISA started as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4973.28s)]
*  Yeah, 1977-ish. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4975.68s)]
*  Yeah. Supposed to be measuring, monitoring how you collect intelligence, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4977.68s)]
*  communications going to foreigners. Now FISA is really all about Americans. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4985.44s)]
*  I guess we're treated as foreigners by our own government. And so the federal agencies got sick [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4991.28s)]
*  of getting beat up when they had come before Congress for millions of times illegally [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=4998.0s)]
*  accessing what was supposed to be FISA unauthorized communications information. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5006.48s)]
*  And for buying all this commercial data that's collected and held and disseminated by big tech [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5013.36s)]
*  to facilitate advertising and typing and measuring where you go, what you buy, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5022.16s)]
*  who you call, what you browse, everything about you in a way that any previous intelligence boss [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5028.72s)]
*  would have salivated over. So now the new FISA, it's not an extension, it's a massive enlargement, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5035.44s)]
*  says that any federal agent for any reason without probable cause or a warrant can compel [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5044.32s)]
*  any company that holds any of that personal data to turn it over, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5051.12s)]
*  allowing a massive fishing expedition on anybody that's considered an opponent of that [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5058.4s)]
*  off-the-reservation federal agent. It's really disgusting. Really, if it's not a stamp act [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5065.76s)]
*  Tea Party 1775 moment, I don't know what is, but it is ultimately your government having [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5075.4400000000005s)]
*  carte blanche to do a digital proctology exam on you with no questions asked. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5082.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, considering that these companies hold audio of you having sex with your wife, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5088.88s)]
*  video of you watching pornography, audio of you telling racial jokes or whatever, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5094.88s)]
*  your most intimate moments, the ones that could be used to blackmail and destroy you, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5102.8s)]
*  doing things you would not do in public and shouldn't do in public, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5108.88s)]
*  that's just the ultimate power, isn't it? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5113.12s)]
*  Yeah, I guess you either have to not give a shit and fight anyway or- [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5117.04s)]
*  Try to live virtuously too, it helps. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5124.48s)]
*  That always helps. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5126.4s)]
*  Yep. So how does your phone protect people against that? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5127.76s)]
*  Again, like I said, this era started three and a half years ago and we came at it from a completely [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5132.8s)]
*  contrarian view. This phone, it's our hardware made in Indonesia at a Singaporean facility, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5139.44s)]
*  our operating system, all our code, and we are solely focused on data sovereignty. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5149.12s)]
*  That you control. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5157.12s)]
*  It's pretty cool just that I am kind of impressed that you made hardware, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5158.24s)]
*  you didn't just build an app like you actually- [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5164.0s)]
*  Correct, because you have to control it down to the root level of the hardware and the software [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5165.599999999999s)]
*  so that we don't have an advertising ID and our operating system blocks any attempt by any app [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5172.32s)]
*  to turn on your camera or your Wi-Fi or your microphone or your GPS or anything. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5180.96s)]
*  We don't allow any of that leakage. In fact, we have a privacy center. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5186.08s)]
*  This is called the unplugged. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5191.28s)]
*  This is an unplugged phone. And this is effectively a firewall which prevents apps [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5192.4s)]
*  from doing all the things they're used to doing on all the other phones. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5199.04s)]
*  So you're in control of what of your data goes out, which is effectively zero. This is like a safe. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5203.2s)]
*  Comes in, doesn't come out. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5213.68s)]
*  So just to bottom line it, I'm protected from what am I protected from if I use that? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5216.240000000001s)]
*  Here's the thing. If you're using apps and some federal agency goes to that app, purveyor, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5222.64s)]
*  and says, give me everything you have on Tucker that he's been using on that app, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5230.72s)]
*  there'll be nothing because there's no data leaking from you, from your device to that app. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5234.64s)]
*  If you call somebody, we have our own secure messenger. For example, you want to call and [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5241.599999999999s)]
*  make a secure call and you call me, it takes about five seconds to connect because it's [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5246.4s)]
*  literally creating a encrypted tunnel between you and me. Generates a new encryption key every call. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5252.5599999999995s)]
*  It's completely different. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5259.92s)]
*  So the government hates that and there have been all kinds of legal battles over this question. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5261.36s)]
*  They don't want secure communication between citizens because all of a sudden they care about [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5265.679999999999s)]
*  human trafficking or something. Yes. And their latest excuse for this massive FIASA enlargement [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5270.0s)]
*  was drug trafficking. Drug trafficking, right. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5277.52s)]
*  Because they've been failing for 40 freaking years at that. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5280.08s)]
*  Well, they just opened the southern border to fentanyl and human trafficking. So these [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5282.8s)]
*  exact same people are suddenly really worried about human trafficking and drugs. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5286.24s)]
*  Yeah. It's a joke. So we produced 500 units, fielded them last fall. We did a [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5289.2s)]
*  big beta test and now we have 10,000 units. So people can order and deliver. And look, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5299.84s)]
*  it is our effort to fight the power of Big Tech. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5306.48s)]
*  What can't I do? I mean, I'll just confess that I use an iPhone made by a company I actually kind [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5309.84s)]
*  of hate and that hates my country and me and I use it anyway because it's so crazy. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5315.28s)]
*  And we figured there's a lot of people like you that would want to digitally opt out of the lie [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5320.08s)]
*  of Big Tech. And so what you can't do, obviously we don't have the Apple store. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5325.44s)]
*  We don't have Apple Music, but you can use Spotify. You can use a lot of the other streaming [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5329.759999999999s)]
*  services on here. We just prevent them from collecting your data as to what you're listening [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5335.12s)]
*  to or where you are when you do it. What about pictures? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5339.36s)]
*  Of course you can take pictures. And you can share pictures. You can send pictures. We have a lot of [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5342.96s)]
*  the other privacy related apps, whether it's Signal or Threema or Proton or Telegram. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5348.88s)]
*  We have a lot of these. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5355.68s)]
*  Why is nobody done this? So everyone complains about this. Everyone who pays any attention [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5356.8s)]
*  or all understands. Plus the iPhone is incredibly expensive. But they have a hammer lock on your [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5360.4800000000005s)]
*  life. And so this seems like a pretty obvious- Other people have tried it before and they [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5365.92s)]
*  burn through a lot of money and I don't think the timing is right. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5374.0s)]
*  They're not flying coach to Dubai, are they? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5376.88s)]
*  We did this- Man, you are Dutch. I love that. It's like coach to Dubai. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5379.84s)]
*  For example, this phone also has a kill switch, an actual [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5388.56s)]
*  switch which separates the battery from the electronics. You can't shut your iPhone off. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5393.04s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5396.4800000000005s)]
*  It's always listening. It's always pinging towers. It's always pinging Wi-Fi, building a digital [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5397.6s)]
*  breadcrumb trail of where you go and what you do. Even if I turn the iPhone off, it's not off. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5402.08s)]
*  Correct. This, you turn that off, it's off because it physically separates [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5407.36s)]
*  battery from electronics. It's just like pulling the battery out of an old Nokia phone. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5412.32s)]
*  I'm sorry I interrupted you. I love this, of course. It's incredibly ambitious. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5417.04s)]
*  But also on some level, it's kind of obvious. Why haven't we had this before? So you said [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5422.24s)]
*  people have tried, they spent too much money and then I interrupted you. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5425.839999999999s)]
*  And they tried maybe just with an app and just with an app doesn't work. And [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5428.799999999999s)]
*  people have tried to do it with a reskinned Google phone. This phone is incapable of running Google [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5432.959999999999s)]
*  mobile services. So you're not going to get Google Maps. We have a way to navigate that works well. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5439.12s)]
*  But again, so many of the freemium approaches where they've been boiling the frog of the people [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5443.919999999999s)]
*  of the world, we provide them a digital alternative to that where you are in control of your First [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5451.28s)]
*  Amendment rights and your Fourth Amendment rights. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5458.0s)]
*  How, amen. How hard is it to text people who don't have that phone? [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5460.24s)]
*  It's just, look, it emits electrons. So ultimately you can see if it's on a tower or not. But we even [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5466.4s)]
*  provide it with a SIM provider, a data provider, a network airtime provider that collects the [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5472.32s)]
*  minimum amount. Basically all they need is your zip code of where you're buying it. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5482.64s)]
*  That's it. What I'm saying is if I am using an unplugged phone and my wife has an iPhone, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5485.76s)]
*  I can text her. Yes. Sure. And she can even put unplugged messenger on her iPhone as well. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5489.44s)]
*  How much more expensive is that than an iPhone? This is $989. So it's cheaper, about $500 cheaper. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5497.679999999999s)]
*  And it's comparable in speed, storage, camera quality. Can you actually get one? [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5503.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you can order it at unplugged.com slash Tucker. And we will, look, we're big believers [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5509.679999999999s)]
*  or big believer in your audience. I'm a long ardent fan and we think your fans are our people. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5518.0s)]
*  And so we are happy to compensate them and you guys. And we want to win in this together [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5525.2s)]
*  and give people a digital alternative to big tech owning their lives. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5532.48s)]
*  Man, so if, I mean, it's not a threat to Apple right now, but if there's big take up, it could be. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5536.88s)]
*  So what, how do you expect them to try and stifle competition? It's a monopoly. Sure. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5544.72s)]
*  They want to retain monopoly status. Look, if you search for, if you do a Google search for [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5549.68s)]
*  unplugged phone or things like that, they tend to stack every negative article possible written [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5555.360000000001s)]
*  about it first. Oh, there have been bad pieces written. Of course. Of course, the left will [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5560.240000000001s)]
*  always come after me and hate on me for anything. Is it a racist phone? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5565.84s)]
*  The left used to be about free speech and now they're really about kind of state control. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5570.4s)]
*  But does the phone deny the election in 2020? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5576.5599999999995s)]
*  I would argue that the phone cares about your first and fourth amendment rights. And since [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5581.84s)]
*  the erosion of that privacy, I just want to encourage everyone to use cash yet as well. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5590.24s)]
*  Don't go to these, anyone that goes to these woke coffee shops and they say, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5595.52s)]
*  we don't accept cash anymore. Look on the front of a dollar bill. It says, this note is legal [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5602.56s)]
*  tender for all debts, public and private. No one has the ability to deny you using cash. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5608.24s)]
*  So leave them the right change on the table and tell them to have a nice day. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5614.32s)]
*  They cannot make you pay with a credit card. That is actually insurrectionist. If these businesses [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5618.32s)]
*  are denying you the ability to use legal tender of the United States government. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5624.08s)]
*  I had never thought of that. Has anyone tried that? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5628.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. I make an issue of it all the time, much to my kids [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5631.28s)]
*  embarrassment. But yeah, I'm a big advocate. Cash is freedom. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5637.6s)]
*  But the amount of data that is collected on you everywhere. You want to buy gas? Buy gas, [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5641.44s)]
*  pay cash, whatever. But what we see in China where they really don't accept cash anymore [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5648.08s)]
*  and it should become the ultimate surveillance state. That's where we're heading. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5658.0s)]
*  Unless free people unite and resist that kind of totalitarian impulse of big government, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5662.32s)]
*  big tech working together. In China, you have to pay with a WeChat app. So you do your banking [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5668.4s)]
*  through that. You acquire tickets for a bus, an airplane, a train through that. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5675.28s)]
*  You pay road tolls through that. Everything is through this app controlled by the state. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5681.12s)]
*  And so before they even go to a central bank digital currency, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5687.92s)]
*  they literally have you by the balls and they can zero you out instantly. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5692.4s)]
*  Right. Correct. And so we did this because for free people to be able to live in a free society, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5696.639999999999s)]
*  they have to communicate. They have to be able to hold and store data and be able to gather that [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5704.72s)]
*  data without someone else filtering it through an app store that the bad guys control, that the big [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5711.360000000001s)]
*  government guys control. Where do you get cash? From a bank. It sounds like a stupid question, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5717.6s)]
*  but there seem to be fewer ATMs. I don't think that's my imagination. In fact, it's not. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5729.2s)]
*  They don't want you to use cash. There's a de-emphasis on cash. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5735.12s)]
*  Cash equals freedom. I could not agree with you more. And there's something kind of old school [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5738.5599999999995s)]
*  and cool about it anyway. I still remember my dad having $500 bills. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5743.12s)]
*  Yeah. Why don't we have those anymore? War on drugs. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5749.679999999999s)]
*  Really? Yeah. That would be a great thing for the next president of the United States. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5754.0s)]
*  What does that mean? War on drugs? So they just stopped? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5758.4s)]
*  It was a war on cash to cut out illegal activity that was paid for in cash. William McKinley is [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5761.04s)]
*  on the $500 bill. I think they should bring it back and put Donald J. Trump on it. Can you imagine [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5767.76s)]
*  the heads exploding? Yeah, that'd be pretty wild. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5773.28s)]
*  So much of this explosion of government, perpetual wars and perpetual government stupidity comes back [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5778.08s)]
*  to very unsound money. And when we went off the gold standard, when Nixon did, how was it done? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5785.28s)]
*  Was it a vote through Congress? No. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5794.16s)]
*  Was it debated? It was an executive order. Which means you can go back on with executive order as [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5795.679999999999s)]
*  well. Where are you on gold? I'm very pro-gold. It is for millennia been a store of value. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5802.0s)]
*  And I'd say digital blockchain currencies, also interesting. It's hard. Look, anything is of value [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5810.4800000000005s)]
*  if someone recognizes it as a medium of exchange. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5820.96s)]
*  There was a tulip inflation in the Netherlands in like 500 years ago. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5825.280000000001s)]
*  But tulips were currency, tulip bulbs. So lots of things can become- [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5831.280000000001s)]
*  If the prettiest currency ever created. If things get really scary, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5836.56s)]
*  ammunition will be currency. Yes. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5842.32s)]
*  Always has been. Yes, I've had that thought personally. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5844.4s)]
*  Ammunition dogs have a lot of dogs too. So I feel like dogs will be more valuable at some point. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5850.16s)]
*  So are you a gold buyer without getting too specific about it? [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5857.28s)]
*  Some, yeah. But I mean, for heaven sakes, started a company which took on not one, but two multi [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5860.16s)]
*  trillion dollar companies. Because that was a dumb, crazy idea three and a half years ago. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5868.0s)]
*  So I've been investing in this capability for people to communicate securely and freely. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5876.32s)]
*  And I hope it works. And it will never be a public company. We've taken no institutional money. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5882.24s)]
*  It will be a private company, not subject to the SEC and all the other nonsense. It's not even an [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5888.5599999999995s)]
*  American registered company because I didn't want the US government to be able to shut it down. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5895.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. Again, we haven't done- had a conversation really about your personal [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5901.92s)]
*  story, which is one of the most amazing personal stories of anyone I've ever met. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5905.92s)]
*  But among the many twists and turns and ironies of your life is that someone as patriotic as you [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5910.16s)]
*  was basically at one point forced to flee to a foreign country. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5917.36s)]
*  Well, I didn't flee. I went there for a job opportunity, but I'd been attacked unbelievably. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5921.36s)]
*  Oh, I remember. Talking about putting you in jail. I remember that. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5928.24s)]
*  Every federal agency in the world was coming after us. And I paid about two and a half million [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5931.12s)]
*  dollars a month for two years straight in legal fees. I paid the highest per capita fine in state [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5937.36s)]
*  department history. It was the only federal agency that actually stuck us with something [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5944.0s)]
*  because we had no means to contest it because they- at that point, we were working for the [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5948.24s)]
*  State Department doing diplomatic security, protecting Americans, something we did more [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5952.32s)]
*  than a hundred thousand times with no State Department or US official ever killed or injured [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5956.48s)]
*  on our watch. And sometimes the State Department would be demanding, I need 50 more men here. I [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5962.48s)]
*  need 30 more men there. Go immediately. But another part of the State Department, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5968.72s)]
*  the licensing department of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls moving at the speed of [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5973.280000000001s)]
*  peacetime would be slow rolling on the licenses, the export license for like body armor or helmets [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5979.04s)]
*  or guns used by our people working for the State Department. And yeah, I'm not going to send a guy [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5986.8s)]
*  naked to a war zone. So we'd send stuff to do that mission for the State Department in Iraq or [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5993.04s)]
*  Afghanistan or whatever. And so yeah, that was what they had us over the barrel. So they fined me [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=5999.12s)]
*  $42 million for that. Did you pay? Had to. Yeah. Hillary Clinton. Why didn't she like you? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6003.44s)]
*  I don't know. Didn't like your vibe, I guess. What? Not that so much. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6013.6s)]
*  She doesn't fly coach. Once again, where do people watch and get that? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6016.64s)]
*  So I've been very active in the media, but they can go to unplugged.com [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6025.04s)]
*  slash Tucker. You've been very active in the media. In other words, you're out there talking [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6029.360000000001s)]
*  about this. Yeah, I'm for lack of a better spokesman. I'm kind of it for now, but we're [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6034.08s)]
*  looking for more if you'd like to be it. But yeah, no, people can order and they'll get it within [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6038.8s)]
*  36 hours. How hard is it to operate? It's very simple. Look, so it's based on the Android kernel. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6046.16s)]
*  So anybody, any of the apps built for Android, almost 95% of them work on this phone. They look [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6052.8s)]
*  a little different because they're not blasting all the personal ads at you for using the app. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6059.76s)]
*  So again, it's a way for people to be in the world digitally, but not of the world and not have all [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6064.72s)]
*  your stuff collected, stored and disseminated to all kinds of people that hate you. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6070.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, and then it's available, of course, to the US government, which... [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6076.32s)]
*  And another important feature, which I think you'll appreciate on our messenger, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6080.8s)]
*  we even have a dump feature. So if you're using unplugged messenger and someone comes and says, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6084.32s)]
*  Tucker, give me your phone. I'm here to inspect it. You say, sure officer. And you unlock it with [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6089.92s)]
*  a certain code. When you hand it to them, it's a brick. It's a paperweight because it wipes. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6093.44s)]
*  It's an auto dump feature, which wipes the messages or it can even dump the entire phone. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6098.08s)]
*  Dump as in zero it out, hard factory reset, unrecoverable, F you. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6102.64s)]
*  Seriously? Yep. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6108.64s)]
*  So you're traveling through a foreign airport, which is where this, and our airports, this has [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6110.96s)]
*  happened. Yeah. And you can... Yep. Erase the phone. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6114.72s)]
*  Instantly. So one of the reasons that I really [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6120.24s)]
*  passionately dislike Apple and Google is because they'll take your communications and give them [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6124.72s)]
*  to the government without telling you. Yes. In fact, out of this FISA bill just passed, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6130.24s)]
*  they're not even allowed to tell you that your stuff has been accessed by this random federal [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6137.6s)]
*  agency or whatever. So it's just a... It is a big brother expansion bill is what that was. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6143.2s)]
*  And this, I mean, luck or timing or I don't know, anticipating where the problem is going to be. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6149.52s)]
*  Started this journey three years ago. We're now here. It's not hypothetical anymore. These [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6155.6s)]
*  are available and we've just shipped 3,500 of them and there's a few Fs. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6161.92s)]
*  You see this in civil suits too. Not that I'm speaking from experience, but the people [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6166.96s)]
*  who oppose you can wind up with all your text messages. And then it's a short trip from there [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6174.4s)]
*  to say the New York Times. Exactly. And a text without a context is a pretext for trouble. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6178.4s)]
*  Oh, I love that. A text without a context is a pretext for trouble. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6184.24s)]
*  Yep. Luckily in my case, I wasn't really doing anything wrong other than using naughty language. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6187.92s)]
*  But... All the better to have a burn time on all those messages. So it's not looked at a year or [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6191.36s)]
*  five years later with some completely different lens. Well, I agree with that. I agree with that. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6199.04s)]
*  Because... Right. And so, and again, nothing is stored... It's either on your device, [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6201.839999999999s)]
*  if you send me a message, it's on this device or your device. And we can set a burn time where [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6207.360000000001s)]
*  it's gone, unrecoverable anytime, anywhere. But the feds can never come to you and say, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6212.8s)]
*  as the owner and spokesman for Unplugged, we want the text messages for so-and-so. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6218.160000000001s)]
*  We got nothing, man. We store nothing. It's stored on your device or this device. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6222.64s)]
*  Whereas Apple, if I use iMessage, which I do... Correct. And you can set a burn time on this [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6228.8s)]
*  where it disappears and it's gone. So if I'm... This is my grubby iPhone. But if I'm texting on [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6234.56s)]
*  iMessage and... They're storing all of it. Yeah. I got 59 text messages while we were talking this [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6241.280000000001s)]
*  morning. That's why you're so slow to respond to the texts. You're deluged. Well, it's also my [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6249.92s)]
*  birthday. So lots of people are texting me. But anyway, the point is, and I don't have any [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6257.6s)]
*  unauthorized birthday messages, but that's a lot. I mean, people conduct their own speak for [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6262.56s)]
*  myself. I conduct my life through text message. Exactly. Apple has all of that. For all eternity. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6268.56s)]
*  And they will happily give that to the government. Without question. And now they're compelled to [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6274.72s)]
*  turn it over without even a warrant or probable cause. So again, if people are sick of that... [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6279.92s)]
*  So users of Unplugged are protected from that, invulnerable. There's no... That can never happen. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6287.280000000001s)]
*  If they're using Unplugged Messenger. If you send a regular text on Unplugged, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6291.04s)]
*  it's going to pass through a phone carrier. Right. They'll have that message. But if you [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6294.96s)]
*  send a message on Unplugged Messenger, gone. You can set a burn time on it and it's gone and [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6298.72s)]
*  unrecoverable. Not stored by us or anybody else. Well, that seems like freedom to me. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6305.12s)]
*  I will always choose freedom. Amen. And fight like crazy for it. So let me just end this with [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6311.04s)]
*  kind of an apology for interrupting you in the middle of one of the most interesting things you [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6317.04s)]
*  were saying. So I said, name three places that Americans are not paying attention to since you [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6322.72s)]
*  are... I don't want to violate your privacy by saying where you are, but I just happen to know [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6328.8s)]
*  that you're in places I can't even find them on a map and I'm pretty good at geography. So I think [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6332.400000000001s)]
*  you are the person to ask, what are three places that we're not paying attention to that we ought [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6337.360000000001s)]
*  to be in the... I interrupted you after the first one because it was so interesting and you said [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6343.04s)]
*  Mexico. Mexico, fentanyl, the CCP very much promoting... So AMLO is a super socialist [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6346.72s)]
*  president there now. Yeah. There's an even worse leftist female about to take over. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6353.84s)]
*  And absolute... Leftist female. I love how you describe her. She's very much a [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6360.32s)]
*  Marxist protege. Oh, she is. No, she's a leftist female for sure. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6367.04s)]
*  Sure. With active programs by the CCP to support the most leftist candidates there [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6369.84s)]
*  in Mexico, that's a problem. It's become more and more of a narco state with cartels having [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6378.24s)]
*  very significant influence, if not control locally or regionally throughout the country. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6387.84s)]
*  And that's literally our southern border and the AMLO government actively promoting [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6393.92s)]
*  and cooperating with that kind of CCP nonsense. Positive note, just a right-wing guy [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6405.44s)]
*  elected in Panama who says he's going to shut the Darien Gap, which is the area that moves all kinds [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6412.16s)]
*  of people. Now, you asked for three. I might give you a couple more than three if you've got time. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6418.32s)]
*  Please do. The active spend of NGOs that the US government funds, which enables mass migration [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6426.48s)]
*  into Latin America to walk north to invade across our southern border is massive and disgusting and [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6437.28s)]
*  illegal and wrong. I remember three months ago I was contacted by an NGO in Haiti asking if I could [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6445.36s)]
*  organize an aircraft to fly from Port-au-Prince to Managua daily. I said, why on earth would you want [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6453.2s)]
*  to do that? They said, well, Haitians can fly to Nicaragua visa-free. I said, ah, I know why. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6459.759999999999s)]
*  It's to facilitate Haitians coming to Nicaragua and then walking north to facilitate illegal [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6466.0s)]
*  migration from there. Do we have a Haitian shortage here? I don't think so, no. There is a [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6471.28s)]
*  massive network of those NGOs. Some of those guys are making, the CEOs of these things are making [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6481.36s)]
*  a million dollars a year taking US taxpayer money facilitating the maneuver entrance [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6486.8s)]
*  of illegal migrants into the United States funded by the US taxpayers. It's disgusting. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6494.5599999999995s)]
*  And if Republicans actually have the power of the purse, the season to stop. And the fact that they [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6500.5599999999995s)]
*  don't means we have a uniparty problem. So we probably need a melee type solution of a complete [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6505.44s)]
*  change in parties to fix this. I agree completely. But you do sort of wonder since there's no economic [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6511.28s)]
*  justification for this level, millions of uneducated people from the poorest countries of the world [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6517.2s)]
*  coming to your country. There's no, especially with AI, like there are no jobs for these people. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6523.2s)]
*  They're just. But just the fact that the Democrats were actively seeking to register them as voters [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6526.639999999999s)]
*  and to make it possible to vote. You know exactly what they're doing. They're trying to stack the [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6531.44s)]
*  deck. But I mean, you've been around wars your whole life. Like you tell me if you've got the [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6535.679999999999s)]
*  mass movement of young military age males into a country, some of them with prison records, like [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6540.32s)]
*  what are you looking at here? Yeah. Like, does that make you nervous at all? Sure. But I mean, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6546.32s)]
*  I'm not. But I also know. Canon fodder doesn't do very well against a sophisticated capability. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6553.12s)]
*  Yeah. And the fact is the people that actually did the fighting and the dying and the hard combat [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6563.44s)]
*  in the last 20 years, they don't agree to that kind of nonsense because they've laid their lives [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6570.0s)]
*  and their brothers and their health on the line for America for a long time. And they're not going [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6575.68s)]
*  to sit quietly about that nonsense. But I mean, so but there's already an effort in the Congress [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6582.32s)]
*  to make illegal aliens citizens if they serve in the US military. I'm not opposed to a longer term [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6587.5199999999995s)]
*  legionnaire type program. If someone comes here and actually serves and with obviously very, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6598.48s)]
*  very strict performance guidelines. I mean, you're not not don't hire a guy to be a truck driver [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6603.44s)]
*  in the in the army and get citizenship. No. But I'm not so opposed to that. But all the other stuff [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6608.320000000001s)]
*  they want to do around voting and driver's licenses and all that stuff, there's a lot of actions that [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6615.6s)]
*  the next administration can take to make it very difficult for those illegals to remain here by [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6620.320000000001s)]
*  de-banking and de-platforming them. What the left has been doing to people like us for the last 20 [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6626.8s)]
*  years to make that difficult. Okay, so Latin America, big problem in Guyana, country most [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6633.44s)]
*  people haven't heard about other than where Jim Jones served Kool-Aid, made the largest energy [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6640.32s)]
*  discovery in the last in this hemisphere in the last 50 years. So it's enormous. And Venezuela [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6645.599999999999s)]
*  has been now declared that 70% of Guyana's territory is theirs, dusting off a 130 year [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6651.759999999999s)]
*  old border dispute. And I think you're going to see Venezuela annex or seize that with largely [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6659.92s)]
*  impunity in the coming months or year certainly. If the Democrat administration continues, [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6669.52s)]
*  they'll take it because there's no consequences for it. And so you're really seeing a complete [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6679.4400000000005s)]
*  collapse, an erasure of the Monroe Doctrine, this idea that what happens in the Western [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6683.76s)]
*  Hemisphere is America's business and not the business of Russia and China. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6689.76s)]
*  The collapse of credibility of France and of the United States in Africa is now really accelerating. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6695.68s)]
*  The jihad problem that was persistent in Mali and Burkina Faso, in Niger, [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6705.68s)]
*  and why do these countries matter? Huge gold, huge uranium, other minerals there, and now Chad, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6712.88s)]
*  Sudan, the US had two big bases in Niger and they were just pushed out, cost a billion plus easily. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6719.4400000000005s)]
*  Big air bases, drone bases that were trying to do CT support all across Africa, pushed out by a [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6730.8s)]
*  collapse of credibility by the US, by the French, and the Russians have pushed in. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6738.32s)]
*  And the Russians are using a Wagner capability, a hybrid private military company type capability [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6745.36s)]
*  to enable the expansion of military capability in those countries while at the same time, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6752.4s)]
*  a voracious appetite for gold and other minerals, uranium of high value there. And so you're seeing [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6758.4s)]
*  to me it's a reversion to the norm of what you saw in the 1600s. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6765.12s)]
*  I was just thinking that exact same thing as the dollar declines, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6770.5599999999995s)]
*  of course gold becomes more important. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6775.04s)]
*  Yes, gold and uranium and actual green energy. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6777.68s)]
*  So there's nothing really that new in warfare, just different, maybe a little bit of different [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6783.68s)]
*  tech that changes how things are done, but how nations interact with each other. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6789.599999999999s)]
*  I think you'll see a return to privateers and to a lot more private sector because our big bloated [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6794.24s)]
*  super state federal government has proven, well, at least now for the last 30 years, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6801.44s)]
*  it's not very good at putting the fires out. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6805.919999999999s)]
*  Civilizations. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6809.04s)]
*  Managing the conflict doesn't work. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6809.839999999999s)]
*  Clearing the decks and putting a tourniquet on some of these things is necessary. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6814.639999999999s)]
*  Last question, it does seem like civilizations in retreat in a lot of places, order, free movement, [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6819.84s)]
*  relatively open markets, civility, self-restraint, just all this for the hallmarks of an open [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6830.400000000001s)]
*  society of Western civilization, they all seem to be in decline. Do you see that and are you worried [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6837.92s)]
*  about it? [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6844.8s)]
*  Yeah, look, civilizations ebb and flow. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6845.52s)]
*  And I look for pockets of normalcy of however crazy things get, people still figure out how to [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6848.0s)]
*  get on with it and carry on. And there's certainly pockets within Europe where they still do that. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6855.84s)]
*  There's pockets in parts of the Middle East. There's even some pockets in South Africa [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6861.76s)]
*  that I would consider islands of normalcy. And in Latin America as well. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6868.4800000000005s)]
*  What a spectacular man who just took on his entire political establishment and said, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6873.44s)]
*  afuera, out. So I recommend the book a lot, it's called To Dare and To Conquer. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6879.44s)]
*  And a friend gave it to me years ago and it's a history of special operations throughout history, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6887.5199999999995s)]
*  all the way from Alexander the Great and his men that climbed Sagdian Rock, [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6893.2s)]
*  to the present of a few picked men and women, very capable warriors that flew in the face of [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6897.92s)]
*  unsurmountable odds and made it happen and change world history. So I think there's a lot of hope [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6904.400000000001s)]
*  in that. And big government is really dumb and quite plotting. And I know folks that have worked [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6910.08s)]
*  in Google and Apple and they pull their heads out and say, well, we're going to do this, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6918.8s)]
*  I know folks that have worked in Google and Apple and they pull their hair out at how [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6923.76s)]
*  inane and stupid a lot of those things are. And so I view them probably as dumb as the US was in [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6928.8s)]
*  Afghanistan. And an opponent that can be defeated with wily, creative, very focused. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6933.84s)]
*  My dad always told me persistence and determination. And I try to live by that. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6943.52s)]
*  And I come back to my favorite quote from Churchill. And he said, he was speaking [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6948.4s)]
*  before the Canadian parliament a year after the Battle of Britain said, he said, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6956.719999999999s)]
*  a year ago, Hitler said he would ring the neck of the British people like a chicken [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6960.4s)]
*  in six weeks. And I stand before you a year later and I say some chicken, some neck. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6964.48s)]
*  Eric Prince, thank you. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6973.28s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPNqby0AGI&t=6975.12s)]
