# Big Pharma Is Fooling You Again, and You Don't Even Know It
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8)
*  You'd think less than two years after the very public failure of the COVID vaccines [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=0.0s)]
*  that more people in this country would be skeptical of brand new pharma products. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=4.64s)]
*  And maybe they are, but they don't seem very skeptical of Ozempic, which is a diabetes [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=9.36s)]
*  drug that apparently, at least in the short term, can help people lose weight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=14.96s)]
*  And on one level, you can see why they're not skeptical. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=17.64s)]
*  This is a very fat country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=19.76s)]
*  That's a huge problem. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=22.04s)]
*  And a lot of people, a lot of us wouldn't mind losing 20 pounds by taking a pill. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=23.32s)]
*  So why shouldn't we? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=29.08s)]
*  Well, we thought it'd be interesting to hear the other side, a side that you were not hearing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=30.36s)]
*  on the question of Ozempic from someone who knows a lot about it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=34.06s)]
*  Cali Means is the founder of TruMed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  He once worked for Pharma. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=39.08s)]
*  He definitely does not now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=40.08s)]
*  And he joins us today in studio. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=41.76s)]
*  Cali, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=42.76s)]
*  Pumped to be here, Tucker. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=43.76s)]
*  So you want to lose 20, and I'm speaking from experience, you want to lose 20 pounds, you [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=45.72s)]
*  don't really want to stop eating pizza. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=49.2s)]
*  This seems like a super quick way to get healthier. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=51.64s)]
*  Why wouldn't you take Ozempic? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=55.8s)]
*  Why shouldn't I take Ozempic? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  There's three big reasons Ozempic is very problematic. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=58.36s)]
*  And I think really the Rosetta Stone to understanding what's gone wrong in healthcare and frankly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=60.72s)]
*  pharma industry corruption. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=64.2s)]
*  The first point I want to make is that if a fish tank is dirty, you clean the tank, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=66.26s)]
*  you don't drug the fish. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=71.58s)]
*  And in America right now- [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=73.48s)]
*  So they won't notice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=74.48s)]
*  In America right now, we've got a very dirty tank. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=75.68s)]
*  50% of teens and 80% of adults are overweight. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=79.2s)]
*  And this has happened in just a generation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=83.88s)]
*  We didn't become systematically lazier in the past generation as Americans and frankly [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=85.52s)]
*  suicidal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=89.88s)]
*  Something has happened. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=91.6s)]
*  And the core mistake of Ozempic is that obesity is not an Ozempic deficiency. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=92.96s)]
*  Obesity is not the root cause of the problem. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=98.3s)]
*  Obesity is one branch of the tree of underlying metabolic dysfunction that's ravaging our [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=101.08s)]
*  country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=106.36s)]
*  As we talked about with over 50% of Americans having pre-diabetes now, 33% of young adults- [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=107.58s)]
*  Wait, most Americans have pre-diabetes? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=112.52s)]
*  Oh, by some measures it's up to 60%- [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Of the whole country? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Of adults and 33% of young adults and teens. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  And you have a diabetes doctor just a generation ago wouldn't see one child in their entire [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=124.02s)]
*  careers with diabetes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=129.2s)]
*  Now diabetes, which again is cellular dysfunction, is cellular disruption, totally caused by [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=131.32s)]
*  environmental factors in what we're eating. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=137.88s)]
*  Close to becoming, right, upwards of 50% of kids. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=141.84s)]
*  It's 33% and growing radically. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=144.56s)]
*  Teens 25% have fatty liver disease, which is something you only used to see in elderly [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=147.44s)]
*  alcoholics. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=151.88s)]
*  So there's a metabolic health crisis that's caused by decisions. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=152.88s)]
*  The USDA, which is completely corrupt, the guidelines that set nutrition standards, 95% [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=158.4s)]
*  of the guideline committees paid for by food companies, they say that a two-year-old, that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  10% of their diet can be added sugar. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=166.56s)]
*  We have more money from agriculture subsidies in America today go to cigarettes, go to tobacco [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=169.0s)]
*  than vegetables. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=173.56s)]
*  90% of subsidies go to highly processed food. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=174.84s)]
*  We've propped this industry up. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=177.4s)]
*  Food stamps, which 15% of Americans depend on for nutrition, 10% of all food stamps funding [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=179.48s)]
*  goes to soda. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=185.2s)]
*  We're the only country in the world that allows that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=186.2s)]
*  Goes to soda? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=188.4s)]
*  Goes to soda. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=189.4s)]
*  So the- [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=190.4s)]
*  Does the US government pays people to drink soda? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=191.4s)]
*  The US government direct from the federal treasury, more than $10 billion per year go [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=193.76s)]
*  from the federal treasury to soda companies through the food stamp program. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=198.96s)]
*  The number one item purchased with food stamps in America is addictive diabetes water. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=202.88s)]
*  We prop that up with food stamps. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=207.84s)]
*  As we talked about last time, I actually used to work and consult with Coke and we pay the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=209.8s)]
*  NAACP and other groups to say it was racist to take that away. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=213.8s)]
*  We totally rigged the debate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=218.78s)]
*  So through a corrupt system, we actually subsidize soda. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=219.88s)]
*  We do 10 of these things. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=222.94s)]
*  We do 10 easily identifiable things that are causing us frankly to be poisoned. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=225.02s)]
*  And instead of talking about the root cause, we're saying that a weekly injection that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=229.5s)]
*  you have to take for your entire life that costs $20,000 per patient when 80% of American [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=233.66s)]
*  adults are overweight or obese, we're saying that is the answer for obesity. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=241.26s)]
*  We have a dirty tank and pharma has basically changed our consensus reality to say when [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=247.42s)]
*  all of these things are happening all at once due to environmental factors, our savior, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=253.89999999999998s)]
*  you do the math on $20,000 per patient, 80% of American adults. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=258.58s)]
*  We're talking, and this is clear on Wall Street, food stocks are going down, pharma stocks [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=263.46s)]
*  are going up because they're doing cartwheels on Wall Street. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=267.78s)]
*  This is on track because of government funding, because we are standing to put trillions of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=270.7s)]
*  funding into this drug to be the most successful drug in American history. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=274.82s)]
*  So what ... Wow. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=280.46s)]
*  There's a lot there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=282.7s)]
*  But let me just get back to the individual decision to take or not to take this drug. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=284.08s)]
*  So you're overweight, you have pre-diabetes, and your doctor says what you would say, which [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  is that's a very serious thing to have. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=294.94s)]
*  Just because it's common doesn't mean it's not bad. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=297.46s)]
*  It is bad. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  And this drug can cure it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=300.12s)]
*  Why wouldn't you do that? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=301.26s)]
*  Segway's really well into the second issue why ozepic is so problematic. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=302.58s)]
*  So on a societal level, I think anyone that agrees, if you're just looking at this issue, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=306.34s)]
*  putting everybody and pumping everyone with ozepic for their lives isn't the first thing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=313.06s)]
*  you do to solve obesity. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=315.94s)]
*  But even if it was perfect, even if it was perfect, but the problem is when you get to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=317.32s)]
*  the individual level, this drug medically is a absolute disaster. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=321.86s)]
*  Medically? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=327.14s)]
*  Medically it's a disaster. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=328.14s)]
*  So all you need to know is that Novo Nordics, the company that makes this drug, recently [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=329.1s)]
*  passed LVMH to become the most valuable company in Europe. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=333.56s)]
*  So this company, most valuable company in Europe, they don't allow this drug for obesity [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=343.6s)]
*  Almost all of Novo Nordics revenue is coming from taking advantage of Americans. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  This is not the first line of defense for obesity in any European country. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=348.94s)]
*  It's not approved by the government regulators. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=354.0s)]
*  They are saying on their stock calls that all of their growth is coming from the US. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=356.9s)]
*  They're taking advantage of a broken US system in the United States. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=361.9s)]
*  And when you dive into it, even people in the United States who are getting government [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=365.5s)]
*  funding, insurance funding for this drug don't have to pay for it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=368.62s)]
*  30% of them go off the drug within three months. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=371.21999999999997s)]
*  So even though they're fully being paid for it, we're being told this is a lifetime drug, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=374.62s)]
*  there's lawsuits coming just reported in the past couple of days on gastrointestinal issues [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  and stomach paralysis. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=382.82s)]
*  The drug itself essentially is stomach paralysis. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=384.46s)]
*  What is stomach paralysis? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=389.35999999999996s)]
*  The drug, what it does is essentially it paralyzes your stomach to make you not be able to process [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=391.02s)]
*  food correctly. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=398.85999999999996s)]
*  And there's studies now saying that that stomach paralysis, the really messing with your ability [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=399.85999999999996s)]
*  to digest food actually stays after you go off the drug. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=404.46s)]
*  So there's lawsuits now with people with severe gastrointestinal issues after coming off the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=407.78s)]
*  drugs that's being pronounced and that's coming out in lawsuits. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=412.34s)]
*  Additionally, because of that, you're consistently seeing patients who go off the drugs gain [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=416.61999999999995s)]
*  the weight back. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=421.38s)]
*  So that's almost, I think, universally accepted even by Novonorix. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=422.82s)]
*  When you go off the drug, you gain the weight back. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=426.7s)]
*  But again, we're seeing most people that take the drug within the first year come off it [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=429.5s)]
*  because the gastrointestinal issues, the stomach issues are so pronounced. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=433.44s)]
*  Additionally, the EU, again, where this company is based, just launched a probe into suicidal [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=438.74s)]
*  ideation caused by Ozempic. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=444.90000000000003s)]
*  You can't even make this up. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=447.46000000000004s)]
*  But the EU is doing a massive probe because there's so many reports of increased depression [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=448.98s)]
*  and increased suicide. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=455.22s)]
*  Now, I was debating a Harvard doctor about six months ago and I brought this up because [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=456.22s)]
*  it's kind of obvious. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=459.82s)]
*  Your serotonin, what produces your contipid and happiness, 95% is made in the gut. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=461.32s)]
*  And again, Ozempic essentially is gut dysfunction. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=466.28s)]
*  So when you mess with the serotonin and mess with the gut, a lot of unexpected things happening. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=469.61999999999995s)]
*  And very understandably, and really what's to be expected is we're actually seeing reports [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=474.55999999999995s)]
*  of a mass increase in mental health disorders and even suicidal ideation from Ozempic. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  Kind of you just back up and ask, this miracle drug is too good to be true. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=487.55999999999995s)]
*  It's really coming through- [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=491.41999999999996s)]
*  Wait, so you're saying there could be a downside, it's not perfect? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=492.41999999999996s)]
*  30% of people. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  But I want to say this, and I'm a libertarian. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  I think people should be able to take Ozempic. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=502.76000000000005s)]
*  I think most drugs should be legal, frankly. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=504.8s)]
*  The problem is where the rubber really hits the road is there is an all out assault to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=507.86s)]
*  convince us that this is the appropriate drug. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=514.36s)]
*  Again, this is the target market. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=517.0400000000001s)]
*  This is why the stocks are popping and why Wall Street's going crazy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=518.7s)]
*  It's the biggest TAM, the biggest target market for any drug in American history. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=522.08s)]
*  It's 80% of American adults. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=526.64s)]
*  But it's being fast tracked. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=528.4s)]
*  You wouldn't believe this, but the American Academy of Pediatrics recently said that they [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=530.0s)]
*  recommend this as a first line of defense for teens. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=534.8s)]
*  And the study basing that decision for the American Academy of Pediatrics to say that [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=539.2399999999999s)]
*  every obese or overweight teen, which is 50%, should take this drug was a 68 week study. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=543.88s)]
*  We had a 68 week study for a lifetime recommendation to 50% of teens in America to receive these [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=549.76s)]
*  injections. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=555.6s)]
*  So I guess nothing would surprise me coming from the American Academy of Pediatrics, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=556.6s)]
*  which seems really like a vector for badness, given their performance during COVID. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=561.36s)]
*  However, you just still have to wonder how did that happen? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  That seems reckless. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=571.2s)]
*  How could a body like that, which has some residual moral authorities because of its [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=572.32s)]
*  name, how could they do that? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=575.6s)]
*  You are transitioning perfectly into the third point, which is that the reason Ozempic, I [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=578.44s)]
*  think, is such a important story in America today is because it's really, again, it's [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=583.56s)]
*  the Rosetta Stone of understanding corruption. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=589.0s)]
*  Our institutions, particularly the healthcare industry, has completely let us down. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=591.92s)]
*  And you just step back and think about it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  Pharma is the largest spender on TV news ads. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=599.1999999999999s)]
*  It's the largest spender, NovoNorik specifically is the largest spender on foundational obesity [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=603.3599999999999s)]
*  research. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=607.4s)]
*  spender on medical to medical groups like the AAP. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=609.6s)]
*  It's one of the largest funders of actual civil rights groups. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=613.72s)]
*  So you actually can't even believe this, but NovoNorik is paying the NAACP to say that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=617.64s)]
*  not supporting Ozempic is a civil rights issue. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=624.64s)]
*  So you're racist if you're against giving kids a diabetes drug? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=627.52s)]
*  It's on the NAACP website and the NAACP is a registered lobbyist for Ozempic saying [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=630.44s)]
*  that you are a racist because there's disproportionate issues with obesity in certain communities, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  that you're a racist for not supporting government funding for Ozempic. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=644.36s)]
*  Of course. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=649.5s)]
*  And the NAACP takes money from the drug maker? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  They're a registered lobbyist for the drug maker. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=653.96s)]
*  How can the NAACP be a registered lobbyist? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=657.84s)]
*  They have a lobbying organization. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=660.88s)]
*  They have to declare who their lobbying clients are. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=662.44s)]
*  And as reported in NPR very recently, they are registered as a lobbyist for NovoNorik. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=665.2s)]
*  And on their website, they're saying it is an example of systemic racism to not support [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=670.76s)]
*  federal funding for Ozempic. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=676.28s)]
*  So this is what I saw working for Pharma. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=679.4s)]
*  You just have to ask who people trust. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=681.16s)]
*  People trust the medical groups, they trust civil rights groups, they trust the media. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=683.0s)]
*  You have a situation where additionally, NovoNorik, and this is reported, has given $30 million [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=686.76s)]
*  in direct bribes to obesity doctors. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=693.96s)]
*  You would be hard pressed to find a doctor who treats obesity in this country who has [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=697.76s)]
*  not received some kind of donation, not research grants, but direct consulting grants from [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  NovoNorik. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=707.48s)]
*  Like just sending them cash? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=708.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=709.48s)]
*  How can doctors take cash from drug makers? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=710.48s)]
*  Oh, this is what's done. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=712.64s)]
*  The drug makers spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year in direct cash payments [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=714.4s)]
*  to doctors. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=718.6s)]
*  But you can't get the drug except with a script written by the doctor. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=719.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=722.4399999999999s)]
*  Who take direct consulting fees from- [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  How can that be legal? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=726.8s)]
*  This is what you watch things about the opioid crisis and how the opioid completes the same [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=728.12s)]
*  playbook. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=733.48s)]
*  I actually, when I was working for Pharma, the opioid crisis was in full effect. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=734.48s)]
*  And there was a panel in 2012. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=739.28s)]
*  And the panel was full of outside experts recommending guidance on opioids. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=741.94s)]
*  The head of that panel was a man named Dr. Philip Pizzo, who was the Dean of Stanford [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=745.6400000000001s)]
*  Med School at the time. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=749.7s)]
*  He was a pain specialist. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=750.7s)]
*  At the moment he was appointed to that panel, Stanford received a grant from Pfizer, who's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=752.2800000000001s)]
*  one of the largest opioid makers, of $3 million for pain research. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=755.62s)]
*  He appointed 90% of that panel, who are also conflicted to receive direct research and [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=759.48s)]
*  personal consulting fees from opioid makers, and they released relaxed opioid standards. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=763.6s)]
*  This is exactly what's happening on obesity. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=769.0600000000001s)]
*  You have Dr. Fatima Stamford, the head of obesity research at Harvard, pay tens of thousands [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=771.06s)]
*  of dollars by Novonortics, just started a new- [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=775.7399999999999s)]
*  Directly? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=778.7399999999999s)]
*  Directly. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=779.7399999999999s)]
*  Not to mention, of course, millions of dollars of research grants. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=780.7399999999999s)]
*  She's been paid tens of thousands of dollars. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=783.52s)]
*  Well, how can Harvard allow that? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=784.7399999999999s)]
*  There are no conflict of interest rules in medicine. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=787.02s)]
*  Harvard is supporting her. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=790.0999999999999s)]
*  And the NIH recently, it came out that 8,000 research grants went to university professors [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=792.4s)]
*  who also have a direct conflict of interest with the topic and the drug they're studying. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=798.38s)]
*  How can the doc, I mean, how can you be a physician, even a teaching physician, and [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=803.54s)]
*  do that? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=808.74s)]
*  I mean, that's so obviously unethical. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=809.74s)]
*  It's so obvious. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=811.54s)]
*  It's so omnipresent that this isn't discussed. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=813.54s)]
*  I mean, you're saying this like, it's obvious. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=817.6999999999999s)]
*  It's manifestly obvious. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=820.9s)]
*  You hear this, most Americans are outraged. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=821.9s)]
*  This is like, you know, you're swimming in water. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=823.9s)]
*  You don't realize you're in water. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=825.9799999999999s)]
*  This is how academia is. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=827.02s)]
*  The food industry, if you're taking it to food, which is making you sick, spends 11 [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=828.86s)]
*  times more on foundational nutrition research than the NIH. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=833.02s)]
*  Pharma is the lifeblood of foundational scientific research in this country. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=837.34s)]
*  And then you get to the NIH, of course, it's a revolving door between government and industry. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=843.28s)]
*  And the vast majority of NIH grants go to pharma research. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=849.74s)]
*  So the NIH is basically a grant-making organization. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=853.9399999999999s)]
*  This is just statistical, almost all going to research that has conflicts of interest [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=856.9s)]
*  with pharmaceutical drugs. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=860.74s)]
*  The problem here is that every institution, all these institutions fundamentally make [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=861.74s)]
*  more money when we're sick. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=866.5799999999999s)]
*  Ozympoch doesn't cure obesity. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=868.6999999999999s)]

*  Statins don't. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=873.66s)]
*  I'm sorry, I should have asked the answer. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=874.66s)]

*  Is that as advertised? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=878.06s)]
*  Oh, no, no, that's- [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=879.06s)]
*  So if I sign up for Ozympoch tomorrow, the physician will tell me you've got to take [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=880.06s)]
*  this forever. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=883.46s)]
*  Those are the instructions, yes. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=884.46s)]
*  They admit that there's unknown metabolic problems if you go off. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=886.3000000000001s)]
*  That's on the box. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=893.4200000000001s)]
*  No, no, this is a lifetime injection. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=894.4200000000001s)]
*  The key thing here, Tucker, and again, getting the corruption, you're paying off the doctors, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=896.4200000000001s)]
*  you're paying off the medical groups. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=901.94s)]
*  50% of TV news funding. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=903.5s)]
*  I mean, I think it's- [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=905.26s)]
*  Oh, I've seen it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=906.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=907.74s)]
*  And there's, RFK's talked about this back in the day with Roger Ailes. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=908.74s)]
*  When 50% of your bills, since we can acquire here, but 50% of your bills are paid by a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=912.26s)]
*  certain interest, why didn't the news media have any curiosity during COVID, why people [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=918.66s)]
*  were dying of COVID? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=925.16s)]
*  Metabolically healthy people weren't dying of COVID. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=926.82s)]
*  This is where the corruption and really where it all ties together. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=929.36s)]
*  I'm sorry, will you describe that in a little more detail? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=932.14s)]
*  We had probably the biggest event in American history since World War II, where we shut [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=935.58s)]
*  down the country where we really, I think, showed our weakness just physically and mentally [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=939.86s)]
*  as Americans. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=945.72s)]
*  American COVID deaths were substantially higher than other countries and research, it's not [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=946.72s)]
*  argued, has come out saying that COVID was a foodborne illness. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=951.38s)]
*  Dying of COVID was a foodborne illness. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=955.8000000000001s)]
*  If you were metabolically healthy, if you had stable cholesterol, stable fasting glucose, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=958.3000000000001s)]
*  weren't obese, you didn't die of COVID. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=962.7s)]
*  We did disproportionately, overwhelmingly, even among older people, affected people with [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=965.42s)]
*  comorbidities, and we are a lot sicker in America. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=969.66s)]
*  The comorbidities were caused by eating bad food. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=972.9s)]
*  Comorbidities are obesity, heart disease, diabetes. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=977.14s)]
*  Those are the main comorbidities. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=981.78s)]
*  If you did not have those, you were essentially not impacted by COVID and had almost 0% chance [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=983.9799999999999s)]
*  of dying of COVID. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=989.6999999999999s)]
*  The media though, who's heavily funded by pharmaceutical companies, didn't have any [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=991.22s)]
*  curiosity about that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=996.62s)]
*  Didn't have any curiosity. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=997.62s)]
*  Maybe this is a 9-11 moment that we're not at our best as America. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=999.02s)]
*  We are a sick, depressed, infertile population. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1003.7s)]
*  Sperm count is down 50% in just the past generation. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1006.7s)]
*  25% of women now have PCOS, leading cause of infertility. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1010.46s)]
*  We are having trouble reproducing as a species. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1013.4s)]
*  These are all connected. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1017.58s)]
*  There was a moment to talk about this. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1018.74s)]
*  But instead, the media, the government institutions who are paid by pharma, pushed a pharmaceutical [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1021.02s)]
*  solution with trillions of dollars of airtime as the solution to our crisis. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1027.34s)]
*  This was one of the greatest public policy mistakes in American history. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1033.54s)]
*  After coming off of the worst public policy failure, I think one of the worst in American [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1037.74s)]
*  history with the COVID response on every level, keeping the bars open and shutting down the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1043.3s)]
*  schools to pushing an effective pharmaceutical solution instead of root cause solutions. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1047.86s)]
*  We're being asked to trust pharma when 80% of the American people, their bodies are rebelling [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1053.62s)]
*  against them with obesity, which are clearly a sign of underlying issues where Ozempic [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1060.34s)]
*  and weekly shots is not the root cause. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1066.06s)]
*  This just on its face doesn't make sense. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1068.82s)]
*  And then you trace the corruptions. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1070.8999999999999s)]
*  Again, Ozempic is paying off everyone. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1072.82s)]
*  One of the five largest funders, the company itself, one of the five largest funders of [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1077.1000000000001s)]
*  news ads, one of the top research funders of obesity research, largest funders to university [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1080.6200000000001s)]
*  on the obesity topic. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1086.0600000000002s)]
*  The thing I kind of ram home here, Tucker, is you just have to look where the money is. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1087.78s)]
*  If you actually look at the analyst reports that are propping up these stocks, they're [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1094.14s)]
*  assuming an increase in obesity. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1099.3200000000002s)]
*  You talk about all the... [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1101.6200000000001s)]
*  I know of Norwick's largest company in Europe. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1102.62s)]
*  They literally... [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1105.6599999999999s)]
*  Where the money hits the road, where people are investing billions of dollars, they're [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1106.6599999999999s)]
*  assuming increased rates of obesity over the next 10 years in America. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1110.26s)]
*  You actually was talking to a doctor at Harvard. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1114.9799999999998s)]
*  They're underwriting a loan for a new obesity center where they can treat an issue of Ozempic. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1118.1799999999998s)]
*  Those loans have projections for growth of obesity. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1123.8999999999999s)]
*  They're not projecting that increased Ozempic is going to decrease obesity. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1127.1799999999998s)]
*  The loans that are underpinning these medical centers, if you go to any city in the country, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1131.78s)]
*  the biggest, most beautiful building is some kind of new pediatric obesity center or cardiology [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1137.62s)]
*  center. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1143.26s)]
*  The loans assume increased rates of conditions. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1145.22s)]
*  So fundamentally, we have the largest energy in the country, healthcare. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1147.7s)]
*  Imagine the leader saying, how do we reverse obese? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1153.12s)]
*  How do we cure obese? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1155.46s)]
*  They're not asking that. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1156.46s)]
*  They're saying, how can we actually say obesity is not your fault? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1157.46s)]
*  Oprah, who's involved with Weight Watchers, just apologized for preaching personal accountability [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1160.58s)]
*  over the past decades. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1166.54s)]
*  She said, it's not personal accountability. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1167.9399999999998s)]
*  We're supporting Ozempic. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1169.82s)]
*  This is becoming... [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1171.82s)]
*  Obesity is becoming something. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1172.82s)]
*  Do you think Oprah got paid? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1174.1399999999999s)]
*  She's highly involved with Weight Watchers. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1176.26s)]
*  Yeah, Weight Watchers has shifted from a personal accountability organization that it's been [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1178.62s)]
*  preaching for decades and is now a prescriber of Ozempic. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1184.1399999999999s)]
*  They've totally changed because Ozempic is a better business model because you never [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1186.3799999999999s)]
*  go off of it. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1189.36s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1192.12s)]
*  So maybe one of the reasons this is accepted, people don't see it as totally crazy as I [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1193.12s)]
*  do. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1200.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't take Advil, so all of this seems crazy to me. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1201.1999999999998s)]
*  But the average, say, 65 year old person in this country is on how many drugs? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1204.8799999999999s)]
*  About seven. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1211.4799999999998s)]
*  Seven. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1212.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1213.4799999999998s)]
*  And not just intermittently, but like over the years. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1214.4799999999998s)]
*  Quite. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1217.7199999999998s)]
*  90 plus percent of funding for medicine dollars is around chronic lifetime. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1218.72s)]
*  It's more recurring revenue. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1224.52s)]
*  So describe what that looks like, like the scale of it. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1227.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1230.0s)]
*  I think, again, we're so desensitized to this that we don't understand how crazy it is and [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1231.0s)]
*  how much of a failure it's been. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1233.52s)]
*  Well, I'll give you an example of my mom. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1234.52s)]
*  So my mom was 71 for a checkup and was told by the doctor she was healthy. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1236.92s)]
*  the time on seven lifetime medications. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1245.2s)]
*  So she was on maybe a decade before, had high cholesterol, was prescribed a statin. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1250.16s)]
*  And the message from the doctor was, no problem. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1256.44s)]
*  The majority, almost, of people your age are on a statin. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1259.72s)]
*  No problem. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1262.32s)]
*  That's a rite of passage. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1263.32s)]
*  Then she had high fasting glucose. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1264.32s)]
*  Again, that's basically pre-diabetes, which majority people have metformin, one of the [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1265.52s)]
*  most prescribed drugs in the country, high blood pressure. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1269.4s)]
*  So she has these comorbidities that are almost seen as like rites of passage. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1271.6s)]
*  It's a rite of passage for a man over 40 to be on a statin. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1275.0s)]
*  The majority are. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1277.8799999999999s)]
*  So these were all kind of normal things. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1279.8s)]
*  So as we treated everything in silos, that's a lie. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1282.6999999999998s)]
*  Heart disease, diabetes, in many ways, depression, Alzheimer's, they're branches of the same [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1286.9199999999998s)]
*  tree. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1293.56s)]
*  We've actually lied saying those are different conditions, seeing four different doctors [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1295.6399999999999s)]
*  perform different treatments that don't even talk to each other. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1300.76s)]
*  So we're managing the symptoms instead of seeing those symptoms as a gift and realizing [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1303.4s)]

*  The more metformin we prescribe, the more diabetes goes up. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1314.08s)]
*  The more SSRIs we prescribe, which are now 25% of women. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1316.88s)]
*  The higher the suicide rate goes. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1319.72s)]
*  We're seeing skyrocketing. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1321.44s)]
*  So we're siloing everything and literally. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1322.44s)]
*  So there's so many questions. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1325.0s)]
*  So 25% of women are on SSRIs? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1326.4s)]
*  We have a societal dynamic where 25% of women in the United States are on a medication. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1328.68s)]
*  And I'm not just flatly anti-drug, but this is a societal dynamic, Tucker. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1333.92s)]
*  We have 25% of women taking something that fundamentally numbs you out from reality. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1337.96s)]
*  And we don't even blink an eye at that. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1343.0800000000002s)]
*  And depression, mental health disorders, anxiety, suicide. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1344.72s)]
*  Suicide is now the second leading cause of death for young adults. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1348.68s)]
*  SSRIs are- [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1352.16s)]

*  Which I think could be related. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1355.64s)]
*  And SSRIs, you talk to any high schooler now and look in there, it's the first line of [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1357.84s)]
*  defense. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1362.84s)]
*  I mean, it is prescribed like candy when- [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1363.84s)]
*  To children? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1365.04s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1366.04s)]
*  SSRIs. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1367.04s)]
*  Oh, SSRI prescription rates are skyrocketing among teens. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1368.04s)]
*  You talk to any high school counselor, anyone in any high school. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1371.84s)]
*  This is the first line of defense when a child- [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1374.76s)]
*  I would never talk to a high school counselor on any circumstance. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1376.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1378.8s)]
*  Well, that's very smart. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1379.8s)]
*  But yeah, they're skyrocketing among kids. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1380.92s)]
*  And there's actually a black box warning on SSRIs label actually saying that it increases [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1384.32s)]
*  suicidal ideation among children and they're widely prescribed to children. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1390.28s)]
*  Not to mention the fact that 20% of high school seniors are on essentially methamphetamines, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1394.08s)]
*  Adderall, which if you read the book Blitzed, actually traces the history. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1399.04s)]
*  Adderall was developed by Nazi Germany as a tool for Nazi soldiers to be more aggressive [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1404.88s)]
*  and now is prescribed widely along with SSRIs to kids. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1408.76s)]
*  Oh. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1413.8000000000002s)]
*  One thing I'm trying to keep track of everything you're saying, all of which is checkable, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1414.8000000000002s)]
*  I assume on the internet. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1420.88s)]
*  Statin drugs are prescribed to the majority of American men over 40? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1424.24s)]
*  The last rate, I think 2019, the last study I said was 45% and I think there's reports [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1428.8000000000002s)]
*  that now post-COVID it's close to 50%. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1434.76s)]
*  So what's the downside of statin drugs? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1438.52s)]
*  Oh, there's wild research coming out. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1440.76s)]
*  The highest level, just even if the drugs don't have no side effects, heart disease [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1443.52s)]
*  isn't a statin deficiency. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1447.52s)]
*  What stands to me at the most important level represent that we have a moral hazard. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1449.52s)]
*  Fundamentally when you're prescribed that statin, you're told by the doctor that you're [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1455.6s)]
*  doing something. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1459.2s)]
*  When you're prescribed the ozempic, the doctor, Fatima Stanford on 60 Minutes, who's a paid [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1460.24s)]

*  Food isn't the problem. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1468.36s)]
*  It's a medical issue. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1469.8799999999999s)]
*  Take ozempic. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1471.6s)]
*  You're not worried about what you're eating. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1472.6s)]
*  This is exactly what Purdue Pharmacet about pain 20 years ago. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1473.8s)]
*  You have these messages, you have the statins, you're doing something. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1477.32s)]
*  You now can eat what you want to eat. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1480.8s)]

*  You literally have guidance from the American Heart Association, from the American Diabetes [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1502.36s)]
*  Association, now from the obesity industrial complex, saying that if you take these drugs, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1507.68s)]
*  you're good. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1515.04s)]

*  What's the cost of all that? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1525.08s)]
*  Just diabetes. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1526.2s)]
*  Well, with diabetes, this is the root cause. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1527.2s)]
*  Again, it's a misnomer to see this as an isolated condition. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=1530.8799999999999s)]

*  There's 20 of these, but you just have to go to the incentives. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2167.2799999999997s)]
*  You were surprised that the majority of university researchers and NIH grants go to conflicted [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2172.04s)]
*  researchers? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2178.24s)]
*  Yeah, I was shocked. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2179.24s)]
*  Tomorrow, the president could say, we're not going to touch NIH funding, but we're not [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2181.28s)]
*  going to issue grants anymore to people with conflicts of interest. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2186.0s)]
*  That would sound like a reasonable policy to 95% of the American people. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2189.14s)]
*  I think that's unimpeachable bipartisan policy. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2192.2s)]
*  It will cause a conniption. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2194.76s)]
*  The media, the next day, with their talking points, would say it's most anti-science ... [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2197.16s)]
*  NIH funding. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2202.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2203.04s)]
*  You could do that. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2204.04s)]
*  You could change ag subsidies, which are just tens of billions of dollars to process food. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2205.04s)]
*  You could put restrictions on university conflicts of interest, which are essentially R&D labs [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2210.56s)]
*  or pharma. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2215.8399999999997s)]
*  I think a key one, Tucker, and you go back to the American Academy of Pediatrics, this [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2217.8399999999997s)]
*  isn't just some industry group. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2221.7999999999997s)]
*  The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Diabetes Association, and these medical groups [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2223.64s)]
*  have statutory authority to create the standard of care for how we practice medicine in the [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2227.74s)]
*  United States. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2231.06s)]
*  They are funded majority by pharma. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2232.14s)]
*  So the groups that literally have statutory power to create the standard of care for diabetes, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2235.46s)]
*  you just step back. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2240.62s)]
*  Why aren't doctors giving their patients prescriptions for food interventions if they have pre-diabetes? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2241.62s)]
*  Why aren't they giving them and prescribing them and allowing them to use their tax advantage [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2251.02s)]
*  dollars to exercise? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2255.34s)]
*  If you actually follow the science, that would be the correct medical intervention to reverse [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2257.04s)]
*  that. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2261.72s)]
*  But we're so gaslighted by this, it's just not even batting an eye that it's just pill, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2262.72s)]
*  pill, pill. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2267.96s)]
*  Americans follow incentives. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2268.96s)]
*  What we're trying to do at TruMed is a doctor actually can write a note for exercise and [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2271.12s)]
*  food and that actually can open up medical tax advantage dollars and other insurance [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2275.72s)]
*  dollars. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2280.52s)]
*  Doctors could do that, but the second you get someone off the chronic disease treadmill, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2281.52s)]
*  it's not a profitable patient. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2286.64s)]
*  There's nothing more profitable for the pharmaceutical industry than frankly a sick kid. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2288.4s)]
*  You imagine a kid with pre-diabetes, inevitably they're obese, inevitably they have hypertension, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2293.92s)]
*  inevitably they have heart issues. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2297.68s)]
*  They're going to be like my mom much earlier on just a ton of drugs being told on each [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2299.3599999999997s)]
*  of those drugs that you're not curing anything. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2304.2s)]
*  These are conditions you need to manage for life. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2306.6s)]
*  So we're getting people, there's a war to get kids on that bandwagon. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2308.8799999999997s)]
*  We need to have the moral clarity frankly and communicate this like RFK is communicating [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2314.26s)]
*  it. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2319.0600000000004s)]
*  There's something really resonating and at the core of his message is that we've really [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2320.0600000000004s)]
*  lost our way. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2323.6600000000003s)]
*  This is a big issue. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2324.6600000000003s)]
*  This is corruption. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2325.6600000000003s)]
*  It's corruption at the end of the day, which is destroying and profiting off, destroying [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2326.6600000000003s)]
*  our kids, profiting on us being sicker and addicted and depressed quite frankly. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2330.94s)]
*  This is a big issue we need to unwind. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2336.84s)]
*  And frankly, President Trump has made some strong statements about this. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2338.5800000000004s)]
*  I'd say watching the GOP debate, it's like watching a bizarre world. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2341.9s)]
*  Rome is burning in a lot of ways. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2344.94s)]
*  We have a corruption problem and it sounds like there are some cocktail party in 1988, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2346.56s)]
*  GOP cocktail party. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2350.42s)]
*  It's not about the marginal tax rate. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2352.42s)]
*  It's not about the Medicare Part D page 300. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2354.14s)]
*  Our biggest industry, our biggest industry, the healthcare industry is profiting from [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2358.62s)]
*  us being sick. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2364.6600000000003s)]
*  It's just that simple and we need to unwind that or we're going to destroy our human capital [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2365.6600000000003s)]
*  and destroy our budget. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2369.06s)]
*  If people have come to the end of this conversation and want to learn more, I never do this, but [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2371.18s)]
*  I think it's worth it with you for sure. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2375.46s)]
*  How can they learn more about your views on this? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2377.74s)]

*  What would you recommend? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2382.1s)]
*  Well, as we talked about, this is my life's passion with my sister who was a doctor who [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2383.1s)]
*  left the system. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2386.7799999999997s)]
*  I'll announce it right now, I've helped her write a book that's just put on Amazon today [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2387.7799999999997s)]
*  called Good Energy, Unwinding and Unpacking These Issues Using Her Experience in Medicine. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2392.62s)]
*  We put our heart and soul into that book to really unwind these issues, which we think [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2397.02s)]
*  are the most important issues in the country. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2400.82s)]

*  world. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2409.86s)]
*  What we need to do is doctors need to follow the science. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2410.86s)]
*  Doctors need to, when somebody has a metabolic condition, explain to them and incentivize [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2416.1000000000004s)]
*  them to practice better eating, to exercise. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2421.0s)]
*  People listen to doctors. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2424.5800000000004s)]
*  When we were told the food pyramid to eat carbs, we ate carbs. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2426.1800000000003s)]
*  When we were told to take vaccines, we took vaccines. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2429.82s)]
*  When we were told to stop smoking, smoking rates plummeted. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2431.7000000000003s)]
*  We need every doctor and every medical leader, and frankly, I hope leaders like Elon who [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2434.6800000000003s)]
*  care about human capital and our potential, to say we need to unwind this and we need [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2439.6600000000003s)]
*  to get back to root causes in America and talk about food, talk about exercise, talk [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2446.52s)]

*  These policies would transform things. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2452.3s)]
*  You can change your biomarkers in three months if you go on a functional medicine type program [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8&t=2454.1000000000004s)]
