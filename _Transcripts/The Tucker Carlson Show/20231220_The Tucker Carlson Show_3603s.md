**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [December 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM)
*  Okay, so the fact that you two know each other is I guess maybe inevitable but also a little [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=0.0s)]
*  shocking. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=16.44s)]
*  How do you know each other? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=17.56s)]
*  Shocking. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=18.56s)]
*  Well, because it's so perfect. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=19.56s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=20.56s)]
*  It's too perfect. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=21.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=22.56s)]
*  We can actually have a conversation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=23.56s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  I met him in 07. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  What was the last time you met him? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=27.56s)]
*  I met him in 07. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=28.56s)]
*  Warwick Hills. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=29.56s)]
*  This is the only friend I have where I'm the responsible one. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=30.56s)]
*  No, not always. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=34.32s)]
*  More than I am with you, but yeah, you're right about that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=36.4s)]
*  She met on a golf course. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=40.44s)]
*  He came out to Warwick Hills and he was on the 17th hole. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=42.12s)]
*  No, we met years before that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=45.72s)]
*  I didn't even golf. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=47.04s)]
*  High, high. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=48.04s)]
*  I hated golf. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=49.04s)]
*  You're like, why don't you golf? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=50.04s)]
*  I'm like, it's gay. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=51.04s)]
*  Did you get a little gayer once you started? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Oh, I'm completely gay now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=56.12s)]
*  I love golf. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=57.48s)]
*  I got him to play the pro and Warwick Hills. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=61.16s)]
*  All he wanted to do was hit a drive down the middle of the fairway. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=64.32s)]
*  I did. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=67.16s)]
*  First shot. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=68.16s)]
*  You absolutely killed it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=69.16s)]
*  I didn't really golf at the time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=70.16s)]
*  We were just having fun. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=71.96s)]
*  He drives my General Lee up there with my brother. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=72.96s)]
*  It's just a shit show. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=76.72s)]
*  I'm like, let's have some fun. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=77.72s)]
*  I just wear a pair of overalls, crack a beer. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=80.56s)]
*  These sports writers in Detroit are like, do you golf? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I was going to go pro, but the music thing got in the way, so I just focused [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=86.68s)]
*  on it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=91.44s)]
*  I'm just totally bullshitting them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=92.44s)]
*  And I smack one down the middle. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=93.44s)]
*  Just killed it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  No shoes, overalls. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=98.12s)]
*  And so now these guys, until I hit my second shot, I had them all convinced. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=99.92s)]
*  They're like, wow, he could have gone pro. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=103.92s)]
*  And then they figured it out after I hit another ball. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=106.2s)]
*  For that five minutes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=109.64s)]
*  I had them all fooled. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=110.64s)]
*  He walked really slow getting to that ball, too. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=112.64s)]
*  So that was the first time you guys hung out? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=116.8s)]
*  Well, we hung out a little bit, but we became really good friends. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=118.52s)]
*  Probably that, I'd say that week. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=122.64s)]
*  I ended up staying at his place in Clarkston for that tournament every year. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=123.92s)]
*  I stayed at my place every year. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=127.0s)]
*  I used to have to yell. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=128.44s)]
*  One year I was doing shows. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=130.64s)]
*  Pro, pro. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=131.64s)]
*  You and Fuckhead were fucking up in the guest house, just boozing it up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=132.64s)]
*  Who's Fuckhead? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=137.08s)]
*  His caddy, a South African caddy. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=138.08s)]
*  Pro, pro. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=139.88s)]
*  He's funny, though. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=140.88s)]
*  But I'm trying to sleep because I got shows the next day and I don't mess around between [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=141.92s)]
*  shows. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=144.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=145.84s)]
*  Not in the early years. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=146.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was a little different. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=147.84s)]
*  But I stay on my game and I'm like, you guys got to shut up, man. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=149.24s)]
*  I got to play. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  What were they doing? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  Ah, football! [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  Woo! [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  Hey, we stayed in this little guest room up top. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  Had two bedrooms. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=162.6s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=163.6s)]
*  It's probably, I love to cook. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=165.4s)]
*  Oh, they got lasagna going. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=167.0s)]
*  I cook any food all week long. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=168.72s)]
*  Anyway, his oven in there, I don't know how old that sumbitch is, but let me tell you [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  something, I want that oven. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  It's one of the best ovens I've ever cooked in. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=176.11999999999998s)]
*  It's an electric oven. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=177.64s)]
*  Or it was. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=178.64s)]
*  This is my old house outside Detroit. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=179.64s)]
*  Oh, it was amazing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  You sold all that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  Did you keep the oven? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  That thing's vintage. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  Sold it all. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  Pretty much everything in it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  All the signs that are so old when you go on your property and you don't keep a vintage [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  oven like that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=197.04s)]
*  No, I didn't keep the oven. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=198.04s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=199.04s)]
*  I should have stole that, son of a bitch. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=200.6s)]
*  I still got the codes. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=203.6s)]
*  Most people can't appreciate a good oven from a bad oven. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=205.76s)]
*  Oh, I can't. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=208.68s)]
*  So did you kick him out? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=210.72s)]
*  No, I kind of got hard in his shit a little bit because I'm serious about work. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=212.56s)]
*  I think you dropped out of the tournament. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=218.44s)]
*  Like something, he's like, my leg hurts. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  I had to withdraw from the tournament. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=222.0s)]
*  Your leg hurts. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, that wouldn't be that freaking handle of vodka you drank last night, would it? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  No, that actually helped it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=227.84s)]
*  And then he's kind of on the couch. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=228.96s)]
*  I'll never forget this, like a little kid. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=229.96s)]
*  And I had a show we were flying to somewhere and he's like, and I was pissed at him because [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  these shenanigans were going on. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=236.44s)]
*  I love him like a brother. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  But I'm like, he had me upset and he's like, is it okay if I go to the show with you tonight? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=239.32s)]
*  I'm like, no, it's not okay. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  Of course, he ended up going to the show. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  I love him. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Great time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=251.32s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=253.12s)]
*  So you're the moderate restrained advice giving partner in this relationship. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=254.12s)]
*  I do it all the time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=258.36s)]
*  Can you name a time when you've had a pulling back? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  That's that client attorney privilege. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  Whatever the penalty thing is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  I would cook him breakfast every day for the one Buick Open. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  You were doing, I was like, I'd have some eggs made for him, this, that, and the other. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  Oh, thanks, bub. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=282.48s)]
*  He got any diet coke? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  He's like, three diet cokes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm like, I actually almost won that one. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=290.16s)]
*  How many do you drink a day, diet cokes? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=294.72s)]
*  Not as many as Daddy Trump. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=296.88s)]
*  My God, I thought I could drink them, but man, he can drink them. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=297.88s)]
*  He's unbelievable. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=300.8s)]
*  He does put them away. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=301.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=302.8s)]
*  I used to put them away. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=303.8s)]
*  I used to have about 20, 22 of them a day. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=304.8s)]
*  22 diet cokes a day? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=306.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=307.8s)]
*  So you're getting all your hydration from diet coke? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=308.8s)]
*  Pretty much, yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  I could probably outlast a camel when it comes if I have to drink water. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=314.2s)]
*  I can't stand water. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=319.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=320.0s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=321.0s)]
*  See what I'm dealing with here? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=322.0s)]
*  When I drink, you know, on my diet coke, there's ice in there, there's water in there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=324.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=327.8s)]
*  Plenty of water. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=328.8s)]
*  So why'd you pull back? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=329.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=330.8s)]
*  I just don't drink as many. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=331.8s)]
*  I drink a lot of these now, so it makes it better. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=332.8s)]
*  Right, because there's no vodka in diet coke. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=334.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=336.8s)]
*  Well, unless you pour something in there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=337.8s)]
*  Did your doctor, like how many diet cokes can you drink a day and still live? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=338.8s)]
*  He don't want me drinking any. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=343.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=345.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=346.0s)]
*  Is it bad for you? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=347.0s)]
*  For a butter, yeah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=348.0s)]
*  I mean, Trump's like in his 70s. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=349.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he smokes cigarettes, so he kind of balances it out. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=351.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  It's totally right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, nicotine and caffeine equal protein, Tucker. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  You know? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=359.12s)]
*  I've actually proven that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=360.12s)]
*  That is totally true. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=361.12s)]
*  I meant to ask you when we talked earlier, you were talking about your heroes on the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=362.12s)]
*  tour, other golfers you admire. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  Is there anyone you don't like? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=369.64s)]
*  Bernard Langer. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=371.23999999999995s)]
*  I love Bernard. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=372.23999999999995s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=374.08s)]
*  He just kicks my ass. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=375.08s)]
*  I just always give him shit because he always wins all the tournaments. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=376.08s)]
*  Let's put it, me and Curtis Strange never got along. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=377.08s)]
*  What's he like? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=379.04s)]
*  He just wasn't nice to me. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=380.04s)]
*  He just wasn't a nice guy to me. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=381.04s)]
*  Who would not be nice to you? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=383.08s)]
*  Yeah, why? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=384.08s)]
*  He's the nicest guy you've ever met. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=385.08s)]
*  I can tell. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=386.08s)]
*  I was a rookie, and he just didn't like rookies. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=387.08s)]
*  He just didn't like me. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=389.08s)]
*  Then I won the PGA 91, and I stole his caddy at the 91 Skins game. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=391.36s)]
*  Boatsy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  What'd she look like? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  She's pretty hot. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Boatsy was, we won the British Open together in 95. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=400.32s)]
*  He came for me a long time and he passed away. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  God, it was brutal what he went through. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=407.23999999999995s)]
*  He got robbed and they beat him up. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=409.28s)]
*  Next thing I know he was in a wheelchair and he just, I don't know, he got dementia or [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=411.76s)]
*  something. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=416.88s)]
*  It was sad. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=417.88s)]
*  From the beating he took. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=418.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=419.88s)]
*  Where was he robbed? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=420.88s)]
*  At his house in Jacksonville. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=421.88s)]
*  All the flags. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=424.88s)]
*  He won two US Open's with Curtis, won a few tournaments with me. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=425.88s)]
*  He took all his Ryder Cup stuff, all his flags he took off the polls when he won. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=430.24s)]
*  See, a caddy will take the flag off the poll when they win. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=433.68s)]
*  And the pro will sign it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=437.32s)]
*  But yeah, he. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=438.32s)]
*  He tried with us. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=439.32s)]
*  They, it wasn't easy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=440.32s)]
*  No, no. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=441.32s)]
*  And it all got stolen. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=442.32s)]
*  Stolen, robbed him and beat the living hell out of him. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=443.32s)]
*  It was sad. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=447.32s)]
*  And killed him in the end. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=448.32s)]
*  Raped his wife. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=449.32s)]
*  I mean, it was sad. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=450.32s)]
*  Did they ever get caught? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=451.32s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=452.32s)]
*  That's horrifying. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=453.32s)]
*  Oh. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=454.32s)]

*  Oh. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=456.88s)]
*  About that time. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=457.88s)]
*  Way to lighten the mood, Johnny. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=458.88s)]

*  Damn, boy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=466.88s)]
*  The one I'm fixing to commit, maybe. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=467.88s)]

*  You like the bull zippo. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=517.0s)]
*  Crème brûlée and crack cocaine. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=518.6s)]
*  Crème brûlée, yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=520.6s)]

*  We just walk in like we're just in here. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=525.6s)]
*  That's what I love about him. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=528.6s)]
*  He doesn't act like Kid Rock. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=530.6s)]
*  He acts like Bobby. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=531.6s)]
*  He's just a friend. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=532.6s)]
*  We go out to eat. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=533.6s)]
*  People come up a little bit, but most people respect our space. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=535.6s)]
*  People are always like, I love your security guard. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=539.6s)]
*  He's cool. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=542.6s)]
*  That's what he called me, the security guard. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=543.76s)]
*  Have you ever had to hold groupies at bay? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=546.76s)]
*  There's been a few. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=549.76s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=552.76s)]
*  Where were you 15 years ago? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=556.26s)]
*  Are there a lot of groupies in the PGA tour? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=559.26s)]
*  Oh my God, yeah. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=562.26s)]
*  How are golf groupies different from rock and roll groupies? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=564.14s)]
*  Probably the same. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=568.14s)]
*  You think so? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=569.14s)]
*  Yeah, they're all trying to tag on to somebody that's got a thing that got money or has [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=570.14s)]
*  money or whatever. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=573.5s)]
*  I don't partake in that lifestyle. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=577.5s)]
*  I didn't either. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=580.5s)]
*  Are there still groupies in rock and rollers or too much? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=581.5s)]
*  At this stage in the game, you're kind of like, put them away. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=586.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=590.5s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's the stage in your game, of course. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=591.5s)]
*  But 15 years ago, like Tucker, pull them up, pull them up, take your pants off. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=594.5s)]
*  No, but is that still a thing or did Me Too stop all that? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=599.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=602.5s)]
*  I'm in and out when I play. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=603.5s)]
*  No, I get in your case, but I mean like guys who are 32. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=605.5s)]
*  Yeah, why wouldn't there be? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=609.5s)]
*  Because I think honestly, over the years, it's gotten kind of a bit, I mean, how could [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=611.5s)]
*  you do anything in this day and age? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=616.5s)]
*  In terms of, I call it having fun. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=618.5s)]
*  Like whatever we did wild stuff back in the day, there was no victims. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=621.5s)]
*  Everybody wanted to have fun. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=625.5s)]
*  It was just rock and roll. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=627.5s)]
*  You know, I was just setting the other and, you know, I always made it a point myself [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=629.5s)]
*  and with other people, it's like if there was wild stuff happen, like let's treat everybody [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=633.5s)]
*  very kind, very nice. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=637.5s)]
*  There's no reason to be mean. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=639.5s)]
*  Of course. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=640.5s)]
*  Especially in a situation that's weird. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=641.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=643.5s)]
*  You know? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=644.5s)]
*  So the weirdness. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=646.5s)]
*  Everybody was trying to hang out and do those things when I was like playing for 50 people [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=647.5s)]
*  in Cleveland, Ohio. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=651.5s)]
*  You know? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=653.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=654.5s)]
*  I kind of feel bad for the younger generation because it seems like it was kind of looking [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=656.5s)]
*  back and I would think that everybody involved with all the madness that was going on was [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=660.5s)]
*  having a good time. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=667.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=668.5s)]
*  You know? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=669.5s)]
*  We always had a strict policy. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=670.5s)]
*  It's like, hey, you don't mess with somebody's girlfriend or wife. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=671.5s)]
*  Like there's just certain things that are just way out of bounds. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=673.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=676.5s)]
*  But everybody wants to have a good time, especially when you're young. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=677.5s)]
*  But there's just a right and wrong way to do it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=680.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=683.5s)]
*  When you see kids, it's like, you know, I think they're scared to go up and tell a girl, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=684.5s)]
*  you know, like, hey, you're pretty. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=687.5s)]
*  No, they'll text them. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=688.5s)]
*  They're like, ah, you raped me. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=689.5s)]
*  You're like, whoa, whoa, I just told you you were pretty. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=690.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=694.5s)]
*  So I mean, there's not, you can't really have like a Led Zeppelin tour. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=695.5s)]
*  I've been out of the game. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=699.5s)]
*  It's the phones, you know? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=700.5s)]
*  You know, back in the day, you didn't have phones. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=701.5s)]
*  Well, life has turned into a picture. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=703.5s)]
*  It has. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=705.5s)]
*  It's nothing but a picture, a video. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=706.5s)]
*  You know. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=707.5s)]
*  You don't go anywhere. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=708.5s)]
*  People are always looking at you and me, him. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=709.5s)]
*  They're always looking to get us doing something wrong because that makes the news. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=713.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=716.5s)]
*  But if we, you know, give a kid a hundred bucks for selling golf balls and buy all those balls [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=717.5s)]
*  and now you keep them selling, that never gets out anymore. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=722.5s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=725.5s)]
*  You know? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=726.5s)]
*  That doesn't get clicks and views. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=727.5s)]
*  No, it doesn't get any. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=728.5s)]
*  It has to be bad. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=729.5s)]
*  It has to be bad media. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=730.5s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=731.5s)]
*  Everything's turned so negative. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=732.5s)]
*  And sometimes I even use it, you know, to like promote things. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=734.5s)]
*  I'll just go stir the pot a little bit whenever I got to promote and the media will bite on the hook. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=737.5s)]
*  Hey Tucker, I'll drink yours. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=742.5s)]
*  Would you mind? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=743.5s)]
*  Would you like one, Bob? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=744.5s)]
*  What's that? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=745.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=746.5s)]
*  Good boy? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=747.5s)]
*  Why do you call it good boy? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=748.5s)]
*  Because I'm the bad boy of golf. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=749.5s)]
*  So we thought we'd change my image and call it good boy. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=751.5s)]
*  By selling vodka? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=754.5s)]
*  Does that work? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=755.5s)]
*  You think I'm a bad boy? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=756.5s)]
*  It says good boy, but you drink enough of these, you'll become a bad boy. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=757.5s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=762.5s)]
*  Hey, look, and everybody's drinking water that says liquid death. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=763.5s)]
*  I know. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=766.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=767.5s)]
*  You kind of just went the other way with it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=768.5s)]
*  What's the most number of those you've consumed at once? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=769.5s)]
*  Oh, I can drink 40 of these in a day. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=772.5s)]
*  How many? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=774.5s)]
*  40 easily. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=775.5s)]
*  40? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=776.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=777.5s)]
*  I've sat with him when I drank three bottles of vodka. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=778.5s)]
*  Confirmed. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=781.5s)]
*  Back in the day it was like three bottles of Jack Daniels or Crown, but since I got cancer, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=782.5s)]
*  I went to vodka and went to the Clear Shit. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=786.5s)]
*  Just because healthier. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=788.5s)]
*  Just keeping it healthy. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=789.5s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=790.5s)]
*  I think there comes a point in every man's life you approach your age. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=792.5s)]
*  He had to dial it back just, you know, go to two packs. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=795.5s)]
*  I'm going from Crown to vodka. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=797.5s)]
*  Two packs a day in a bottle of vodka, I have cancer. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=798.5s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=801.5s)]
*  Do you feel a health improvement moving from the dark liquor to the light liquor? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=803.5s)]
*  No. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=807.5s)]
*  No. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=808.5s)]
*  I think doctors are lying about that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=809.5s)]
*  When they say no, drink a handle of vodka instead of the Jack, I don't think there's any improvement. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=811.5s)]
*  They say the brown's bad for your body, but hell for me. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=817.5s)]
*  It's bad for your soul. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=820.5s)]
*  What soul? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=822.5s)]
*  I got soul. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=824.5s)]
*  Makes you crazy. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=826.5s)]
*  I love it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=828.5s)]
*  No, whiskey does make you, ever since I got off of it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=829.5s)]
*  Tequila. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=832.5s)]
*  I can't drink that. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=833.5s)]
*  I can't drink that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=834.5s)]
*  I can't smell it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=835.5s)]
*  I've drank tequila three times. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=836.5s)]
*  I've been to jail three times. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=837.5s)]
*  I used to drink the warm in college to get a big thing of Long Island iced tea for the golf team. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=838.5s)]
*  Oh, I remember that. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=843.5s)]
*  I think drinking vodka is differently than I have witnessed than turning a handle of vodka up like this. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=844.5s)]
*  Having a vodka drink. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=853.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=854.5s)]
*  A little more management. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=855.5s)]
*  There's a difference. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=856.5s)]
*  You've been to jail three times? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=857.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=859.5s)]
*  For what? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=860.5s)]
*  Fighting. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=861.5s)]
*  It's usually for standing up for somebody, to be honest. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=862.5s)]
*  How many of those fights did you win? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=867.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=868.5s)]
*  I was drunk. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=869.5s)]
*  You didn't even score at that point? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=870.5s)]
*  Waffle House. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=871.5s)]
*  I remember the Waffle House. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=872.5s)]
*  Something in Mount Clemens where young. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=873.5s)]
*  What was the other one? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=874.5s)]
*  You actually got arrested at Waffle House? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=875.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=876.5s)]
*  It's a big story, good talker. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=877.5s)]
*  That was before it was cool to get arrested. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=879.5s)]
*  That was before everybody got arrested at Waffle House. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=880.5s)]
*  I was standing up for some girls. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=881.5s)]

*  I do too. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=884.5s)]
*  But you know what I did, and I think people should hear this, is what I've always tried [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=885.5s)]
*  to do is take a negative and turn it into a positive. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=888.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=891.5s)]
*  So that incident happened, and I had my reasoning. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=892.5s)]
*  It was just an old fashioned fight. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=894.5s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to go to jail. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=896.5s)]
*  I'm going to go to jail. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=897.5s)]
*  I'm going to go to jail. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=898.5s)]
*  I'm going to go to jail. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=899.5s)]
*  I'm going to go to jail. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=900.5s)]

*  I'm going to go to jail. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=903.5s)]
*  That incident happened, and I had my reasoning. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=904.5s)]
*  It was just a good old fashioned fight. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=906.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=908.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=909.5s)]
*  Nobody had guns. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=910.5s)]
*  There was windows dropped, and it was rather violent. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=911.5s)]
*  Things happened. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=914.5s)]
*  But it's crazy. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=915.5s)]
*  My record went number one. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=918.5s)]
*  I had one number one record in my career. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=921.5s)]
*  It was Rock and Roll Jesus, and the thing went number one the next day. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=923.5s)]
*  I'm like, they just keep rewarding me for what seems like bad behavior. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=926.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=931.5s)]
*  Defending the honor of a woman at Waffle House? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=933.5s)]
*  I'm not going to call that bad. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=935.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=936.5s)]
*  I went back to, it's a long story, but I went back to that Waffle House months later and [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=937.5s)]
*  had people come pay money to take a picture, sign autographs, and gave it to a local abuse [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=943.5s)]
*  shelter for women. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=949.5s)]
*  I was like, let's take this and do something positive out of it, which I've always tried [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=950.5s)]
*  to have that mindset. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=955.5s)]
*  Things happen. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=956.5s)]
*  People get wild, blah, blah, blah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=957.5s)]
*  They get a little out of hand. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=958.5s)]
*  I wish it was more like that. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=961.5s)]
*  Like, screw you. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=962.5s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=963.5s)]
*  Hey, sorry, man. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=964.5s)]
*  Have you seen the guy you fought? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=965.5s)]
*  Only in court. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=969.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=971.5s)]
*  He was not happy. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=972.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=974.5s)]
*  He was a rather large black gentleman. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=975.5s)]
*  It was me and my band members, and we're all like little skinny white kids. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=979.5s)]
*  He didn't come out well in that ordeal. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=984.5s)]
*  Oh, so he was humiliated. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=987.5s)]
*  Did you learn anything in prison? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=989.5s)]
*  It wasn't prison. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=994.5s)]
*  It's like jail. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=996.5s)]
*  No, but when you did the hard time. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=997.5s)]
*  They let us have our phones. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=999.5s)]
*  We're taking pictures in there. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1001.5s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1003.5s)]
*  What kind of jit does Waffle House have? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1005.5s)]
*  Trust me, I'm no hardened criminal from the mean streets of Romeo, Michigan being raised [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1009.5s)]
*  very middle to upper class. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1014.5s)]
*  Did you ever get arrested? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1016.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1020.5s)]
*  I wore the orange suit. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1021.5s)]
*  It was a great Hooters ad. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1023.5s)]
*  What happened? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1026.5s)]
*  It happened at Hooters. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1027.5s)]
*  No, it actually wasn't even my father. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1028.5s)]
*  Wait, so you got arrested at Waffle House and you got arrested at Hooters? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1029.5s)]
*  Because I didn't have a ride. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1032.5s)]
*  Fair? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1034.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1035.5s)]
*  And the manager was so cool. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1036.5s)]
*  He said, look, I'll put him on my motorcycle. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1038.5s)]
*  I'll take him back. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1040.5s)]
*  I was with a certain great country star. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1042.5s)]
*  We went on the road for three or four days. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1045.5s)]
*  We were writing songs and stuff. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1047.5s)]
*  And I had the 100% card. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1049.5s)]
*  So of course. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1051.5s)]
*  I had that card. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1052.5s)]
*  You got me those cards. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1053.5s)]
*  Wait, what's 100%? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1054.5s)]
*  It says on the back of it, if I remember Hooters, it's like, even though I make the big bucks, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1055.5s)]
*  I'm sticking Hooters with the tab. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1060.5s)]
*  I'm sticking Hooters with the tab except for drinks. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1062.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1064.5s)]
*  They wouldn't pay for your drinks, but all the food is free. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1065.5s)]
*  It's like free wings. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1067.5s)]
*  It's the best card on the planet because Hooters has the best food on the planet. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1068.5s)]
*  That's a tough sell. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1073.5s)]
*  You want it? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1076.5s)]
*  Well, if you want it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1077.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1078.5s)]
*  I've never been to Hooters. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1079.5s)]
*  You need one? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1080.5s)]
*  You've never been to Hooters? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1081.5s)]
*  Never. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1082.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1083.5s)]
*  Never. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1084.5s)]
*  What planet do you live in? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1085.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1086.5s)]
*  And I've never been arrested at Waffle House. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1087.5s)]
*  And I feel like I've led a pretty varied and interesting life. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1088.5s)]
*  But even though I make the big bucks, I'm sticking Hooters with 100% of the bill except [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1089.5s)]
*  for the tip. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1094.5s)]
*  Oh, except for the tip. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1095.5s)]
*  Dude, that's a good one. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1096.5s)]
*  Except for the tip. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1097.5s)]
*  Dude, that's almost perfect recall. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1098.5s)]
*  So that only works at HOA stores. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1100.1s)]
*  So like if you come to the Providence stores, which is 27 stores. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1101.86s)]
*  This is John Daly, Hooters spokesperson. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1104.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1107.5s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1108.5s)]
*  That's better than the African American Express card from African American Express, the black [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1111.5s)]
*  card. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=1118.1s)]

*  in an outdoor setting with friends. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2438.94s)]

*  My partner and I'm like, I was like, I bet you $100, you can't hit it past mine. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2477.5s)]
*  I probably went 20 yards. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2482.5s)]
*  So he gets his backswing, I take my driver and I throw it. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2483.5s)]
*  He smacks my driver, his ball went 10 feet. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2488.5s)]
*  I'm like, pay me motherfucker. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2490.5s)]
*  And then it turned into a shit show because I ran over clubs and... [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2493.1s)]
*  Somebody put sand in somebody's bag. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2496.1s)]

*  It's brutal. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2519.94s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2520.94s)]

*  The greatest thing. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2696.02s)]

*  No, no, no. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2706.02s)]
*  It wasn't Fox News. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2707.02s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2708.02s)]

*  Bitch. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2713.02s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2714.02s)]
*  I don't think it went down like that. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2715.02s)]
*  I was in my hockey time. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2717.02s)]
*  I'm a granddaughter. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2718.02s)]
*  I got canceled from a parade. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2719.02s)]
*  I did get canceled once from a parade, but I didn't because I got asked to do six other [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2720.02s)]
*  shows. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2723.02s)]
*  I got canceled from a parade. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2724.02s)]
*  I got canceled from a parade. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2725.02s)]
*  I got canceled from a parade. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2726.02s)]
*  I got canceled from a parade. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2727.02s)]
*  I got canceled from a parade. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2728.02s)]
*  I got canceled from a parade, I got canceled from a parade. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2730.02s)]
*  So I got a call for a parade, and I was like, this lady asked to do six other parades and [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2731.02s)]
*  I promised my granddaughter. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2733.02s)]
*  She was excited to be in a parade. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2735.02s)]
*  That's why I was going to do it. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2737.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2738.02s)]
*  So I'm like, we'll find a parade, honey. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2739.02s)]
*  We found one, the second, and the other. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2741.02s)]
*  So effectively it didn't cancel me. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2743.02s)]
*  Because I was turning down parades at that point. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2745.02s)]
*  But why'd they cancel you? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2747.02s)]
*  Because I called Joy Behar a bitch. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2748.02s)]
*  That's fair though. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2750.02s)]
*  It's totally fair. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2751.02s)]
*  When you're in this world, when you're a public figure or whatever, that's okay to call somebody [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2754.02s)]
*  I don't think there's a single person of 350 million in this country who would testify under oath that joy Behar is not a bitch [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2758.02s)]
*  No, I think she actually said I am a bitch. Of course. She is she would say that that's exactly right [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2764.1s)]
*  You think if you're gonna interview one of the most legendary rock stars that ever lived you get some information on him [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2768.54s)]
*  But I'm calling the race joy Behar be exempt from criticism [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2774.7s)]
*  Like she can call you a racist, but you can't point out the obvious truth that she's a bitch [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2778.02s)]
*  No, I can't I'm awesome. Well, I know you are that's what I did. So she called you a racist [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2782.86s)]
*  I don't know what she called me. She said something about me going to the White House with us [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2787.88s)]
*  They're your tent nugent. They're like this was a disgrace or some shit whatever she said and I'll just like poor Steve Doocy [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2791.98s)]
*  He's like I got my granddaughter my arms. I'm like, I don't mean to curse on your show or whatever [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2799.1s)]

*  exactly, uh [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2822.34s)]
*  But also if you can't point out the obvious just right in your face truth that joy Behar is a bitch [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vI-p77LfM&t=2824.2200000000003s)]
