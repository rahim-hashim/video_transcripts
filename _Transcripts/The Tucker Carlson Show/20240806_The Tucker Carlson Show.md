# Patrick Feeney Doomsday Prepping and What Rural Americans Really Think about Kamala Harris
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4)
*  Who's the president right now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=0.0s)]
*  Do you have any clue? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2.2600000000000002s)]
*  What do you, you got brain damage? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4.78s)]
*  Who's the president? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5.9s)]
*  Simple question. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=6.74s)]
*  Like when they're, when doctors are trying to assess [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  whether you had a stroke or not, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=9.46s)]
*  they say who's the president? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=11.3s)]
*  I think you'd probably get the same answer [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  out of anybody. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=14.3s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=15.14s)]
*  I think Obama is the president myself. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=15.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  I really do. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  He took quite a while to endorse the camel toe, didn't he? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=19.56s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=24.62s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=25.46s)]
*  I think Joe Biden put the fucks to him on that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=26.28s)]
*  I didn't think they, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=28.36s)]
*  I don't think they wanted her. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=30.64s)]
*  When you say, just really don't live in the region, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=32.56s)]
*  when you say put the fucks to him, what does that mean? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=35.32s)]
*  He was like giving them the middle finger. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=39.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=40.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=40.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=41.68s)]
*  She is not qualified to do anything in my, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't hire her for a kindergarten art teacher. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=64.58s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=67.66s)]
*  I don't think anyone would. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=69.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, how did she, that's another thing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=70.38s)]
*  I mean, I know how she got in because DEI or DIE [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=72.42s)]
*  or whatever you want to call it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=76.5s)]
*  But yeah, we got to get rid of those laws. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=77.46s)]
*  Which laws? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=81.17999999999999s)]
*  The D, I don't know if they're laws. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=82.02s)]
*  Are any of these things laws that these people are doing? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=83.78s)]
*  Do you even know? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=85.82s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=86.66s)]
*  I don't think they're laws. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  I just think they've spoken assumptions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=88.32s)]
*  I don't think you're getting a job at JP Morgan [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=91.74s)]
*  if that's your question. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=93.52s)]
*  Right, but I don't think that these things [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=94.66s)]
*  that people are doing are laws. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=98.06s)]
*  I don't think they have to hire somebody [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=99.46s)]
*  because they're of color, a woman or, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=101.05999999999999s)]
*  there's no law saying you have to have a, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=106.38s)]
*  you have to have 39% of your employees have to be of color. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  There's no law, is there? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=112.86s)]
*  I think the Justice Department will sue you if you don't. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Will they? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=117.22s)]
*  Yep, because too many white men is bad. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=118.06s)]
*  They might like write a constitution [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=121.02s)]
*  or build a functional country or something. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=122.94s)]
*  Yeah, there are laws on the books now [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=124.33999999999999s)]
*  that say you have to do that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  No, there are regulations so far. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=127.7s)]
*  They can sue you then? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=129.98s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=130.98s)]
*  They would just sue you? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=131.82s)]
*  Yeah, because it's prima facie discrimination. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  Like there's no black and white law saying [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=133.48s)]
*  you have to have so many people of certain color [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=135.06s)]
*  or race or gender working for you, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=139.22s)]
*  I don't think passed by the Congress. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=141.7s)]
*  Right, so if you had a company of 50. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=143.22s)]
*  Because that itself would violate civil rights law. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=144.62s)]
*  You can't discriminate on the basis of race, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=146.26s)]
*  That is a law in the United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=148.36s)]
*  So if I had an asphalt company and I had 50 employees, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=149.7s)]
*  then I didn't hire somebody because, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=153.76s)]
*  so a guy fills out an application, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  I don't hire him because he's got four OUIs [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=161.32s)]
*  and he doesn't have a dump truck license, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=164.6s)]
*  but he happens to be of color. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Can he sue the asphalt company? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  And say, well, he didn't hire me. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, it happens all the time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=171.7s)]
*  Right, and do they win? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=173.16s)]
*  Absolutely they win. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=174.68s)]
*  Wow, so there is no law saying so. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=175.68s)]
*  I don't know about the dump truck license or the four OUIs, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=178.12s)]
*  though I think probably yes, they'd win. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  But certainly it's very, very common for people [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  who scored lower on the test that gauges [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=186.68s)]
*  whether you can do the job or not. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=189.96s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=191.4s)]
*  To not get the job. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=192.24s)]
*  Oh, absolutely, and win, no, absolutely. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  So they don't go by the test? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  No, they haven't tested. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=197.44000000000003s)]
*  Okay, we had a bunch of cones set up [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  and we had two dump trucks [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=201.44000000000003s)]
*  and these guys did the best on their test. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=202.68s)]
*  Yeah, but what color are they? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  The cones? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the cones, the cones are orange. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=208.88000000000002s)]
*  I know that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=211.28000000000003s)]
*  So you've been saying for a long time [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=213.4s)]
*  that things are gonna fall apart. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  You have been. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=219.28s)]
*  I can't wait. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=220.12s)]
*  Like for over a decade you always say, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=220.96s)]
*  it's coming and when it does, these people are fucked. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=223.52s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=226.4s)]
*  It does seem like a little less crazy prediction right now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=227.72000000000003s)]
*  Right, I mean, they are falling apart. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=230.84s)]
*  If you look at the talk about looting, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=233.16000000000003s)]
*  what happens is the biggest thing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  with losing the energy grid, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=238.4s)]
*  all the millions of scenarios that can happen. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=240.84s)]
*  It's already happening. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=243.56s)]
*  California. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=244.4s)]
*  Well, California, exactly right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=245.24s)]
*  So what do you think about buying big plastic bins [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=247.0s)]
*  of freeze dried food? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you should have, that's a short term solution. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=253.44s)]
*  It's not gonna get you through the Great Depression. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=255.8s)]
*  Yeah, no it's not. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=259.68s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=260.52s)]
*  It's not gonna get you through post-Civil War [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=261.36s)]
*  down South Living. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=266.48s)]
*  It's gonna get you through two weeks without power at most. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=269.48s)]
*  Maybe a year if you get a whole stockpile of it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  No, you gotta have a mindset of, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=275.76s)]
*  can I live, am I gonna be able to live [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=280.0s)]
*  like I have to live when that time comes? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=283.56s)]
*  Like to simplify your life. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=287.44s)]
*  Am I gonna be, say you've got a daughter [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=288.84s)]

*  to live in New York City. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=295.2s)]
*  It's gonna be burned down and looted, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  which it almost is now. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=297.76s)]
*  Okay, is she gonna be ready to come to New Jersey or Maine [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=300.44s)]
*  or where New Jersey is probably still too close [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  in that situation, I don't know. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  But Pennsylvania, Maine to live, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=310.0s)]
*  is she gonna be able to say, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=313.68s)]
*  okay, this has happened with the Great, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  we'll just use the Great Depression for a baseline. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  Great Depression has happened. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=319.56s)]
*  Everybody's jumping out of the buildings in New York City. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  All right, we're gonna hang out in Maine for 20 years [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=323.92s)]
*  and get our life back together. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=325.88s)]
*  Is your family ready for that? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=328.48s)]
*  Are your close ones, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=329.92s)]
*  are everybody you're close to ready for that? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=331.76s)]
*  No. Whether they're trained or not, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  the training doesn't matter. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  It's just in their mind. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=338.04s)]
*  You gotta be ready for that stuff. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=339.56s)]
*  You gotta always have that, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=341.32s)]
*  live like you live. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=342.6s)]
*  I live very, very modern. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=343.44s)]
*  Do everything modern. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  Everything I got is power. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=347.24s)]
*  Everything I got, but in the back of my brain, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=348.44s)]
*  I'm like, I might have to cut my firewood by hand [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  because I'm not gonna be able to get any gas someday. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=353.6s)]
*  Well, the fact that you use firewood in the first place [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  suggests you're not totally modern. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=358.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=359.52s)]
*  So you burn firewood? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=360.36s)]
*  Yeah, a lot. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=361.32s)]
*  Probably eight cords a year. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=362.56s)]
*  How much is eight cords? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=363.8s)]
*  A wheeler load, a truck load. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=365.16s)]
*  When you see the big truck going down the road, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=367.76s)]
*  that's about eight cord. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=369.24s)]
*  I'm just saying this for, I know how much that is. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=370.6s)]
*  So you burn it for heat. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=373.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=374.48s)]
*  And my father burns wood. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=375.32s)]
*  I have an oil furnace back up. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=376.88s)]
*  I bought a hundred gallons of oil [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=381.44s)]
*  when I moved into my house, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=384.2s)]
*  which was 10 years ago. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=386.2s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  And I still, I probably burn 10 of the hundred gallons. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=389.44s)]
*  So- I just turn the furnace on every year [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=392.88s)]
*  to make sure it works. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=394.36s)]
*  That's about it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=395.2s)]
*  So you burn your house on your farm. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=396.03999999999996s)]
*  It's not tiny, but it's not huge. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=400.08s)]
*  And you burn eight cords of wood. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  What does it take to prepare that wood? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=405.44s)]
*  I gotta, if I buy it tree length, which I have before, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=410.4s)]
*  so the truck comes, it drops it off tree length. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=414.24s)]
*  I would say with the machinery that I have, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=416.48s)]
*  which is a hydraulic splitter and a dump trailer [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=420.36s)]
*  and a conveyor and a chainsaw and a tractor [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=423.16s)]
*  and all those stuff every farm has, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=425.24s)]
*  I'd say a week, a week. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=428.12s)]
*  If I don't do it straight, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=430.0s)]
*  I'd do a couple hours after supper type stuff. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  But yeah, it would be a week. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  If I took a week off, I could get my firewood done. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=435.72s)]
*  If two weeks, I could do mine and my father's together. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=438.24s)]
*  If I have to cut the tree down [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=440.76s)]
*  and drag it out of the woods, then it's probably two weeks. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=442.24s)]
*  So what is that just for people [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=445.0s)]
*  who don't cut their own firewood, eight cords of wood? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=446.72s)]
*  How many cords does your dad- [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=449.72s)]
*  About 35 trees is eight cords. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=450.56s)]
*  And how many cords does your dad burn a wood? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=452.64s)]
*  Probably six, six to eight. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=454.48s)]
*  We'll just call it eight. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=455.76s)]
*  We each burn a load a year. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=456.76s)]
*  Okay, so 16 cords of wood. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=458.0s)]
*  Let's say you have it dropped off in front of your house [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  with a truck and it's just tree length, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=464.44s)]
*  no branches, but tree length. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=467.2s)]
*  What do you have to do to get it ready? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=469.52s)]
*  You gotta cut it to six, well, I cut mine two foot 20 inches, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=471.32s)]
*  but 16 inches most people, depends on your stove. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=475.92s)]
*  You have to, so you, I pick it up with the tractor. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  I cut it with a chainsaw. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=481.96s)]
*  I have a pretty good efficient system. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=483.24s)]
*  So you gotta cut it to length. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=487.04s)]
*  You gotta split it to size so it dries. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  If it's small stuff, you don't have to split it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=491.71999999999997s)]
*  Round wood is the best. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=493.36s)]
*  Unsplit wood, the more, every time you split it, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=496.08s)]
*  they say you lose 10% of the efficiency out of it [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=498.56s)]
*  because you've made it smaller. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=501.24s)]
*  A big chunk of wood burns really efficiently. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=502.52s)]
*  So you always leave it big. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=505.0s)]
*  And I always split it as I need it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=506.92s)]
*  I'll break it down to where I can handle it, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=509.16s)]
*  but I don't break it down really small to start with. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=512.28s)]
*  And then when you're in the cellar, then you can, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=516.6s)]
*  okay, I need some small stuff. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=519.76s)]
*  You just split up what you need. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=520.92s)]
*  Then you don't have a whole pile of small stuff [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=522.0s)]
*  that burns real fast. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=523.8s)]
*  And then you gotta stack it and dry it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=525.32s)]
*  That's the time consuming thing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=526.96s)]
*  You can't burn it green. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=529.16s)]
*  It takes about a year to dry wood. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=530.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=532.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  So you have, I guess, 32 cords of wood sitting out. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=533.8s)]
*  Yep, I do. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=537.76s)]
*  I got mine. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=538.5999999999999s)]
*  I got next year's is all done. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=539.76s)]
*  My father is, we're working on his, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=542.4s)]
*  he's got next year's all, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=544.7199999999999s)]
*  we had his next year all done this winter. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=546.28s)]
*  And I'm doing his year after that right now. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=548.88s)]
*  And then this winter I'll do my next year's. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=553.76s)]
*  I can actually dry it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=555.64s)]
*  If I had it done in the winter, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  it will be ready in the fall. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=558.04s)]
*  So when I say a year, it's like a season. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=559.12s)]
*  Dries pretty fast at my house and I stack it so it dries. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=562.12s)]
*  So that's with machines. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=565.24s)]
*  So the- [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=566.44s)]
*  If you were doing it by hand, I can't imagine. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=567.72s)]
*  Like I see the, you see the pictures of the old timers [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=569.48s)]
*  out there with the cross cut saw in the mall [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=571.48s)]
*  and they were probably those old farmhouses. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=573.52s)]
*  I've heard 10, 12 cords in winter. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=575.88s)]
*  Can you imagine doing that all by hand? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=577.84s)]
*  Because they were heating with fireplaces. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=579.08s)]
*  I mean, before woods, no, really you're heating- [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=580.84s)]
*  An open pit, yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=582.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=583.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=584.76s)]
*  Can you imagine cutting that all by hand? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=585.6s)]
*  So how would you cut 10 cords with no gasoline or diesel? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=587.68s)]
*  You'd have to get a sharp saw and just go to it the old way. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=590.8s)]
*  You know, you'd have to have more kids. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  That is kind of the answer. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=597.3599999999999s)]
*  Start breeding. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=598.56s)]
*  So could you, I mean, how long do you think [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=601.2399999999999s)]
*  that would take you? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=603.56s)]
*  Oh, that would take, that would just be an, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=604.52s)]
*  I think it would just be an ongoing thing. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=606.68s)]
*  I think like every day after supper, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=608.3599999999999s)]
*  you would just go out for an hour and cut, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=610.16s)]
*  you know, maybe a day's worth of wood, not over, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  and you wouldn't want to overwhelm yourself. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=617.08s)]
*  You know, can you, you know, just every, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=619.64s)]
*  that's, if you don't have machinery, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=621.72s)]
*  that's kind of how you do every kind of gardening chore [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=623.6s)]
*  or firewood chore. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=627.08s)]
*  You just kind of try not to overwhelm yourself [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=627.96s)]
*  and make it a chore. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=630.84s)]
*  So of all the things, just think of if you're driving home [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=632.0s)]
*  and you see a tree on the side of the road [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  that, you know, is free for the taking, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=637.2800000000001s)]
*  it fell down or whatever, and you just stopped and grabbed it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=639.48s)]
*  If you did that every day in your travels, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=642.32s)]
*  you'd probably have enough firewood. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=644.9200000000001s)]
*  If you just stopped and saw every tree [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  on the side of the road and cut it up, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=649.1600000000001s)]
*  threw it in the back of your truck, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=650.76s)]
*  and that's what we used to do in the old days. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=652.2s)]
*  We didn't drive by a tree. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=654.0s)]
*  You know, we would stop and cut it up [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=656.88s)]
*  and throw it in the truck. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=658.0400000000001s)]
*  Did you get paid by the town for cleaning up the roads? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=658.88s)]
*  No. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=661.48s)]
*  So of all the things that worry you, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=663.76s)]
*  power grid going down is probably gonna be [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=665.48s)]
*  at the bottom, right? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=667.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, not big. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  Other than food storage, my freezer, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=669.36s)]
*  you know, I think things would have to really get bad [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=674.88s)]
*  to not be able to get any gas, gasoline, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=677.32s)]
*  and diesel at the stores. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=679.88s)]
*  I don't know, you know, it depends on how bad things got. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=681.2s)]
*  If it was like a war situation, it would be bad. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=685.24s)]
*  I mean, it's- Right, if the refinery shut down. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=687.64s)]
*  Yeah, if the refinery shut down and how much, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=689.12s)]
*  you know, you're not gonna waste that gas mowing your lawn [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=693.6s)]
*  when you need to run a generator, you know, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=699.36s)]
*  so your food, you're not gonna drive, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=702.0s)]
*  you're not gonna just drive for the sake of driving [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=705.04s)]
*  somewhere if you've got to have that gas to live off. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=707.32s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know how bad it's gonna get, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=709.44s)]
*  but you can store food without power. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=711.08s)]
*  You can can the meat like they did. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=713.28s)]
*  You can butcher, you know, get all your neighbors together. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=715.8s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna butcher a cow today, you know? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=719.68s)]
*  So you cut it up accordingly. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=723.16s)]
*  So that's how they did it in the old day [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=724.6s)]
*  before refrigeration, the butcher butchered things [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=726.28s)]
*  accordingly so the meat would get used up fast enough. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=728.76s)]
*  So, and small animals, small animals were developed [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=732.48s)]
*  in the olden days we'll call them for a lot of times [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=736.04s)]
*  for refrigeration purposes. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=740.68s)]
*  If you're one family out in the middle of the, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=742.84s)]
*  you know, plains living, you're not gonna butcher a cow [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=746.04s)]
*  in the middle of July. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=748.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=749.64s)]
*  You know, you're gonna butcher a sheep that you can eat. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=750.48s)]
*  Exactly, fast enough. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=753.24s)]
*  Before it spoils. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=754.08s)]
*  Before it spoils, or you're gonna can it, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=754.92s)]
*  but canned meat's not my favorite thing. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=757.12s)]
*  Yeah, you get botulism. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=759.72s)]
*  Which we now think of as like the core ingredient in Botox, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=761.96s)]
*  but it's also a- [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=764.88s)]
*  I think people's, just, I wouldn't say prepping would be [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=765.72s)]
*  a more of a, just a way to start thinking about things. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=770.48s)]
*  Like, is your, you know, like I said, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=776.0s)]
*  is your family ready? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=777.72s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to imagine it if you've been a beneficiary [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=781.0s)]
*  of 100 years of modernity and ease and wealth and- [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=785.4000000000001s)]
*  Right, we've all had an easy life. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=788.1600000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=789.2s)]
*  I've had a super easy life as far as that kind of stuff goes. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=790.04s)]
*  I mean, we all work hard and do things, but. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  So what do you store now? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=795.48s)]
*  And I should say for the- [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=798.28s)]
*  I didn't even introduce you, this is Patrick Feeney, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=799.24s)]
*  lives in Maine, has had every kind of job imaginable, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=801.5999999999999s)]
*  and lives basically, from my perspective, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=805.56s)]
*  you live pretty close to off-grid, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=808.4s)]
*  like you produce most of your food at home on your farm. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=809.5999999999999s)]
*  Animals, you've got a pretty amazing grow operation. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=812.92s)]
*  You know, how many different fruits, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=817.92s)]
*  how many different vegetables do you grow? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=820.28s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=821.56s)]
*  That's, I'm more of a McDonald's french fry type of guy, but. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=822.4s)]
*  Your wife. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=827.64s)]
*  My wife grows, yeah, everything you can imagine. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=828.56s)]
*  Lettuce, beets, I like corn on the cob. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=833.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, I like all the potatoes. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=835.8399999999999s)]
*  I love potatoes. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, any vegetable you can think of, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  salad greens, carrots, greenhouse. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=840.3199999999999s)]
*  But more than enough to live. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=843.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, she feeds. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=846.12s)]
*  She supplies food to three restaurants in town, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=847.64s)]
*  and sells to 20 different people. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=850.84s)]
*  So she supplies plenty. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=853.28s)]
*  So you're good to go with food. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=854.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, we're good to, and I would say storage [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=855.8000000000001s)]
*  would not be a, I would say, food's almost, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  storage is, you gotta think that short term with any food. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=861.32s)]
*  You get your long term storage, the buckets that you buy, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=866.28s)]
*  yeah, that's, I don't know. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=869.0s)]
*  Are those really gonna be good in 100 years? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=871.44s)]
*  You wonder. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=873.96s)]
*  You know, have you ever eaten a 30 year old MRE? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  I have, it's not. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=877.48s)]
*  Why are you eating 30 year old MRE? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=879.36s)]
*  Just to try it, I found one a couple years ago [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=880.76s)]
*  that I had left over from the army. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=883.2800000000001s)]
*  Wasn't that? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=885.0s)]
*  It wasn't that good. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=885.84s)]
*  I never really liked them in the army, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=886.6800000000001s)]
*  and I really don't like them now. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=887.76s)]
*  30 years from now, the same one. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=889.64s)]
*  So what do you stockpile? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  Meat in the freezer. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=895.0400000000001s)]
*  Now that's a catch, that could bite me in the ass [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=896.5200000000001s)]
*  because of the electrical grid. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=898.9200000000001s)]
*  Freezer doesn't use much juice, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=901.72s)]
*  so you could have your little thousand watt Honda generator, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=903.0s)]
*  fire it up for an hour a day, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=906.48s)]
*  plug your freezer in and get it cold. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=908.5200000000001s)]
*  You know, you could do that for a while. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=911.1600000000001s)]
*  What kind of meat do you store? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=912.84s)]
*  Mostly deer and moose. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=914.7600000000001s)]
*  And if we haven't had, we got a pig, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=916.0400000000001s)]
*  we got two pigs we just bought today. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=918.84s)]
*  They're gonna raise them, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=921.5600000000001s)]
*  but boy, they look awful tasty that size right there. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=923.48s)]
*  I might just have a little pig party. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=925.48s)]
*  Well, you texted me a picture and said they were so cute. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=929.2800000000001s)]
*  You already think about eating them? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=930.96s)]
*  Yeah, they look, ooh, they're very tasty. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=931.8800000000001s)]
*  Pig roast is very, very fun. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=934.52s)]
*  No, it just, whatever, moose deer, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=936.84s)]
*  like I shot, I think I shot two deer, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=938.68s)]
*  three deer last year. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=941.0s)]
*  So that takes up some space. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=942.64s)]
*  Not a lot of meat on a deer, you know? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=943.72s)]
*  You really have to shoot a couple every year [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=945.56s)]
*  to make a difference unless you get a really big one. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=947.56s)]
*  Moose, a lot of, you know, might get the moose last year. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=950.16s)]
*  So that was, we still get the moose meat. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=952.52s)]
*  What do you think of it? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=956.0s)]
*  I love moose meat. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=956.96s)]
*  That was a good moose. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=957.8s)]
*  I've had good moose, I've had bad moose. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=958.62s)]
*  That was a good one. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=960.04s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=960.88s)]
*  Just the gaminess and the, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=961.78s)]
*  you got, you got to, when you kill something, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=963.36s)]
*  you really got to get it. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=966.04s)]
*  Moose season can be warm. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=967.86s)]
*  It was warm that day. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=970.0600000000001s)]
*  Wasn't too bad, but it was probably 60 degrees. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=971.4s)]
*  You got to hustle, get it on ice. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=973.64s)]
*  You know, we drugged it right on the trailer [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=976.44s)]
*  and got it right to the butcher shop, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=978.4s)]
*  right to the guy's house with the freezer. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=980.7s)]
*  Hung it in the freezer and put it on ice [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=983.6s)]
*  when we were driving. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=985.84s)]
*  You know, the whole process was fast. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=986.76s)]
*  And that makes a huge difference with game. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=988.4s)]
*  Did you, but you dressed it in the field. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=990.08s)]
*  Dressed it in the field. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=991.76s)]
*  We shot it like 830. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=993.36s)]
*  And we were back at my parents' house by 11. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=996.76s)]
*  After that, we tagged it, shot it, dragged it out, tagged it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1002.66s)]
*  My parents' house at 11, Mike and I took off in New Hampshire [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1007.52s)]
*  to our friend Doug with the cooler [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1010.84s)]
*  and he's got a meat cutting business. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1015.0s)]
*  So we get, we were at his house by like probably three [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1016.6s)]
*  in the afternoon. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1019.2s)]
*  How much of the dressing did you use a chainsaw for? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1020.8s)]
*  Didn't have to, we were close to the truck. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1025.48s)]
*  We then drove the four wheeler right to the moose. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1027.68s)]
*  So we didn't have to cut the legs off or any of that stuff. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1030.84s)]
*  Just cut up the middle. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1033.44s)]
*  I use the saw for the, I use a sawzall actually. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1035.08s)]
*  Works good too. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1037.6399999999999s)]
*  Cut the chest open with a sawzall. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1038.68s)]
*  How much meat do you get out of that moose? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1041.8s)]
*  You get 400 pounds of meat, I think, I believe. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1044.04s)]
*  Out of a 600, I think I might have 700 pound moose. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1048.2s)]
*  That was a big moose. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1052.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, deer are about, 200 pound deer will get you, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1053.8s)]
*  I would mainly have 200 pound deer. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1057.56s)]
*  So I say 150 pound deer would be average. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1060.3s)]
*  Would be 50 pounds of meat out of 150 pound deer. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1063.52s)]
*  I'm just saying that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1068.3400000000001s)]
*  Maybe 75 pounds, but a lot of bone. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1070.48s)]
*  Like a cow, all bone and for, and on head. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1074.6000000000001s)]
*  So you got meat in your cooler. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1079.04s)]
*  You have any bear in your cooler? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1081.88s)]
*  Not right now. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1084.78s)]
*  I'm not a huge fan of bear meat. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1086.28s)]
*  I did shoot one a couple of years ago, a nice small one. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1087.8s)]
*  And it was very good eating. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1090.04s)]
*  That was another, I shot that with snow on the ground. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1091.28s)]
*  So I cooled it off fast. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1094.0800000000002s)]
*  Bear meat spoils fast. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1095.26s)]
*  They shoot bear in like what, August? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1096.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1098.44s)]
*  You see that. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1099.28s)]
*  Because it's so greasy. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1100.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it is very like, when you shoot something in August, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1100.94s)]
*  you gotta be fast. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1103.44s)]
*  I don't like watching the hunting shows [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1104.56s)]
*  where they go get the deer the next morning. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1106.08s)]
*  You know, you shoot the deer and they're in like Texas [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1109.32s)]
*  or I don't know those places, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1111.72s)]
*  but they're in like Texas and they shoot the deer. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1113.1999999999998s)]
*  Oh, we'll go look for it in the morning. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1115.08s)]
*  What happens if you leave? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1117.1999999999998s)]
*  You see that if you watch the camera footage enough, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1118.6799999999998s)]
*  the coyotes have chewed the ass off the deer. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1121.1799999999998s)]
*  You know? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1123.28s)]
*  And it can't be any good. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1124.84s)]
*  I've shot deer in like cold weather [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1126.26s)]
*  and found them the next day [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1128.48s)]
*  and they're already starting to stink. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1129.3999999999999s)]
*  You know? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1130.84s)]
*  Do you eat it anyway? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1131.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there's parts of it that are still good, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1132.58s)]
*  but anything next to the belly, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1134.32s)]
*  and if it ran away, it was probably gut shot anyway [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1136.56s)]
*  or not a good shot. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1138.56s)]
*  So it's all full of bile and stuff. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1139.56s)]
*  You wanna have a nice clean shot if you can. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1142.6399999999999s)]
*  I think you owe it to any animal. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1145.24s)]
*  You know, you try your best. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1146.6s)]
*  Things happen. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1148.96s)]
*  Of course you do. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1149.8s)]
*  You know? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1150.62s)]
*  But you don't wanna just start wailing away at something [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1151.46s)]
*  thinking you're gonna hit it in the ass or something. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1154.8799999999999s)]
*  I got shot a hog. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1156.32s)]
*  It was the last time I went hog hunting. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1157.2s)]
*  I felt so bad about it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1158.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1159.48s)]
*  I mean, you didn't do purposely do it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1160.3s)]
*  It just, you know, you flinch and things happen. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1161.32s)]
*  But yeah, you wanna, you know, do the best you can always. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1164.04s)]

*  Private businesses do it, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1177.12s)]

*  Internet traffic, including yours, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1182.56s)]

*  It's bought and sold and it's used to manipulate [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1185.92s)]
*  what you think, what you buy, and yes, even how you vote. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1188.32s)]
*  It's a big deal and it's a huge market. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1192.32s)]
*  Your internet provider can see every single website [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1194.72s)]

*  It should be put out of business, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1219.04s)]
*  these companies, immediately. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1220.96s)]

*  cannot see our browsing history. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1239.34s)]
*  Simply put, we've got nothing to sell [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1241.36s)]
*  because they don't have anything on us. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1243.4s)]

*  and power-hungry government actors have tried and succeeded [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1262.3600000000001s)]

*  ExpressVPN hides your IP address. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1276.88s)]
*  That's a number that reveals your actual identity [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1280.8s)]
*  on the internet. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1283.3999999999999s)]
*  It's unique. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1284.44s)]
*  Because we hide our IP address with ExpressVPN, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1285.72s)]
*  data brokers can't use it to build a profile on us [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1289.28s)]
*  to sell off to marketers or other governments [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1292.36s)]

*  That happens, too. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1296.0s)]
*  By the way, hiding your IP address is really useful [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1297.72s)]
*  when you want to appear to be somewhere you're not, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1300.9199999999998s)]
*  and that's your prerogative, by the way. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1302.6s)]
*  We used it in Moscow to get our reporting out of the country. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1304.2s)]
*  We've used it around the world. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1308.0s)]
*  We always use it. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1309.16s)]
*  You could also use it to access geo-restricted content [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1311.0s)]
*  from anywhere. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1313.92s)]

*  Bear meat, I just cook that like steak. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1372.3600000000001s)]
*  I cut those up into steaks. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1374.28s)]
*  I'm kind of a throw it in the fry pan type of cooker. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1376.2s)]
*  I'm not much on recipes. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1379.32s)]
*  I just like my, I like a little spices on my meat, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1381.4s)]
*  cook it on the grill. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1383.8s)]
*  I like a roast. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1385.16s)]
*  I love a crock pot, stew. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1386.0s)]
*  You can take bad cuts of meat and throw it in the crock pot [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1389.16s)]
*  and it will. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1391.2s)]
*  You can put anything in the crock pot. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1392.28s)]
*  Yeah, you can put anything in the crock pot [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1393.1200000000001s)]
*  and it tastes good. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1395.28s)]
*  So those are very basic. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1396.1200000000001s)]
*  But the idea that if you have a 308, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1398.4s)]
*  you've got enough nutrition, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1402.4s)]
*  could you hunt your way out of famine? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1404.88s)]
*  I've heard that the old wood logger guys [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1407.24s)]
*  in the logging camps in Maine, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1410.0s)]
*  would it be scurvy you would get without enough? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1413.56s)]
*  They ate all deer and moose meat [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1416.4s)]
*  and they were getting sick, lack of vitamin C. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1418.56s)]
*  But are there enough mammals in the woods to support? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1422.1599999999999s)]
*  Right now, I think that the end of the, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1425.48s)]
*  and I believe, I forget who was talking about this. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1427.6799999999998s)]
*  Might've been on one of your shows, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1432.0s)]
*  but okay, when that might've been Ted Nugent. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1433.28s)]
*  Okay, when the shit hits the fan, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1438.3999999999999s)]
*  how long are they gonna be? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1440.3999999999999s)]
*  There's not, in areas like we, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1441.6399999999999s)]
*  we're pretty rural here, but we're not that rural. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1443.44s)]
*  You can drive, there's a road everywhere. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1445.8s)]
*  We're not like Northern Maine. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1449.1599999999999s)]
*  There's not gonna be any deer really fast. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1450.08s)]
*  The woods around here aren't that big [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1452.9599999999998s)]
*  in this particular area. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1454.8s)]
*  These deer are gonna be gone fast. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1456.4799999999998s)]
*  It's mountainous and it's a five mile hike to the next road, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1460.4799999999998s)]
*  but five miles isn't that far. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1463.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, the game is gonna go fast. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1466.32s)]
*  It's gonna be during the depression, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1468.56s)]
*  the game went fast early night. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1470.84s)]
*  In the 30s, I mean. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1474.9199999999998s)]
*  My father said when he was a kid, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1476.04s)]
*  that would have been the 50s. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1477.44s)]
*  If somebody saw a deer where he grew up in Southern Maine, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1478.8s)]
*  it was in the paper. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1481.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, it was just, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1483.3600000000001s)]
*  if one popped out, it got shot. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1486.2s)]
*  And I think that's gonna happen if things get bad. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1488.76s)]
*  There's enough people that know you're gonna, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1492.04s)]
*  you're not gonna use self-preservation. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1493.52s)]
*  No matter how messed up your life is or what's going on, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1496.28s)]

*  and a dog steps out in front of you, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1501.32s)]
*  as much as you might like dogs, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1503.44s)]
*  if your family's dying, guess what? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1504.88s)]
*  Yeah, dogs too. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1506.7600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't do it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1508.16s)]
*  No way I would do it. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1510.72s)]
*  I would probably die before I ate a dog, but. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1511.6000000000001s)]
*  I would too. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1513.5600000000002s)]

*  I mean, people get really. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1516.4s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1517.92s)]
*  I think that's something more to think about. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1518.7600000000002s)]
*  Is it ever gonna get that bad? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1520.72s)]

*  I don't think there's too many cultures [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1533.32s)]

*  and taking over, you know what I mean? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1539.84s)]
*  Well, certainly the culture you grew up in [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1543.72s)]

*  No, I don't know if there are places in the world [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1545.8s)]

*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1548.76s)]
*  I mean, maybe the Middle East and that type of. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1549.6s)]
*  Africa. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1551.24s)]
*  Africa, yeah. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1552.08s)]

*  I can't imagine it would ever get that way here. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1555.76s)]

*  If I had five gallons of gas, he might bash me. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1575.2s)]

*  It's hard to, I mean, I use so much of it. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1579.8799999999999s)]
*  I filled up cans the other day, I filled up my cans, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1582.96s)]
*  I filled up your cans and man, that doesn't last long. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1585.44s)]
*  So, could you stockpile gas? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1589.92s)]
*  I think it would evaporate. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1592.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1593.56s)]
*  You know, you could do underground tank would be the best. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1594.4s)]
*  You gotta keep the ethanol, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1596.08s)]
*  you'd have to buy non-ethanol gas and stuff [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1597.64s)]
*  you can add to the gas to keep it from spoiling. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1600.0s)]
*  Diesel fuel spoils, it gets mold in it. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1602.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1604.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, you'd have to, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1605.56s)]
*  yeah, you could probably do it for a couple of years, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1607.24s)]
*  like maybe five years. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1608.96s)]
*  But why wouldn't you want ethanol in your gas [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1610.6s)]
*  when it helps the environment? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1612.4s)]
*  Don't get going on that. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1613.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1616.48s)]
*  You don't get going on ethanol. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1617.32s)]
*  Yeah, and all that's. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1618.88s)]
*  The number of lectures we've had about ethanol from you [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1620.0s)]
*  is like, so you're not, just to be clear, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1623.2s)]
*  you're not for ethanol. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1624.72s)]
*  No, you take a look at a gummed up carburetor [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1625.5600000000002s)]
*  from ethanol gas and it's not. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1628.3600000000001s)]
*  The new motors are fine if it's fuel injected [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1630.24s)]
*  and you use it every day, it's not gonna hurt anything. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1632.88s)]
*  But yeah, anytime you store anything for a long, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1635.44s)]
*  ethanol attracts moisture. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1637.4s)]
*  You know, it's what you mix with water so it will burn, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1640.2s)]
*  but it attracts water also. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1643.24s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1646.24s)]
*  Like in your boat, your boat's sitting right there, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1647.0800000000002s)]
*  all the water molecules that jump off the water [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1648.04s)]
*  go into the gas. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1650.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've noticed. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1651.2s)]
*  It'll wreck your motor. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1653.32s)]
*  And it will happen to diesel fuel just like gas. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1654.6399999999999s)]
*  Diesel fuel will soak up water just the way it is. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1656.68s)]
*  It's natural, it's gonna soak up water anyway. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1660.32s)]
*  So what would you, before we get to what the mindset is, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1663.72s)]
*  what would you stockpile? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1667.28s)]
*  Or what do you stockpile? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1671.56s)]
*  I would, ammo. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1673.1599999999999s)]
*  Ammo's good. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1674.68s)]
*  I think ammo's gonna be, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1675.52s)]
*  if it becomes like we just talked about where, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1676.64s)]
*  you know, we're only eight hours from New York City [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1680.4s)]
*  by car here, with very, you know, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1683.0800000000002s)]
*  they can, those people that get displaced in New York [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1686.0400000000002s)]
*  could easily end up here. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1689.3200000000002s)]
*  We're not remote. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1690.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't know what you would call this area, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1692.96s)]
*  suburban, I guess. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1694.3200000000002s)]
*  Suburban. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1695.68s)]
*  Suburbia. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1696.88s)]
*  Maybe a little more remote than suburbia. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1698.2800000000002s)]
*  But it's not super remote. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1700.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1702.24s)]
*  You know, it's not like, it's not like Dacquan, Maine, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1703.0800000000002s)]
*  or anything like that. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1705.96s)]
*  So I think those people are gonna come here, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1707.68s)]
*  or any, you know, just use New York City for a center point, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1709.8400000000001s)]
*  go out 500 mile radius from New York City, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1714.32s)]
*  that's Ohio, Pennsylvania. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1717.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1719.44s)]
*  That's where they're gonna go. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1720.28s)]
*  Probably, they're probably gonna go that way [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1721.1200000000001s)]
*  before they come to Maine. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1722.6000000000001s)]
*  I would think so. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1723.8400000000001s)]
*  Or upstate New York, just cause it's right there. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1724.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1727.96s)]
*  But that's cold up there. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1728.8s)]
*  You know, if you really had to survive, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1730.2s)]
*  to live off the land, and it got that bad, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1733.88s)]
*  you'd probably move out of Maine and go somewhere else. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1737.1200000000001s)]
*  Because the weather's just so bad. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1739.6000000000001s)]
*  Just fertile, fertile. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1740.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1741.28s)]
*  You know, in the food, you know, in that. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1742.1200000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't want to. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1743.5600000000002s)]
*  Although we do pretty good farming in Maine, though. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1744.4s)]
*  In the river valleys. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1746.52s)]
*  Yeah, I know, we do good right in this area. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1747.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, well there's a big river here, so that's why. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1748.92s)]
*  But I don't think there's gonna be any lumber industry. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1751.96s)]
*  You know, if things get bad, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1755.2s)]
*  there's not gonna be any fuel to make lumber with. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1756.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1759.76s)]
*  You know, you're gonna be making earth houses, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1760.6000000000001s)]
*  sod houses, you're gonna be making log cabins again. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1761.96s)]
*  I don't, can't fathom it ever getting that bad, but. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1766.32s)]
*  So you stockpile ammo. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1770.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1772.68s)]
*  And how to make ammo, you should be able to reload. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1774.56s)]
*  Component, primers are tough. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1776.9199999999998s)]
*  You couldn't get primers for a long time. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1778.24s)]
*  What calibers do you reload? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1780.48s)]
*  All the expensive ones that are expensive to buy, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1783.04s)]
*  like 38 Special 357. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1785.24s)]
*  4570. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1788.04s)]
*  4570, definitely, yeah. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1789.0s)]
*  I like 65 Creed more, it's kind of a new caliber. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1792.76s)]
*  It's a nice soft shooting, versatile. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1795.24s)]
*  308's the Swiss Army knife of all, and 30.6. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1798.0s)]
*  308, 30.6, any of those. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1803.6s)]
*  The 30. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1805.96s)]
*  30's good. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1806.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1807.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, stay away from oddball calibers [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1808.48s)]
*  that are gonna be hard to get. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1810.76s)]
*  Like what? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1812.36s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1814.32s)]
*  All these new ones that come out, 6.8 PRC and all, you know. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1815.2s)]
*  Unless you reload, how much ammo are you gonna need [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1820.6000000000001s)]
*  to feed your family? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1823.2s)]
*  You're not gonna, you know, if you've got 10 boxes of shells [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1825.56s)]
*  for your 30.6, you're gonna feed the family [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1828.68s)]
*  for the rest of your existence. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1830.96s)]
*  I asked you why you stockpiled ammo, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1833.56s)]
*  and you mentioned the Exodus from New York City. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1835.2s)]
*  Right, yeah, I think that that's, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1838.24s)]
*  not that I would be able to, I mean, I'm 52 years old [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1840.28s)]
*  and pretty good working physical shape, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1843.1200000000001s)]
*  but I'm certainly not an athlete by any means. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1846.16s)]
*  I think 10 good, strong guys from New York City [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1849.12s)]
*  could probably overtake me with all the ammo that I have. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1851.3999999999999s)]
*  You think so? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1853.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think they, I might stop a couple of them, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1854.8s)]
*  you know what I mean, but I'm not that physically, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1857.76s)]
*  I'm not a combat-oriented type person, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1860.36s)]
*  and I think they could definitely overtake a farm [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1863.52s)]
*  with numbers, like a farm, like, say there was 10 people [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1866.76s)]
*  on my farm, they might stay away [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1869.28s)]
*  if there was 10 people on my farm. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1871.32s)]
*  There's only me and my wife and my parents, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1873.28s)]
*  yeah, no, 10 people could, if it was just me, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1876.52s)]
*  I think they probably could. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1880.96s)]
*  Being realistic, we all like to think we're a badass, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1882.28s)]
*  but, you know, and if they had guns, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1884.88s)]
*  then they could really overtake you easy. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1889.52s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1891.32s)]
*  Because one guy with a gun's not gonna be, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1892.72s)]
*  you know, it's not like the movies, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1895.1200000000001s)]
*  you're not gonna take out 10 guys with guns. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1896.56s)]
*  No, you're probably not. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1898.88s)]
*  No, especially if you've got like a nine millimeter pistol. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1899.92s)]
*  You're not gonna take out. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1904.16s)]
*  You don't believe in nine millimeter pistols? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1906.72s)]
*  They're good for me, you know, anybody in this room, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1908.3600000000001s)]
*  but yeah, you're not gonna take somebody [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1913.3600000000001s)]
*  across the field with it. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1914.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, .308's good. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1917.0800000000002s)]
*  So if you have to have one gun, what is it? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1918.92s)]
*  I'd have a rifle, .308 rifle. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1920.52s)]
*  I'd have maybe a handgun for close combat, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1923.44s)]
*  but I wouldn't, I'd like the military take out the enemy [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1925.72s)]
*  before they get that close, you know, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1931.64s)]
*  which you would have to. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1933.52s)]
*  If you let 10 people assaulting you get close enough [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1936.96s)]
*  within handgun range, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1939.96s)]
*  you're probably not gonna get all 10 of them. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1941.76s)]
*  No, you're done. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1943.32s)]
*  You're done. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1944.1999999999998s)]
*  So you gotta get them while they're out of, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1945.08s)]
*  and I'm not any kind of expert in this field at all, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1948.1599999999999s)]
*  just from watching movies and stuff. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1950.56s)]
*  You watch the guy in the movie that takes out all, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1952.76s)]
*  no, that's not realistic. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1954.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1955.96s)]
*  You know, no, you gotta get those people [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1956.8s)]
*  before they, you know, at a hundred yards out, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1957.96s)]
*  a hundred yards is a long ways, you know. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1960.52s)]
*  By the way, just parenthetically, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1963.72s)]
*  the assassination attempt on Trump, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1966.28s)]
*  20 year old kid, no training, formal training at all [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1970.0s)]
*  with firearms, he's on the roof with a .223, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1974.04s)]
*  and a cop comes up behind him, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1978.2s)]
*  they have some kind of altercation, the cop backs off, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1980.52s)]
*  the kid turns with iron sights and makes 140 yard shot [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1982.64s)]
*  and grazes Trump's ear. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1986.24s)]
*  How would you assess that? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1987.8s)]
*  That's a long shot with open sight. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1989.64s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, that's what I thought. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1991.04s)]
*  All I could have done that with my .33. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1992.8s)]
*  All these Navy SEALs on TV. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1994.52s)]
*  I mean, a .30, .30, which is a lot less accurate [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1995.9199999999998s)]
*  than a .223, I mean, a nine inch plate, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=1999.52s)]
*  a gong at a hundred yards is that big. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2003.36s)]
*  If you can hit the gong open sights and make it ding, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2006.32s)]
*  you're pretty proud of yourself at a hundred yards. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2009.8s)]
*  I can hit a deer at a hundred yards, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2012.12s)]
*  but a deer is bigger than Trump's head, you know, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2013.3999999999999s)]
*  and you aim for the deer's, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2016.04s)]
*  I shot a deer last year really close with a .30, .30, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2018.36s)]
*  I aimed right where I was supposed to aim [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2020.84s)]
*  and I hit him way in the back, broke his, killed him, dead, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2023.0s)]
*  but I was a foot and a half off from where I was aiming. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2025.2800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2028.48s)]
*  So deer's a big target. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2029.3200000000002s)]
*  So if you're lying on the roof of a building [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2030.88s)]
*  and all of a sudden a cop comes up, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2033.5600000000002s)]
*  an armed police officer comes up [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2035.44s)]
*  and you somehow force him back, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2037.88s)]
*  your adrenaline is pumping like never before in your life. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2039.92s)]
*  And then you turn and reset the shot at 140 yards [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2042.5600000000002s)]
*  with iron sights and you hit the man in the ear. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2045.64s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2047.92s)]
*  That's ridiculous, right? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2049.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, if he had a scope, then he would be, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2050.4s)]
*  that would be, he probably, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2053.84s)]
*  if that guy had a scope, Trump would be dead right now. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2055.44s)]
*  If the scope was sighted in. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2058.32s)]
*  If it was sighted in, but also. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2060.04s)]
*  130 yards is, you know, they got the, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2061.96s)]
*  all these guys will come on TV, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2064.1600000000003s)]
*  oh, that's a easy shot. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2065.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2067.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a bootcamp shot. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2068.08s)]
*  Yeah. Really okay. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2068.92s)]
*  But it is, but. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2069.76s)]
*  Kid never was in bootcamp, so. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2070.96s)]
*  Right, yeah, for the, when you deer hunt, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2072.48s)]
*  you never, well, in Maine, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2074.6800000000003s)]
*  we don't shoot anything over a hundred yards. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2075.88s)]
*  There is no a hundred yards in Maine, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2077.84s)]
*  yeah, there is. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2078.96s)]
*  On a logging road or something, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2079.8s)]
*  you get the, we make a Hail Mary shot once in a while [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2080.6400000000003s)]
*  when you see a deer a long ways away. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2083.76s)]
*  I shot a deer, at a deer once it was 250 yards away, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2085.12s)]
*  I hit it and wounded it, so I felt bad. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2087.92s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not gonna do that again. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2089.52s)]
*  That's, you know. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2090.84s)]
*  Did you find him? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2091.84s)]
*  No, I never did get a little bit of blood. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2093.0s)]
*  Actually, there's quite a bit of blood at first [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2095.0s)]
*  and it, blood dried up really fast and I tracked it [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2097.08s)]
*  and I found it's bed, it was a snow. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2100.88s)]
*  I went out 10 o'clock at night to find it [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2102.88s)]
*  and it went down a big gully, up another big gully, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2106.2s)]
*  down another, down and up, going right straight uphill [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2109.04s)]
*  and I found a bed, it was bedded in the snow [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2111.7999999999997s)]
*  and there was a little spot of blood about, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2114.4399999999996s)]
*  size of a quarter, so I think he was probably okay. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2116.52s)]
*  I think I grazed him. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2120.24s)]
*  Like Trump, got a lot of blood when Trump got hit. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2121.7999999999997s)]
*  There was quite a bit of blood, you know, he got grazed. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2123.9199999999996s)]
*  So you think good. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2126.56s)]
*  Well, I'm glad to hear you say that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2127.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, all these experts on TV. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2128.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I can easily, I can shoot something. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2130.2s)]
*  I couldn't shoot, I'd shoot a deer at 250 yards [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2134.04s)]
*  with my, with my- [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2137.16s)]
*  Six five Creedmoor. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2139.24s)]
*  Six five Creedmoor, 308, 36. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2140.08s)]
*  I could easily sight it. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2142.08s)]
*  I don't sight my guns in for that range [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2143.56s)]
*  because I don't hunt that range. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2145.4s)]
*  So they're sighted in for a hundred yards. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2147.04s)]
*  Now, whatever the, I'll just make these numbers up, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2148.7599999999998s)]
*  but a 308 at between a hundred in, say 300 yards, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2151.7599999999998s)]
*  it's like 18 inches or something like that. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2157.16s)]
*  It's quite a drop. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2159.56s)]
*  So you really want to, unless you've got the scope [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2160.48s)]
*  with the little slash marks in it for different ranges. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2162.92s)]
*  If you're into that stuff, that's fine. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2165.48s)]
*  I'm sure you can do those shots, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2166.76s)]
*  but most hunters don't, don't do those shots. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2167.96s)]
*  It takes a little bit of the sporting aspect [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2171.36s)]
*  out of hunting. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2173.08s)]
*  For me it does, but I, then again, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2173.92s)]
*  there's a sporting aspect that holy smokes [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2175.88s)]
*  I'm a really good shot. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2178.2000000000003s)]
*  And I shot a deer at 600 yards. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2179.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2180.96s)]
*  So that's, that's the sporting aspect of that. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2181.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2185.16s)]
*  You can be a sport by sneaking up [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2186.0s)]

*  that you would use for deer hunting, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2228.12s)]
*  which, you know, in a civilian situation, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2230.0s)]
*  it does more damage to the deer [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2233.32s)]
*  because it mushrooms when it goes in [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2234.56s)]
*  and it tears apart more tissue, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2235.96s)]

*  when it goes in there, it's going so fast, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2247.94s)]
*  it turns sideways. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2249.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2250.12s)]

*  You know, they just gotta be ready for a world [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2484.7s)]
*  where everything's not taken care of for them. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2487.74s)]
*  You know, there's no door dash. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2490.5s)]
*  There's no going to the store [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2491.7s)]
*  and getting your stuff already made [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2494.46s)]
*  because there is no store. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2497.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2498.74s)]
*  You know, there is no gas to get to the store. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2499.58s)]
*  You know, and I really don't think it's ever gonna get [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2502.02s)]
*  to that point in my life. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2504.34s)]
*  I hope it doesn't. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2505.74s)]
*  I mean, I don't want that. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2506.62s)]
*  I mean, we live in a beautiful world. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2507.94s)]
*  You know, we're very relaxed. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2510.38s)]
*  Every earning and making money is the easiest part of life. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2512.02s)]
*  I mean, that's the simple part. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2517.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2518.38s)]
*  That's all the other little bullshit [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2519.22s)]
*  coming along with it that makes it hard. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2520.22s)]
*  But yeah, you gotta get the mindset of, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2522.62s)]
*  okay, if things get bad, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2525.2599999999998s)]
*  okay, I'm gonna have to probably abandon your house [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2527.86s)]
*  in Washington, DC. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2531.02s)]
*  I don't know if you're gonna get any money for it, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2532.9s)]
*  if there is any money. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2534.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2535.82s)]
*  You know, what is money? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2536.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2537.66s)]
*  It's just a bunch of stuff on computers. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2538.5s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't mean anything. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2540.3s)]
*  And so, okay, I'm gonna have to abandon my house in DC. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2542.6600000000003s)]
*  Might as well leave your car in DC [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2546.3s)]
*  or hope you got enough gas to get to Maine in your car [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2547.82s)]
*  and hope it's not a big funnel of, like I say, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2551.26s)]
*  Maine's probably a pretty good place. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2553.5s)]
*  Not too many people are gonna go to Maine [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2554.7000000000003s)]
*  when it gets that bad. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2556.0600000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2557.1800000000003s)]
*  They're gonna go to Florida or South Carolina or somewhere. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2558.02s)]
*  For sure. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2561.54s)]
*  For sure, they're not gonna go to Maine. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2562.38s)]
*  So we're probably pretty safe. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2564.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, think and look at it that way. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2565.7000000000003s)]
*  I take, you know, look back at the earlier part [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2567.1400000000003s)]
*  of the conversation, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2569.46s)]
*  no, we're probably pretty safe up here. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2570.3s)]
*  Well, that's the hope. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2572.2200000000003s)]
*  Bad weather keeps bad people out. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2573.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2574.5s)]
*  But yeah, you gotta get that mindset of, you know, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2575.34s)]
*  okay, we're just gonna have to live the, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2576.9s)]
*  maybe practice it a little bit. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2578.78s)]
*  Maybe instead of going on vacation to some resort [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2580.7400000000002s)]
*  in the Caribbean or the French Riviera or something, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2584.34s)]
*  take your family to, you know. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2587.38s)]
*  The woods. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2590.78s)]
*  To Subumic, you know, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2591.62s)]
*  and stay there for two weeks in a tent and just have fun. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2593.42s)]
*  You know, don't have them do fire drills or, you know, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2597.74s)]
*  just go and shoot some tin cans with the 22 and, you know, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2601.18s)]
*  kind of make a game out of it. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2604.7799999999997s)]
*  Like, you know, everybody will talk, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2605.9799999999996s)]
*  well, I don't wanna live in a world that if it gets like that, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2607.62s)]
*  that will be awful. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2609.5s)]
*  No, it's not gonna be awful. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2610.3399999999997s)]
*  You're gonna survive. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2611.7799999999997s)]
*  It's happened many times in history, right? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2612.9799999999996s)]
*  I mean, many cultures have been through that type of- [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2616.02s)]
*  Well, so you're 52, I remember this area, you know, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2618.4599999999996s)]
*  50 years ago, and people kind of lived that way [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2622.3399999999997s)]
*  much closer to that even then, not that long ago, really. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2626.54s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2629.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2631.06s)]
*  I mean, did your mom grow up in a house with running water? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2631.9s)]
*  No, I don't think that the farm that they grew up in here [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2635.14s)]
*  didn't have running water. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2638.82s)]
*  When they moved to Bethel, I don't think they got it shortly, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2639.86s)]
*  but I think they had an outhouse, I know that. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2642.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2645.14s)]
*  Yeah, and I know they didn't have electricity. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2645.98s)]
*  We had a bad well when I was a kid, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2648.18s)]
*  which was no, it didn't phase anybody a bit. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2650.06s)]
*  Our well would go dry in the summertime. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2653.3s)]
*  I remember that, and wells were expensive, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2655.42s)]
*  $5,000 to get a well drilled back then, probably 20,000 now. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2658.06s)]
*  So we just filled up five gallon buckets, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2662.3s)]
*  and that's how we flushed it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2664.1400000000003s)]
*  It wasn't a, I took showers at my grandmother's house, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2665.1s)]
*  in the summer when it was dry, not all year. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2669.1800000000003s)]
*  So it wasn't a, maybe shut the water, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2672.06s)]
*  maybe cut the power off to your house for a week [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2675.1800000000003s)]
*  when you're family, just to see how it, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2677.58s)]
*  just not as a punishment or to be mean or anything like that. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2680.7000000000003s)]
*  It's like, hey, let's make some fun out of this. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2684.54s)]
*  Let's cook our food outside. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2687.06s)]
*  You don't have to go kill a deer or anything like that, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2689.7s)]
*  but buy a leg of lamb at the store. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2691.94s)]
*  And let's just cook this on the fire outside. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2695.06s)]
*  We're gonna shut the electricity off for a week. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2696.82s)]
*  We'll read some books or maybe shut your phone off. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2699.66s)]
*  I don't know if the phones will go bad [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2703.3s)]
*  when all the bad things happen. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2706.74s)]
*  Who knows what's gonna, we don't know what's gonna, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2709.34s)]
*  it could be a, what do they call the bomb [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2710.74s)]
*  when it wipes out all the electrical. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2712.66s)]
*  Like the neutron bomb. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2715.66s)]
*  Yeah, like all the electrical waves and the, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2716.74s)]
*  you know what I'm talking about. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2719.46s)]
*  Oh, EMP attack. Yeah, EMP, yeah. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2720.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't, that's probably, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2722.18s)]
*  would just really freak people out. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2724.54s)]
*  Take a kid's cell phone away when he tries to go to school [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2726.02s)]

*  to have the cell phone in school, which is obvious. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2736.1s)]
*  Why should a kid have a cell phone in school? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2737.98s)]
*  And the schools can't take the cell phones away [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2740.46s)]
*  from the kids. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2742.18s)]
*  They're like, it's not going well for them. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2743.02s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2746.2999999999997s)]
*  His kids are so addicted to it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2747.14s)]

*  no, my kid has to have the cell phone. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2749.14s)]

*  to keep the thing in the locker during class. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2752.74s)]
*  So in between class, they just go to their locker [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2755.66s)]
*  and get out the cell phone. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2757.66s)]

*  You know, working or who wants to, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2781.1000000000004s)]
*  who would want to waste their money? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2782.78s)]
*  Why does the eighth grader need us? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2784.1800000000003s)]
*  The school gives them computers. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2785.42s)]
*  They all have a laptop. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2787.0600000000004s)]
*  The politicians did that. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2788.82s)]
*  So every kid has a laptop. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2790.1400000000003s)]
*  Then the kid's parents were like, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2793.46s)]
*  selling the laptop, pawning the laptop to buy drugs with. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2794.7400000000002s)]
*  That was funny on that. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2798.0600000000004s)]

*  because we knew it was gonna happen, right? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2802.6200000000003s)]

*  You know, play some music while they're stacking the wood. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2827.9s)]
*  You know, you get six of your family members together [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2830.82s)]
*  to do the firewood. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2833.34s)]
*  It goes pretty fast. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2834.1800000000003s)]
*  Did you do firewood as a kid? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2836.46s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was, I loved cutting wood. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2837.6600000000003s)]
*  I love firewood. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2839.9s)]
*  It's kind of like, I hate painting, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2840.78s)]
*  but there are certain times when I don't mind painting [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2843.42s)]
*  if I just want to forget about something. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2846.26s)]
*  Like simple little chores like that are so, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2848.38s)]
*  like weed whacking. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2851.82s)]
*  The best. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2853.26s)]
*  Chainsawing, just going through the woods [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2854.1s)]
*  and cutting up a bunch of dead trees [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2855.98s)]
*  with the chainsaw for no reason. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2857.3s)]
*  I used to go after tapings if I was feeling tense [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2858.38s)]
*  or go out in the woods and cut, as you know. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2862.58s)]
*  But then I put that ethanol gas in my chainsaw. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2865.18s)]
*  Then you got the electric chainsaw. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2867.22s)]
*  I got the electric chainsaw, do you remember that? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2869.66s)]
*  That was fun though. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2871.14s)]
*  It's, I mean, it was fine. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2872.7400000000002s)]
*  The electric chainsaw was fine, but. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2874.18s)]
*  Good for about an hour. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2875.58s)]
*  It's good for about an hour. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2876.42s)]
*  It's exactly right. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2877.26s)]
*  Yeah, no, so make a game out of things. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2878.46s)]
*  Like don't, you know, buy your kid a dirt bike. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2880.42s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2885.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2886.46s)]
*  You know, but don't, don't, I had dirt bikes [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2887.3s)]
*  and snowmobiles when I was a kid, but I remember my, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2890.1800000000003s)]
*  and it was around my grandfather a lot [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2893.5s)]
*  because he lived right next door and he was retired. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2895.62s)]
*  So I was around him a lot and he'd be like, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2897.3s)]
*  no, we don't have any, you know, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2899.42s)]
*  that's enough gas for today. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2900.86s)]
*  And I was fine with it. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2902.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like, okay, I get to ride it for a couple hours, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2903.58s)]
*  but gas was pretty expensive when I was a kid. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2905.4s)]
*  Early eighties, wasn't cheap. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2907.9s)]
*  I think it was like a buck 70. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2910.38s)]
*  One time there it was what? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2912.3s)]
*  Like a buck 70 a gallon or something like that. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2913.62s)]
*  Maybe dropped at the eighties. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2915.94s)]
*  Yeah, at the end of the eighties, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2917.66s)]
*  it went back down to like a buck a gallon. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2918.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2920.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, my grandfather would, you know, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2921.1s)]
*  he filling up to have somebody fill up a five gallon can [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2922.86s)]
*  for me to ride a snowmobile around in a field [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2926.42s)]
*  was a big deal. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2928.14s)]
*  I mean, it was a luxury for me as a kid. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2928.98s)]
*  And it was, I appreciated it. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2931.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, I'd say, jeez, can I have two gallons of gas today? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2933.66s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2936.22s)]
*  You know, whoops, you helped with the firewood. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2937.38s)]
*  You're gonna have some gas, you know. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2939.2599999999998s)]
*  Did you help with your grandparents' firewood also? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2941.18s)]
*  He burned a lot. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2943.7s)]
*  He had a big farmhouse. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2944.54s)]
*  He split, he did his wood by hand. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2945.98s)]
*  Really? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2948.5s)]
*  Yeah, he cut it with a chainsaw, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2949.3399999999997s)]
*  but he would line them all up, split them by hand, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2950.22s)]
*  line them up on the road. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2952.1s)]
*  He had a whole line of firewood split up by hand. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2953.2599999999998s)]
*  Then he had a chute that went down into a cellar. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2955.3399999999997s)]
*  We'd all get together and throw it in the cellar. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2957.98s)]
*  How much did he burn in winter? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2960.7799999999997s)]
*  I'd say about 10 gourd. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2962.06s)]
*  He burned a lot. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2963.2599999999998s)]
*  He had a big farmhouse. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2964.1s)]
*  Then when he got older, they put a boil furnace in [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2965.7799999999997s)]
*  because he was like in his eighties [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2968.1s)]
*  and it was too much for him to do the firewood. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2969.3399999999997s)]
*  Do you notice the difference between wood heat and oil heat? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2972.46s)]
*  Oh yeah, definitely it's not. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2974.62s)]
*  Oil heat's fast, faster. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2975.9s)]
*  If you come home from a day of being out, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2981.78s)]
*  just soaked to the bone, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2985.2200000000003s)]
*  like say you're doing carpentry all day in the cold [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2986.7s)]
*  and your hands are just frozen and your feet are wet [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2990.14s)]
*  and you're just cold, stinging cold, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2993.34s)]
*  and you just stand in front of that wood stove [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2996.7s)]
*  and it almost burns as you're warming. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=2998.38s)]
*  You almost have to step away from it. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3001.5s)]
*  It's like, okay, too hot, too fast. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3002.9s)]
*  Like jumping in a hot tub when you're cold, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3005.1s)]
*  you know how it kind of burns. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3006.54s)]
*  And it's just, but it heats you, it will warm your core up. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3008.3s)]
*  Now standing in front of a register, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3011.9s)]
*  radiator in the hallway doesn't, you don't- [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3015.5s)]
*  A forced air vent. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3017.86s)]
*  Yeah, forced air vent. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3018.7s)]
*  Forced air is actually better than a register, I think, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3019.58s)]
*  than a forced air vent. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3023.46s)]
*  It's actually warm air blowing on you. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3024.54s)]
*  That feels pretty good. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3025.9s)]
*  I like forced air better than the radiant heat myself. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3027.18s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3029.98s)]
*  Because the radiant heat's kind of, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3030.86s)]
*  it's just there, but it's not hot. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3032.1400000000003s)]
*  It's just like a constant, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3035.5s)]
*  if you were frozen and you were laying on next to a radiator [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3037.98s)]
*  or a radiant heat system, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3041.7400000000002s)]
*  it would take a long time to warm up. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3042.86s)]
*  But a forced air one's blowing warm air on you. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3044.1400000000003s)]
*  It seems to just warm you up a little bit faster. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3046.34s)]
*  Do you think any of the people who run our country [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3048.86s)]
*  could answer any of the questions I've asked you? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3050.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3052.46s)]
*  They put the people that, well, you talk about it [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3053.3s)]
*  all the time. The most retarded people [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3059.46s)]
*  in charge. Yeah, like put the guy [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3061.54s)]
*  that can't do eighth grade math [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3062.3799999999997s)]
*  in charge of the energy grid. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3065.1s)]
*  And then, okay, maybe he's a good leader, right? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3070.22s)]
*  You really, and I wanna bug it. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3073.2599999999998s)]
*  We'll get back to that, but he's a good leader, right? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3076.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3078.7s)]
*  So he can't do eighth grade math, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3079.98s)]
*  but he's a good organizer. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3081.62s)]
*  He's a good leader. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3082.74s)]
*  He's gonna hire the, he's gonna hire a bunch of engineers, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3083.56s)]
*  guys who went to MIT and good common sense people. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3086.58s)]
*  No, he doesn't hire the, he doesn't even hire those people. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3089.94s)]
*  Who does he hire? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3094.54s)]
*  He just hires more people just like him, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3095.38s)]
*  just more like-minded people like him that have the same, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3097.34s)]
*  you know, I'll just make these numbers. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3100.9s)]
*  I tried to do some of this research right before I got here. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3102.86s)]
*  Have you ever looked up on the internet, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3105.86s)]
*  like how much electricity a windmill produces [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3107.18s)]
*  or how much electricity a ski lift uses? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3110.46s)]
*  No. There's like no, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3113.98s)]
*  you know, don't trust everything you read on the internet. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3116.18s)]
*  Very vague answers and a lot of that stuff. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3118.38s)]
*  And really? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3120.78s)]
*  Yeah. You know, you think it'd be cut and dry. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3121.62s)]
*  Of course. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3123.62s)]
*  Like a, you know, a chair, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3124.46s)]
*  windmill puts out so many kilowatts [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3125.5s)]
*  and a chair lift uses this many, well, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3127.98s)]
*  and they just go around in a circle. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3130.78s)]
*  Well, it depends on how long the chair lift is [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3132.2200000000003s)]
*  and how many chair, well, obviously it depends on that. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3134.7400000000002s)]
*  How about the average chair lift? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3137.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the average chair lift. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3138.42s)]
*  How about the average windmill in an average year? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3139.26s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3141.3s)]
*  You can get those specs on your truck. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3142.1400000000003s)]
*  They'll tell you exactly how many horsepower [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3143.58s)]
*  under certain circumstances your motor produces. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3145.3s)]
*  And then look up how much it costs to charge your cyber truck. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3147.14s)]
*  And it's like, well, it depends on where you live [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3150.3399999999997s)]
*  and the, which it does depend on where you live [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3152.8599999999997s)]
*  in the electricity rates, you know? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3154.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3156.54s)]
*  It might be 18 cents a kilowatt hour here. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3157.3799999999997s)]
*  It might be 23 cents here, but you could say, okay, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3160.22s)]
*  it costs 50 bucks to charge your, you know, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3163.7s)]
*  they don't give the, they just lead you around in a circle [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3166.46s)]
*  cause they're trying to push all this stuff on you. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3169.46s)]
*  Like I read somewhere that the, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3172.7s)]
*  I mean, I don't believe everything I read, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3175.18s)]
*  especially on that, cause you know, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3176.58s)]
*  the wackos that are trying to push all this stuff on you [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3179.42s)]
*  are really, really, you know, leading you down the wrong path. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3182.86s)]
*  And the wackos that are trying to disprove them [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3186.7799999999997s)]
*  are really, really pulling you off the other path. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3188.86s)]
*  You know, like, oh, the wind never blows, you know? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3191.7s)]
*  The wind never blows. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3194.1s)]
*  You know? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3195.42s)]
*  So, so, but I looked up a thing for how much energy it took [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3196.42s)]
*  to run the New York subway. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3202.8199999999997s)]
*  Cause I know trains use a lot of power. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3204.14s)]
*  And the thing that, and I did all the math [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3206.7799999999997s)]
*  of the kilowatt hours and how much, you know, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3210.02s)]
*  it was just getting, I'm not an engineer [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3212.98s)]
*  and it was very misleading the information [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3215.18s)]
*  that the solar panel companies are putting out. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3217.4599999999996s)]
*  But, and then I read somewhere, I read this article [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3219.66s)]
*  and the guy said, yeah, like the size of Arizona, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3222.2999999999997s)]
*  solar panels, just to run the New York subway, not the city. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3225.06s)]
*  To start a subway car, you just to get the subway car rolling [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3229.54s)]
*  with 10 units hooked to the motor, to the engine, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3234.06s)]
*  just to get it rolling, not to keep it going, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3239.2599999999998s)]
*  just to get it rolling, uses, would power 1300 average homes [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3242.22s)]
*  for a year. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3247.18s)]
*  No way. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3248.02s)]
*  Yeah, cause it takes a lot of power [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3249.62s)]
*  to get electricity going. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3251.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3252.34s)]
*  Like the local sawmill and the local ski area [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3253.18s)]
*  have to coordinate with the, while they used to, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3255.66s)]
*  probably not now, but they used to, the mills in areas [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3257.62s)]
*  have to coordinate with the power grid [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3260.86s)]
*  when they're gonna start their shifts. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3262.22s)]
*  If they're running shifts and the machines aren't running, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3264.18s)]
*  cause you can't turn on that sawmill [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3266.58s)]
*  and turn on all the chair lifts at the same time. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3267.9399999999996s)]
*  It uses that much energy to get it going. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3270.54s)]
*  So sawmills electric? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3272.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the big ones, like the big, big sawmills, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3273.8199999999997s)]
*  you know, the huge ones. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3276.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3277.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's what runs the blade on the. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3278.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but why not diesel or gasoline? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3280.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, it's just smoother motor. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3283.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean, less vibration and you don't want [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3284.8599999999997s)]
*  the big diesel motor humming next to your head all day. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3286.4599999999996s)]
*  It might be electric. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3288.8599999999997s)]
*  A lot of sawmills will have their own power plant. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3289.9s)]
*  They'll have two big diesel generators out back running [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3292.42s)]
*  that run the electric motors. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3295.42s)]
*  Like an asphalt plant has a big diesel motor [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3296.94s)]
*  that the asphalt plant's all electric, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3299.42s)]
*  but we had a diesel motor sitting there, like a train. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3302.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3305.7400000000002s)]
*  A train, you see the black smoke rolling out of the train [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3306.58s)]
*  going down the tracks. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3308.78s)]
*  It's an electric motor. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3309.62s)]
*  It's just a diesel generator powering the electric motor. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3311.5s)]
*  So if we go to electric vehicles and AI is running them. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3314.3s)]
*  In 2030, Vermont has to be a hundred percent electric. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3319.3s)]
*  They've passed the law already. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3323.0600000000004s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3325.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3326.42s)]
*  Well, the sale of electric, a hundred percent. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3327.26s)]
*  Is that simple? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3330.1000000000004s)]
*  What do you, so you live very dangerously close to Vermont. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3330.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3333.7000000000003s)]
*  What do you, do you ever go over there? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3334.54s)]
*  Yeah, we used to go to Vermont quite often. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3336.0600000000004s)]
*  My parents had a monument gravestone business [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3338.02s)]
*  and that's where we got our stones. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3342.62s)]
*  So I've been to Vermont a lot back and forth. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3343.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3347.14s)]
*  And yeah, that's like Maine. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3347.98s)]
*  It's you can drive, if you drive down a cross route [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3349.46s)]
*  to Vermont, it's the same little, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3351.46s)]
*  little more mountainous over there through Mount Washington, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3352.98s)]
*  but for the most part it's, it's, it's the same. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3355.2999999999997s)]
*  But not everyone in the, I mean, a lot of normal people. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3358.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3360.5s)]
*  A lot of rednecks over there and regular people. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3361.34s)]
*  So they're all going to have to go electric, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3364.34s)]
*  like electric chainsaw. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3365.94s)]
*  When they pass one of those bills, I mean, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3367.34s)]
*  this might be one of those questions [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3370.1s)]
*  that nobody knows the answer to. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3371.82s)]
*  When they pass one of those bills [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3372.86s)]
*  that California passed the bill all electric by 2035, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3374.38s)]
*  what does that mean? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3377.46s)]
*  Does anybody actually know, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3378.98s)]
*  does that mean that they're really not going to sell [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3380.2200000000003s)]
*  any gasoline vehicles in California after 2035? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3384.3s)]

*  Well, you said a lot of electric motors [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3388.58s)]
*  are powered by diesel generators. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3390.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3393.42s)]
*  Ski areas, a lot of ski lifts have the diesel motor [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3394.82s)]

*  some are just direct drive diesel lifts. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3407.46s)]
*  So I'm starting to think that reality [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3409.26s)]

*  I very rarely drive 200 miles a day. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3428.3s)]

*  or South Carolina, and I got to go somewhere real fast [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3444.1800000000003s)]
*  and hop in my car and drive. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3447.34s)]
*  Oh shit, my car's only half full now. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3448.54s)]

*  getting that cement, because I didn't know. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3460.42s)]
*  I'd never been on a long trip with it. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3461.78s)]
*  So I'm looking up supercharging stations [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3463.62s)]
*  on the way to the cement place. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3465.34s)]
*  Oh, no, there isn't any. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3466.58s)]
*  There's slow charging stations that take eight hours. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3468.18s)]
*  It's just a 120 volt- [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3470.78s)]
*  Well, probably a 220 plug, yeah. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3474.26s)]
*  I charge it at my house with 220, but yeah, the electric, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3476.02s)]
*  the power grid and the diesel and the nuclear would be great. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3478.9s)]
*  Hydro dams would be Canada. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3484.6600000000003s)]
*  Doesn't Canada get all this power from hydro? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3486.38s)]
*  Like all of it, right? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3488.14s)]
*  You know what the hydro dams in Maine, Brookfield. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3488.98s)]
*  Right, so why, obviously they've got the methods [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3490.86s)]
*  to make hydro dams to where the pipe, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3495.7000000000003s)]
*  they tap into the bottom of the river with a pipe. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3498.1s)]
*  They do it all over the place and the pipe runs [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3501.3s)]
*  underneath the ground to the turbine, pops out down river. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3503.98s)]
*  So there's no dam, you're not losing any, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3509.7000000000003s)]

*  you know what I mean? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3517.4199999999996s)]

*  They seem time consuming and hard. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3528.02s)]

*  You read about all these politicians that got rich off the, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3715.58s)]
*  and people don't like reading that. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3718.22s)]
*  You know, six pack Joe going to the store, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3720.18s)]
*  reads in the paper that so-and-so politician [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3722.58s)]
*  has all of a sudden got rich off windmills. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3725.02s)]
*  He's not dumb, he can figure out what's going on. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3727.66s)]
*  You know, the windmill project in Rhode Island, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3730.5s)]
*  according to the, I watch a lot of YouTube. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3733.18s)]
*  It's very, it's good. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3737.54s)]
*  I mean, it's almost a default. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3739.86s)]
*  Most people I know, it's a default TV now, is YouTube. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3741.06s)]
*  I mean, the windmill project in Rhode Island, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3743.82s)]
*  I don't know the name of the project, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3748.54s)]
*  but it's in the news all the time. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3749.78s)]
*  Offshore windmills. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3750.86s)]
*  Yeah, offshore windmills in the ocean. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3751.78s)]
*  So the Kennedy type people don't want it [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3753.5s)]
*  because it's in their backyard. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3756.38s)]
*  And you know, the Obama's people that live in Nantucket [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3757.6200000000003s)]
*  and Rhode Island and all those fancy places don't want it. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3761.42s)]
*  They want to send, they want to send, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3764.82s)]
*  they want to put them up in, you know, Rangeley, Maine. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3766.06s)]
*  Because, you know, we're not going to, we don't care up here. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3769.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, what do we care? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3772.7s)]
*  About natural beauty and like living a decent life. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3774.8599999999997s)]
*  But that windmill is huge and it provides one 700th. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3778.3399999999997s)]
*  And the guy, he wrote it out on a piece of paper [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3784.98s)]
*  and did the math of the kilowatt hours. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3787.46s)]
*  He was smarter than I was. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3789.02s)]
*  One 700th of the electricity that it takes to power, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3790.5s)]
*  not just the area that it's going to power, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3794.1s)]
*  but Rhode Island, which is the size of that coffee cup. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3796.54s)]
*  So the windmill project with the wind blowing, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3799.9s)]
*  a 700th of what Rhode Island uses for power. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3803.7000000000003s)]
*  And they've shut down either one or two big power plants [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3806.7000000000003s)]
*  in Rhode Island. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3811.2200000000003s)]
*  And they wrecked a commercial fishery. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3812.06s)]
*  They wrecked a commercial fishery too. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3813.78s)]
*  And the windmills were already falling apart [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3815.1800000000003s)]
*  out in the ocean. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3818.1800000000003s)]
*  One came apart. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3819.02s)]
*  I don't know where it was. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3819.86s)]
*  It was on the news. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3820.6800000000003s)]
*  I just kind of laughed when I walked by the TV [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3821.52s)]
*  because the windmill was all, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3822.94s)]
*  the blade was sticking down in the ocean. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3824.1800000000003s)]
*  And the environmentalist people were worried [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3828.46s)]
*  that the material that the blade was made out of [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3830.26s)]
*  was going to poison the fish. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3833.26s)]
*  So who said that it's okay to, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3836.42s)]
*  well, I guess windmills would be our biggest thing here. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3839.38s)]
*  Solar panels are pretty, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3841.54s)]
*  there's a few solar farms around, but they're small. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3843.38s)]
*  Maybe 10 acres or something. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3846.5s)]
*  So they're not too offensive yet. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3847.9s)]
*  They're not, well, I don't know. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3849.78s)]
*  When you get off the turnpike in gray, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3851.62s)]
*  that one's kind of offensive when I see that one. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3854.08s)]
*  It used to be cows in that field. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3856.06s)]
*  Now there's windmills. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3857.4s)]
*  I mean, now there's solar panels. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3859.64s)]
*  But the windmill, who's to dynamite the top of a mountain? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3862.6800000000003s)]
*  You got to build a road up there to get the, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3866.1600000000003s)]
*  windmill projects are used. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3868.1600000000003s)]
*  My neighbor does them. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3869.2000000000003s)]
*  And they're, you got to blast the top of a mountain range. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3870.52s)]
*  Blast it. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3874.12s)]
*  Just to flatten off a spot to put these windmills [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3875.76s)]
*  and build a road to it and maintain the road to it. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3878.48s)]
*  And the erosion from maintaining the road every, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3881.52s)]
*  who's, have they, it's like cash for clunkers [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3883.64s)]
*  and they wanted in, what was that early 2000s trade in [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3886.36s)]
*  your- Obama, yeah. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3888.92s)]
*  Yeah, trade in your, you know, Ford Bronco [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3890.0s)]
*  for a Toyota Tacoma. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3893.56s)]
*  And you've got $4,000 for your Ford Bronco. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3896.92s)]
*  Well, sounds great. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3899.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you're driving something that gets 25 miles a gallon [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3900.0s)]
*  versus something that, you know, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3903.0s)]
*  gets 15 miles to the gallon. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3904.84s)]
*  But the natural resources that it took to build that [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3907.28s)]
*  better gas mileage car versus keeping that [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3910.6s)]
*  Ford Bronco on the road and not mining all that new steel [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3915.16s)]
*  and rubber and all the resources that it takes [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3919.92s)]
*  to build that car. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3923.08s)]
*  They didn't fake, they didn't really factor that [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3924.24s)]
*  into the whole point. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3926.08s)]
*  Okay, this guy's only driving 5,000 miles a year [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3927.16s)]
*  in his 96 Bronco that gets 10 miles to the gallon. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3930.56s)]
*  So you give him $4,000 of our money to buy a Toyota Tacoma [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3935.12s)]
*  that gets better gas mileage. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3939.16s)]
*  It took, they're all going to be off the road in 10 years, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3940.56s)]
*  rust it out anyway, but maybe he's maintaining that Bronco. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3943.24s)]
*  Maybe it's, you know, not rusted or he just, you know, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3947.0s)]
*  anything, doesn't matter. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3950.7599999999998s)]
*  But why is that better to just junk that and get rid of it [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3951.72s)]
*  and buy the new car? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3956.8799999999997s)]
*  Someone's getting rich from it. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3958.3999999999996s)]
*  Someone's got, and that was a whole scam [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3959.24s)]
*  on the cash for clunkers. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3960.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't know if you have ever reported on that, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3961.9199999999996s)]
*  but I don't remember the particulars of it, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3963.7999999999997s)]
*  but it was a scam. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3965.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, they get rich on it. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3966.2s)]
*  It's all a scam and nothing's a bigger scam than wind power. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3967.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's like, that's huge. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3971.08s)]
*  You read those articles and then, you know, they don't, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3973.56s)]
*  they're not on the everyday news, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3977.0s)]
*  but there's been articles on the local papers [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3979.16s)]
*  about the scamming. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3981.7599999999998s)]
*  Have you ever shot one with a 308? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3982.7599999999998s)]
*  I'd love to shoot one. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3984.44s)]
*  They were going to put them behind my house on my mountain. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3985.7599999999998s)]
*  That was a big thing. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3988.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, my wife was going to the meetings [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3989.08s)]
*  and my neighbor was, had the signs up, no windmills. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3990.7599999999998s)]
*  And the bat, there was a bat, species of bat up there [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3993.7599999999998s)]
*  that was rare or a breeding ground for bat breeding grounds. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=3999.6000000000004s)]
*  And that was apparently why they didn't do it [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4004.1200000000003s)]
*  and the money for them. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4006.84s)]
*  I think when Trump got in, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4008.5600000000004s)]
*  didn't a lot of that stuff dry up? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4009.44s)]
*  I don't know, probably not. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4010.7200000000003s)]
*  I think, I don't know, but something happened politically, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4011.6800000000003s)]
*  but it was a bat thing that was holding them back. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4014.36s)]
*  And that was the way, and they still have a hundred year. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4016.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't know if it's a lease or an agreement [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4020.84s)]
*  that they could still go up there and do it. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4022.4s)]
*  If they put those windmills in, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4024.36s)]
*  what caliber rifle would have stopped them? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4026.5200000000004s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4029.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4030.3199999999997s)]
*  I think you got to hit them right in the middle. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4031.16s)]
*  I don't think a bullet hole through the tip of the wing [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4033.24s)]
*  is going to, it's like shooting an airplane [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4036.2799999999997s)]
*  with a bullet in the wing. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4037.7599999999998s)]
*  It's really not going to stop the plane. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4038.68s)]
*  You got to hit the guts of it. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4040.24s)]
*  You really get it. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4042.4s)]
*  And this is going to, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4043.24s)]
*  I'm usually right about these kinds of things. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4045.56s)]
*  Okay, in 50 years when these windmills, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4048.96s)]
*  probably 30 years, when these windmills are abandoned [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4051.7999999999997s)]
*  and falling apart, they're just, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4054.56s)]
*  nobody's taking care of them anymore. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4057.04s)]
*  The whole industry is bankrupt. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4059.48s)]
*  They're falling over on the side of the mountain. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4060.32s)]
*  They're just wasted. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4061.88s)]
*  People are going to go there [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4063.56s)]
*  and there's going to be no freaking wire [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4065.48s)]
*  going to the thing to start with. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4066.6s)]
*  It's that much of a scam. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4067.56s)]
*  Like there's not even a wire going to the thing. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4069.04s)]
*  That's my prediction. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4070.96s)]
*  So you think we're going to discover [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4072.48s)]
*  this whole thing is bullshit. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4073.68s)]
*  They're not actually producing power. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4075.52s)]
*  Yeah, they're not even hooked up. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4076.36s)]
*  There's nothing on the inside. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4077.36s)]
*  It's just big blades. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4078.44s)]
*  There's no generator on the inside or anything. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4079.2799999999997s)]
*  Have you ever been on that? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4082.0s)]
*  I'm that much of a weirdo that I think. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4082.84s)]
*  I don't think that's weird at all. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4084.0s)]
*  I don't think it's weird at all. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4085.36s)]
*  This kid, this 20 year old kid with no training [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4086.44s)]
*  just shot Trump at 140 yards with a 223. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4089.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4092.36s)]
*  Anything is possible. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4093.2000000000003s)]
*  That's for sure, yeah. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4094.32s)]
*  Have you ever been up and poked around the windmills? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4095.92s)]
*  I've never been, not those big ones. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4099.24s)]
*  I mean, I've been up towers and stuff. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4102.76s)]
*  I've climbed towers before, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4104.16s)]
*  but I've never been up a windmill tower. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4105.28s)]
*  No, I don't like getting near them. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4106.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4107.84s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4109.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4109.96s)]
*  They're just not, they're not scenic. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4110.8s)]
*  I don't want to spend, I'm not going to, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4111.92s)]
*  I'm not going to go to take my vacation in the Bronx. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4113.92s)]
*  I'm not going to go hang out next to a frigging windmill. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4116.16s)]
*  You know, it's basically the same thing to me. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4119.36s)]
*  My friend has a camp. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4121.8s)]
*  You've been there where you look out the porch [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4122.84s)]
*  and you see the 22 windmills on the mountain. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4124.88s)]
*  I don't know, it kind of ruins it for me. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4129.12s)]
*  I agree. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4131.04s)]
*  Maybe I'm just being selfish. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4131.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4134.2s)]
*  No, they're being selfish actually. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4135.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4136.5199999999995s)]
*  They're moving them into poor areas [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4137.36s)]
*  where the towns have been depopulated [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4139.2s)]
*  because of changes that they instituted to our economy. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4141.32s)]
*  And the town can't say no [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4144.16s)]
*  because they need the money. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4145.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4146.92s)]
*  Yeah, they're buying off the people that can be bought off. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4148.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4150.8s)]
*  Cheap. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4151.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4152.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's like selling the family farm [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4153.320000000001s)]
*  to send your kid to college type of theory, right? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4156.52s)]
*  Is that such, is it such a good idea that we're doing this? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4159.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, selling our mountain tops to the windmill people [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4163.360000000001s)]
*  for some quick cash right now? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4166.72s)]
*  You know, is that the best thing for our future? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4169.320000000001s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4171.64s)]
*  It actually, it sounds like a crime. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4173.4s)]
*  It should be. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4177.12s)]
*  I mean, especially when there's like no vote on it. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4177.96s)]
*  Like, you know, I hate to pick on rich people, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4179.679999999999s)]
*  but the rich people own the land. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4183.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4186.0s)]
*  And they're selling basically, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4186.839999999999s)]
*  they're not really doing anything with it. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4187.759999999999s)]
*  They log it. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4189.16s)]
*  We've been logging it for years. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4190.0s)]
*  The poor people do benefit from it. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4191.12s)]
*  The working class, the paper mills benefit from it. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4193.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4196.0s)]
*  That industry is kind of drying up [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4197.04s)]
*  from what we saw the other day. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4198.719999999999s)]
*  And okay, well, this is our last chance [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4201.04s)]
*  to get just a little bit more money out of that land. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4203.8s)]
*  We'll some frigging scam deal with the government [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4206.0s)]
*  to put windmills on it, you know? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4209.16s)]
*  One last little push. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4211.32s)]
*  Give the little people a little something [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4212.68s)]
*  so they can build a new school or something [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4215.16s)]
*  out of the money or put a new road in or something. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4216.84s)]
*  It's, they're selling their soul. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4220.92s)]
*  You really are. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4222.48s)]
*  You always feel you're selling, when you're selling land. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4223.88s)]
*  I've sold land before, you know, kind of because I had to, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4225.68s)]
*  or I was moving or relocating or I needed the money. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4228.6s)]
*  And it just felt so soul burning. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4231.88s)]
*  Like I didn't feel good afterwards. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4233.28s)]
*  No, you shouldn't feel good. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4234.76s)]
*  After I sell that land. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4235.6s)]
*  I mean, I had to, and I did no regrets against it. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4236.56s)]
*  You know, I did, I got a lot of land now. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4239.24s)]
*  So I made out better, you know? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4241.76s)]
*  I think I bettered myself doing it. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4244.72s)]
*  But while I was doing it, I'm like, man, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4246.88s)]
*  I'm selling land that belonged to my grandfather. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4248.32s)]
*  Like I really don't, I just don't feel good. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4250.44s)]
*  Even though it wasn't much, it was only a couple of acres. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4253.44s)]
*  You know, I needed to pay some bills and, you know, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4255.92s)]
*  buy some stuff. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4258.72s)]
*  I'm like, I just don't feel good doing this, you know? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4259.56s)]
*  That's right. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4262.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4262.84s)]
*  When those windmills break, who's gonna cart them off? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4263.68s)]
*  And what happens to them? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4267.64s)]
*  They're big. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4268.4800000000005s)]
*  You ever seen one going down the road, the blade? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4269.320000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4271.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they like take up the whole road. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4272.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what they, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4273.72s)]
*  and the motors on the inside and the bearings, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4275.04s)]
*  the construction company in town bought a crane, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4278.360000000001s)]
*  just to like a $4 million crane, just to work on them. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4280.56s)]
*  You need that big equipment. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4283.6s)]
*  So you can't tell me that going around and maintaining, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4284.96s)]
*  there's a lot of windmills in Maine now. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4288.96s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4290.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4291.36s)]
*  And they still only provide supposedly 16% [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4292.2s)]
*  of the power from Maine. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4296.44s)]
*  Now I don't, they say to Maine, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4298.56s)]
*  that's another thing when you read these things, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4301.4800000000005s)]
*  you have to really watch what you read [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4303.56s)]
*  because the 16% of the power from Maine is the residents. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4306.6s)]
*  And then another article said that that doesn't, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4310.84s)]
*  I don't know if this is true or not. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4313.76s)]
*  It's just what I read on the internet. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4314.92s)]
*  That the, that doesn't include industrial power. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4316.84s)]
*  The resident, well, houses use very little electricity. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4320.04s)]
*  It doesn't take much to power the houses in Maine. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4322.76s)]
*  They use most of the electricity, but they use very little. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4324.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4327.68s)]
*  But the factories and stuff, and they use power. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4328.52s)]
*  Ski areas use a shitload of power. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4331.88s)]
*  What do you think of ski areas? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4334.64s)]
*  I like to ski. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4336.68s)]
*  I've always skied. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4337.84s)]
*  I don't ski anymore. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4338.96s)]
*  Just, I don't, it's too crowded for me now. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4340.0s)]
*  I know it's like waiting in line at Walmart. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4342.52s)]
*  When I go skiing, that's what I feel like I'm doing. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4344.8s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4347.16s)]
*  It's like, it's another thing kind of selling your soul. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4348.24s)]
*  You know, all right, let's, like I said, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4351.24s)]
*  bulldoze the top of this mountain off [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4353.6s)]
*  and cut all the trees and cause a shitload of erosion. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4355.2s)]
*  Just so a bunch of rich people can slide down the hill. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4358.12s)]
*  You know? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4361.84s)]
*  That seemed like you don't see too many poor people skiing. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4363.280000000001s)]
*  You don't? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4365.4800000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4366.320000000001s)]
*  They don't have ghetto day at the ski area. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4367.4800000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4369.280000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like golf courses. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4370.52s)]
*  Golf courses are beautiful. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4372.12s)]
*  And I think once something is done, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4373.8s)]
*  I think it's one thing. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4376.28s)]
*  Like once a wind farm is in or once a ski area is constructed, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4378.08s)]
*  I think the damage is done and Mother Nature [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4383.16s)]
*  kind of heals itself and does what it's gonna do. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4385.2s)]
*  You know, but it's the process of it. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4388.88s)]
*  Can kill a lot of fish, I'm sure. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4391.04s)]
*  I mean, fish biologists will tell you [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4393.4400000000005s)]
*  that golf courses are the worst thing for fish. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4394.76s)]
*  For sure. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4398.320000000001s)]
*  You know, golf courses, I don't play, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4399.16s)]
*  I enjoy, I like looking at golf courses. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4401.28s)]
*  They're beautiful, they're mold, I like nice, you know, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4403.599999999999s)]
*  they look nice, they got the trees and everything. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4406.04s)]
*  But man, you can't look at a golf course and just think, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4407.8s)]
*  man, why, who thought this was a good idea [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4411.12s)]
*  to fill in this swamp and bulldoze all this land [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4414.32s)]
*  and flatten it off and cut all the trees [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4416.719999999999s)]
*  just so I can hit this little white ball into a hole? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4418.4s)]
*  You know, who had that vision [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4421.36s)]
*  that that's what we should be doing with this land? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4424.2s)]
*  Same thing with the ski area. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4427.04s)]
*  You know, looking at the beautiful mountain [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4428.599999999999s)]
*  and you get this ski lift going off the side. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4430.04s)]
*  Who thought, oh Jesus, what a great place for a ski area. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4432.64s)]
*  You know, I guess it's your personal preference [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4436.48s)]
*  if you really like skiing, I don't know. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4439.28s)]
*  But not me personally, I'd be like, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4441.48s)]
*  no, don't put a ski area there. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4443.04s)]
*  Why would you want a ski area there? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4446.36s)]
*  You know, why wouldn't you just wanna hike [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4448.24s)]
*  to the top of the mountain on your snowshoes, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4449.44s)]
*  you know, without the skier? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4452.84s)]
*  Have the skiers shut the lifts down for a while. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4455.0s)]
*  Nothing against skiing, I love skiing. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4456.96s)]
*  I'm a good skier, I skied my whole life. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4458.96s)]
*  You know, I skied in Colorado, I love skiing. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4461.0s)]
*  So I'm not bashing ski areas, but it just, you know, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4462.8s)]
*  it's almost like enough's enough. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4466.4s)]
*  Try walk to the top of the mountain and ski down. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4468.64s)]
*  You know, then you've accomplished something. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4472.28s)]
*  Yeah, fewer runs that way. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4474.44s)]
*  Yeah, but you've accomplished something. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4476.0s)]
*  You've actually done something that day. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4477.56s)]
*  Hopping on the chairlift, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4479.12s)]
*  riding to the top and sliding down, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4480.04s)]
*  you haven't accomplished anything. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4481.2s)]
*  No, that's true. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4482.84s)]
*  You drove there in your car, you hopped on the chairlift, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4483.68s)]
*  you rode to the top of the mountain, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4485.52s)]
*  you slid down the other side on your skis. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4487.72s)]
*  You didn't do anything, you know? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4490.68s)]
*  Yeah, you've, you know, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4492.64s)]
*  you gotta be in good shape to ski. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4494.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's a young person sport, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4495.52s)]
*  or a person in good shape, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4498.12s)]
*  but you don't have to be in that good of shape. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4499.360000000001s)]
*  I can ski, I'm not in good shape. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4501.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's just, I don't know. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4504.04s)]
*  It just seemed like the wrong thing to do. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4505.400000000001s)]
*  Then you see the development around any resort, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4508.6s)]
*  whether it's a ski area or a golf course, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4511.72s)]
*  or you can't think of any other kind of resorts [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4514.2s)]
*  that they have. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4517.8s)]
*  Really, that's about it, I guess. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4519.0s)]
*  The development around them is the big thing. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4520.92s)]
*  You know, look at the housing developments [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4524.0s)]
*  and the condos and another mountain bulldoze over here, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4525.96s)]
*  so these people can look at that ski area. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4529.099999999999s)]
*  You know, oh, I want a view of the ski area. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4532.32s)]
*  I mean, that's personal preference. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4534.5599999999995s)]
*  That's not, I'm not putting those people down. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4535.96s)]
*  Just, it doesn't, nature-wise and environmentally, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4538.36s)]
*  environmentally, it certainly doesn't [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4542.8s)]
*  sound like a good idea. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4545.0s)]
*  I don't think you need much environmental education [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4546.0s)]
*  to figure out that it's not good. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4548.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4550.04s)]
*  You know, I think eighth grade earth science [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4550.88s)]
*  would tell you that that's not a good thing to do. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4552.44s)]
*  Like, you know, paving a road to the top of the mountain [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4556.36s)]
*  so you can have views, but it's been like that [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4558.6s)]
*  in Europe for a long time, right? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4561.36s)]
*  There's a lot of that in Europe, right? [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4562.64s)]
*  Ski areas and development. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4564.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4566.48s)]
*  So, and it's been fine over there. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4567.32s)]
*  I mean, mother nature does heal itself around those things. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4569.28s)]
*  So it's probably not long-term that big a deal [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4573.44s)]
*  for the environment. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4577.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4578.44s)]
*  It just seems like a short-term thing to me. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4579.28s)]
*  If we have a massive economic downturn, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4580.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, a lot of this stuff will heal itself, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4583.759999999999s)]
*  as you said, anyway. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4586.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think, yeah, if those houses get abandoned, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4588.759999999999s)]
*  you've seen abandoned towns. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4591.639999999999s)]
*  I looked up the post that I was stationed at in Germany [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4593.799999999999s)]
*  and it was, you know, abandoned. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4597.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know what they use it for now, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4600.44s)]
*  but basically abandoned. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4601.5199999999995s)]
*  They were like stucco German, stucco type buildings [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4602.76s)]
*  like you see in Germany. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4606.04s)]
*  And it was like the, it's like gone. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4607.160000000001s)]
*  Like the earth had already swallowed up all those buildings. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4610.76s)]
*  Really? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4613.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it was like everything's falling down. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4614.320000000001s)]
*  The grass is growing, trees growing up through everything. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4615.84s)]
*  You know, just like when you find old logging camp [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4618.64s)]
*  in the woods, you'll find the stove and the- [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4620.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4622.160000000001s)]
*  All the stuff and the tree growing up through everything. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4623.0s)]
*  Find a stone wall in a cellar hole. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4626.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a stone wall in a cellar hole [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4627.6s)]
*  with a 200 year old tree in the middle of it. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4628.88s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4631.68s)]
*  I think Mother Nature will recover. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4633.52s)]
*  It's just an aesthetic thing for me, I would say. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4635.84s)]
*  You know, I don't like the washouts, though, the erosion. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4638.8s)]
*  I don't like building, you know, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4641.52s)]
*  you shouldn't be building roads up mountains anyway. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4643.320000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you have to to get to the next town [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4645.240000000001s)]
*  or economic reasons or, but yeah, just for recreation, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4647.56s)]
*  build a road up the side of a mountain [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4652.8s)]
*  that causes a shitload of erosion. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4654.56s)]
*  No, that's not a good idea. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4656.080000000001s)]
*  I did that kind of work too. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4658.160000000001s)]
*  I did that for years and I, oh my, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4659.240000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't have what I have right now [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4661.2s)]
*  if it wasn't for the ski area. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4662.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, I worked up there for doing landscaping [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4664.36s)]
*  and carpentry and stuff for years, excavation. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4667.24s)]
*  So I feel bad bashing it, but it'd be like, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4669.44s)]
*  if you worked for a company that installed windmills [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4673.599999999999s)]
*  and you made a lot of money doing it, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4675.76s)]
*  say you were a truck driver for the company [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4677.84s)]
*  that put in windmills, I mean, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4680.16s)]
*  you can still hate windmills, right? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4682.0s)]
*  And still enjoy your job. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4684.0s)]
*  I don't know, I can't relate. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4685.24s)]
*  I mean, it's not like I worked for media companies [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4686.5199999999995s)]
*  that lied to the population of the country I was born in. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4688.36s)]
*  Like justified pointless wars through fear. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4691.68s)]
*  But you still love those media companies. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4696.16s)]
*  Oh, I love them. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4697.44s)]
*  I don't judge at all. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4698.84s)]
*  Right, yeah, so we all get stuck in the hypocrisy of, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4699.92s)]
*  you know, nobody's above hypocrisy, that's for sure. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4705.48s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4707.72s)]
*  You know, we all get stuck, you know, the guy that, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4708.72s)]
*  but then you see the people that go skiing with the, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4711.28s)]
*  the Subaru and the Save the Planet Earth sticker, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4716.08s)]
*  but they're heading up to go skiing. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4718.52s)]
*  Now that bothers me. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4719.88s)]
*  You know, that's blatant hypocrisy there. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4722.6s)]
*  And they'll say, oh, there's solar panels [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4726.96s)]
*  on the side of the, on the chairlift. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4728.4800000000005s)]
*  So the chairlift solar powered, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4730.88s)]
*  they should know better than that. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4732.24s)]
*  The solar panel on the building going into the chairlift, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4734.2s)]
*  it might power the guy's coffee pot at best. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4736.92s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4739.52s)]
*  You know, it's not, they should know better than that. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4740.64s)]
*  I don't think. And it's our fault for letting, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4743.68s)]
*  it's not, those people have very good intentions. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4745.0s)]
*  All the, we call, I call them moon bats. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4748.84s)]
*  All the moon bat people, you know who I'm talking about. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4751.32s)]
*  I do. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4753.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, you know, but I'm not putting them down. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4754.32s)]
*  They have the best intentions in the world. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4756.360000000001s)]
*  They really honestly think that what they're doing is great. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4758.76s)]
*  I think they do feel deep down inside [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4763.56s)]
*  because they're not, those people aren't getting rich off it. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4765.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4767.92s)]
*  You know, it's the politicians, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4768.76s)]
*  it's the politicians that are getting rich off it. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4769.84s)]
*  But those people are just kind of blind and naive. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4772.360000000001s)]
*  And they really do believe that what they're fighting for [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4776.28s)]
*  is true. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4780.719999999999s)]
*  And it's not their fault that they're in charge now. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4783.04s)]
*  You look at all the moon bats, you got people, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4786.5199999999995s)]
*  you got a woman running for president right now [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4788.96s)]
*  that is not qualified to teach finger painting [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4790.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4795.2s)]
*  I mean, it's your fault and my fault that she's in charge. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4796.04s)]
*  It's his fault that she's in charge. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4800.48s)]
*  It's not the rest of the moon bats people in charge. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4802.08s)]
*  We let that happen. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4804.88s)]

*  We let those people take over. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4813.52s)]
*  I mean, we tried our best to stop it, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4815.04s)]
*  but we didn't do good enough. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4816.84s)]

*  I don't even know if they're qualified for that [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4973.0s)]
*  because that's how they, you know, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4974.56s)]
*  what do you do with those people [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4977.0s)]
*  that wanna let 14 year old kids get sex changes? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4978.12s)]

*  What would you do? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4986.36s)]
*  I'm not religious at all, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4987.2s)]
*  but that's definitely the mark of the devil [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4988.04s)]
*  or the whatever they call it. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4991.36s)]
*  What would you do with them? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4994.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4996.04s)]
*  I mean, you've supervised a lot. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4997.6s)]
*  There's a lot of them [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=4999.44s)]
*  and there's a lot of people giving into it. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5000.28s)]
*  Like people that you would never suspect giving into that. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5001.68s)]
*  Well, it's not that bad. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5004.16s)]
*  So what the drag queen story hour in kindergarten, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5005.28s)]
*  what does a kindergarten kid know? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5009.16s)]
*  No, it's pretty bad. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5010.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't care if a transgender person reads a story [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5012.44s)]
*  to my kid, they can babysit my kid. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5015.12s)]
*  I don't care if they're transgender, that's fine, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5016.599999999999s)]
*  but the way that they act with the boobs hanging out [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5018.4s)]
*  and the sexualized dancing and all that. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5021.4s)]
*  No, I don't care what gender you are. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5025.16s)]
*  It's got nothing to do with transgender. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5026.8s)]
*  You don't act that way around kids or, you know, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5028.08s)]
*  I don't go around, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5032.16s)]
*  I'm not gonna go have a, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5033.32s)]
*  it's the doggy style society people. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5035.48s)]
*  We're gonna have a parade. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5037.88s)]
*  All the people that like to do it doggy style, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5039.4s)]
*  we're just gonna have a parade. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5041.2s)]
*  That'd be most people. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5042.28s)]
*  You know, we're not gonna do that. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5043.4s)]
*  You don't do those kinds of, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5046.36s)]
*  you don't do a transgender sexual parade. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5047.5199999999995s)]
*  I've always thought that that would be the trigger [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5051.16s)]
*  for violence, because someone got, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5053.0s)]
*  did that shit to my kids, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5054.2s)]
*  I shoot them without thinking about it. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5055.04s)]
*  I think it's gonna come to that. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5055.88s)]
*  I think it's pretty- [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5057.04s)]
*  Well, that's so ridiculous. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5057.88s)]
*  Like if someone, that's like, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5059.28s)]
*  that's a form of sexual abuse on my kids. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5061.4s)]
*  So that's the one thing you can't allow. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5064.12s)]
*  You get beat up in the old days for doing that. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5066.12s)]
*  At very least, at very least beaten up. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5067.92s)]
*  So, and I'm utterly opposed to violence, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5070.16s)]
*  as I often say, and you know me well, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5072.88s)]
*  you know that I actually am opposed to violence. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5074.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not just saying I hate these wars. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5076.48s)]
*  I hate all this shit. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5078.24s)]
*  But if there's one excuse for violence, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5079.839999999999s)]
*  it's sexually abusing my children, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5082.5599999999995s)]
*  or I'm not a good dad if I'm allowing that. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5084.759999999999s)]
*  And all these people are allowing it. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5087.48s)]
*  It's like, what's wrong with you? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5088.88s)]
*  For real. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5091.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5092.4s)]
*  What is wrong with people? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5093.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's, how did it, that, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5095.16s)]
*  and people are giving, the good people are giving up. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5098.0s)]
*  They're just saying, well, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5100.32s)]
*  I don't know if it's they don't wanna, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5101.5599999999995s)]
*  I've heard people say like, you know, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5104.0s)]
*  how can you let your kids do that? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5105.44s)]
*  Well, all the rest of the kids are doing it, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5106.719999999999s)]
*  and they're all talking about that. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5108.759999999999s)]
*  And there are certain things that kids do [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5110.92s)]
*  that you like, you scold your kid for it, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5113.24s)]
*  but okay, all kids are gonna do that. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5115.88s)]
*  They're gonna steal your Playboy magazine, you know. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5117.44s)]
*  They're gonna look at stuff like that, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5119.92s)]
*  that's just, you punish them for it. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5122.16s)]
*  But I think that they wanna fit in. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5124.2s)]
*  Like, I think there might be so many [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5127.719999999999s)]
*  of those type of people now [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5129.32s)]
*  that the people don't wanna lose their family members. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5130.48s)]
*  Well, that is true. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5133.92s)]
*  You know, so they don't wanna come disconnected [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5134.96s)]
*  with their family, cause they love their family. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5137.2s)]
*  So like, okay, I'm, there's five people in the family [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5139.36s)]
*  that think the way I do, so-called normal thinking. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5142.719999999999s)]
*  And then the rest of them think it's okay [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5146.8s)]
*  to get gender surgery at 14 years old. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5148.96s)]
*  You know, you're outnumbered in your family. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5154.92s)]
*  I think the college has brainwashed those. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5157.6s)]
*  You think it comes from colleges? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5159.28s)]
*  I think it does. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5160.64s)]
*  I don't know, when you were at Harvard, was it crazy? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5162.28s)]
*  I went to college for a year. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5164.96s)]
*  For what? [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5166.72s)]
*  I went to study forestry, I didn't do too good. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5167.56s)]
*  I was young and- [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5170.08s)]
*  Forestry. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5171.4s)]

*  I mean, I did good in school, I was fine. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5173.28s)]
*  I just didn't like going to college. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5175.08s)]
*  I didn't, I don't know, I didn't fit in. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5176.44s)]
*  I drank back then, partying young, you know, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5181.2s)]
*  that kind of stuff. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5183.5599999999995s)]
*  So, you know, didn't, and I was working too. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5184.4s)]
*  I enjoyed working. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5186.759999999999s)]
*  When I went to college, I worked [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5187.839999999999s)]
*  for the logging company in town and I enjoyed it. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5189.24s)]

*  I really, I really enjoyed it. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5202.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I didn't do, I didn't, I had a lady, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5204.44s)]
*  what was she, a English teacher, I believe. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5208.879999999999s)]

*  but I, sociology, and I did a report on John Wayne [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5217.24s)]
*  or John Wayne movies. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5223.24s)]
*  We had to be real fancy about, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5224.32s)]
*  but I used John Wayne movies as my base. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5226.599999999999s)]
*  And I said, how great John Wayne was. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5228.759999999999s)]
*  Everybody loves John Wayne. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5230.16s)]
*  Who doesn't like John Wayne? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5231.16s)]
*  In front of the class, she did a thing [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5233.32s)]
*  on how John Wayne was a racist. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5236.16s)]
*  And I'm looking at her and I'm like, what? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5238.76s)]

*  She goes, oh yeah, it's, you know, it's proven. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5254.44s)]
*  And then she gives me all this stuff [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5257.72s)]
*  that probably came from the 70s or 60s, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5258.96s)]
*  all this data about, you know, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5262.96s)]
*  how those kinds of movies in Hollywood [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5265.2s)]
*  was racist in the old days. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5266.8s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5268.32s)]
*  I've lived with, you know, people of all color. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5270.12s)]
*  I never got the idea that John Wayne was a racist [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5272.92s)]
*  or was racist or watching a John Wayne movie was racist. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5276.12s)]
*  Or, you know, I used to, I had, you know, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5279.4800000000005s)]
*  people of color, my roommates in the service [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5284.9800000000005s)]
*  and we would sit around and watch John Wayne movies. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5287.28s)]
*  You know, and nobody ever- [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5289.4800000000005s)]
*  They didn't walk out in outrage. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5290.56s)]
*  They didn't walk out in outrage, you know, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5291.68s)]
*  so I don't know what those, so then I was like, okay, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5293.0s)]
*  this is what's going on here. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5295.080000000001s)]
*  You know, and she wanted me to print all my stuff on, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5297.52s)]
*  I worked at the time. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5300.400000000001s)]
*  She wanted me to, I was probably just being a smart ass [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5301.4800000000005s)]
*  for this cause I can be a smart ass sometimes. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5304.92s)]
*  She wanted me to print all the stuff. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5307.8s)]
*  Computers were just coming out like, I don't know, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5309.400000000001s)]
*  word processor type things. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5312.4400000000005s)]
*  So you had to put everything on a disc [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5313.8s)]
*  and that's how she wanted you to hand in your sign. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5315.320000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure she was trying to teach you [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5317.240000000001s)]
*  how to learn computers too. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5318.400000000001s)]
*  That was probably part of the deal. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5319.48s)]
*  I didn't have a computer and I had to work a lot. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5321.4s)]
*  You know, I didn't have time to stay at school [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5324.679999999999s)]
*  and use a computer. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5326.32s)]
*  I would just type the stuff out at night [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5327.2s)]
*  and I didn't own a computer. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5329.2s)]
*  So she said, well, you have to turn it on the disc. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5331.5199999999995s)]
*  I said, I'd love to. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5333.28s)]
*  I said, I don't have a computer. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5334.4s)]
*  I don't have time. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5335.36s)]
*  She goes, well, there's plenty of computers in the library. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5336.58s)]
*  I said, I don't have time to stay and do that. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5338.639999999999s)]
*  When I leave here, I go to work [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5340.4s)]
*  and then I do my stuff at night. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5341.679999999999s)]
*  And then I saw she, I went to the dean [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5344.879999999999s)]
*  and there wasn't the dean. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5348.12s)]
*  Might've been the dean. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5349.5599999999995s)]
*  It was a small college anyway. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5350.4s)]
*  And I explained it to him and he goes, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5352.08s)]
*  well, yeah, I said, I'm paying you guys. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5355.599999999999s)]
*  Like you guys work for me. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5358.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, you're my employee. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5361.84s)]
*  And he didn't, the dean was pretty good about that [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5364.5199999999995s)]
*  but that woman was mad. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5367.16s)]
*  That teacher was mad. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5368.7s)]
*  Like, no, you guys work for me. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5370.32s)]
*  I'm paying, you know, it's like, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5371.8s)]
*  when you go to college, it's just like you're paying [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5374.28s)]
*  that professor to mow your lawn. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5377.06s)]
*  That professor works for you. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5378.42s)]
*  Of course. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5379.740000000001s)]
*  You know, you don't work for them, you know? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5380.660000000001s)]
*  So she, and the dean said, it's okay. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5384.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, he can hand his stuff. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5387.1s)]
*  He took my side because I was working [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5388.34s)]
*  and I was paying tuition. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5390.54s)]
*  It was GI bill, but I was still right, you know, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5393.06s)]
*  I still wrote the check and the check came to me. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5395.860000000001s)]
*  And so he was, and that woman did not see it that way. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5399.06s)]
*  The job of this racist lady. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5402.02s)]
*  She did not see the fact that she works for me. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5403.54s)]
*  She did not get that correlation, I guess. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5405.5s)]
*  I would have whip up some dinner and pressure wash the deck. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5408.22s)]
*  Yeah, change the oil and rotate the tires on my truck. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5411.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5414.82s)]
*  Patrick Feeney, thank you. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5417.42s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5418.46s)]
*  It was a pleasure. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5419.3s)]
*  It was. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5420.3s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5425.14s)]
*  I know. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5429.3s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5430.14s)]
*  with everything at stake, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5432.74s)]
*  Google would be putting its thumb on the scale [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5433.98s)]
*  and preventing you from hearing anything [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5436.7s)]
*  that the people in charge don't want you to hear. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5439.9s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5441.58s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5443.139999999999s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5444.0199999999995s)]
*  but that's a waste of time. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5445.7s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5446.94s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5448.299999999999s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information that's true. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5450.0599999999995s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5454.0599999999995s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5456.0599999999995s)]
*  is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5458.099999999999s)]
*  Subscribe and you'll have a much higher chance [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5460.0599999999995s)]
*  of hearing what we say, and we hope you will. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SejsFCUWf4&t=5463.94s)]
