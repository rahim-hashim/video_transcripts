# Maxime Bernier: Trump’s Tariffs, Mass Immigration, and the Oncoming Canadian Revolution
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c)
*  Now that Trudeau is gone or sort of gone like what was that who was he working for actually? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=0.0s)]
*  I can tell you talker. He was not working for us for Canadians. He did destroy our country economically [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4.8s)]
*  socially and culturally [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  You know [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=15.32s)]
*  What he did to us during COVID-19? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=16.92s)]
*  That was an authoritarian government. I don't know if you remember that but I did an interview with you after very well [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=19.6s)]
*  Yeah, I was handcuffed and put in jail for a known crime just in the summer of 2021 [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=26.0s)]
*  Because I was speaking about freedom in a park in Manitoba [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=33.36s)]
*  And [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=56.56s)]
*  He did impose on us also a vaccine passport [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=58.28s)]
*  I wasn't able to travel across the country because I'm not vaccine, you know [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=61.64s)]
*  But what what he did to our country? Do you regret not being vaxxed? Oh, no [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=66.38s)]
*  Do you ever think I really wish I'd had the COVID vaccine? No, no [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=71.44s)]
*  That was the best decision in my life [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=76.48s)]
*  Sorry not to make others feel better [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=80.32s)]
*  So he went about it so systematically he [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  Got the government to pay for killing your citizens through the maids program like everything he did seemed designed to destroy Canada [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=86.52s)]
*  Like on purpose if you want to destroy the country you would do what he did. Why do you think he did that? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  You know, he is a socialist for sure and a globalist [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=99.56s)]
*  You know and the world economic forum for him was you know, the great thing, you know [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=104.16s)]
*  And they were promoting socialism and globalism and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=110.4s)]
*  Nobody imposed that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=114.52s)]
*  philosophy on us on Canadians [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=116.8s)]
*  Trudeau was very pleased with that and he decided to put legislation in into place into force in Canada [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=118.56s)]
*  In line with that philosophy and you know for him he was spending money [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=125.72s)]
*  like, you know, like it was [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=131.76s)]
*  It was you know [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=135.36s)]
*  Not a big deal actually what he did he was able to double [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=137.16s)]
*  The debt that we accumulated over 148 years [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  He was able to double that in ten years [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=147.6s)]
*  So our debt went doubled the debt in ten years the debt that we accumulated [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=151.36s)]
*  Over 148 years. It took him ten years to do that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=156.36s)]
*  So we the debt was six hundred billion dollars and he doubled that to twelve hundred billion dollars and he said [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=160.64s)]
*  You know [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=169.0s)]
*  Deficits are okay when you have a deficit, you know, it's a way to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=170.0s)]
*  Stimulate the economy, but we know that you know, you cannot stimulate the economy with borrowed money [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a sedative for the economy. So now in Canada [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=180.83999999999997s)]
*  We are in I believe in a recession our standard of living is going down [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=184.56s)]
*  Actually what he did with mass immigration [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=189.44s)]
*  That was you know, his dad [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=192.88s)]
*  Was a big [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=196.16s)]
*  Proponent of multiculturalism, you know every culture are equal. So and he did that in the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=198.28s)]
*  1970s that philosophy and now we have a legislation in Canada promoting multiculturalism [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=207.92s)]
*  But add that with mass immigration [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=213.48s)]
*  You have the perfect storm you have people who are coming to our country and you don't ask them to integrate into our [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=217.08s)]
*  Society you can keep your culture you you know don't integrate into our society [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  Live in a ghettos and we have ghettos in Canada also. So a lot of people came to Canada [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=229.96s)]
*  And you know the economy was growing because of the growth of the population [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=237.84s)]
*  But you know the population was growing faster than the economy so our GDP per capita went down the last ten years [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=243.6s)]
*  So we are poor today in Canada [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=250.8s)]
*  If you look at what what we had ten years ago and it's because of Trudeau. It's because of massive immigration [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  It's because of big spendings [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=259.8s)]
*  That's the that's the legacy of Justin Trudeau tens of thousands of Canadians killed themselves during his time [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=262.36s)]
*  I mean if there's one measure of happiness, it's like you don't kill yourself [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=269.76000000000005s)]
*  So if you have Canadians killing themselves tens of thousands of them then that so my question is why isn't he in jail? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  And we're all excited to send all these people to jail Andrew Tate must go to jail [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=280.12s)]
*  But like I don't understand why Justin Trudeau is not in jail for destroying an entire [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=283.48s)]
*  But the good news right now is not in government anymore, but we still have the liberals [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=289.16s)]
*  But we need to have a real inquiry about everything that happened during COVID-19 [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=293.72s)]
*  These people must be responsible and you're right and now they are not it's like [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=298.4s)]
*  They want to turn the page about what they did to us [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  During the COVID hysteria for them, you know, that was okay. That was not okay. We had a Charter of Rights [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=308.24s)]
*  They did not respect our Charter of Rights and you know, look at the freedom convoy [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=315.12s)]
*  The freedom convoy for me that was not a protest. That was a celebration of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  Who we are as a Canadian, yes decided okay now we will end that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  authoritarian government [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  peacefully and what Trudeau did he invoked the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=336.32s)]
*  The Emergencies Act. Yes, that's an act that he used in times of war [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=341.2s)]
*  against us against freedom fighters and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=347.64s)]
*  You know, but at the end we were successful because you know couple of months after that freedom convoy all these [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=351.04s)]
*  authoritarian measures [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=358.76s)]
*  You know they disappeared and they were these politicians were not saying it's because of the freedom convoy [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=360.12s)]
*  but it was because of the freedom convoy people were fed up at that time and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=366.24s)]
*  you know, but I [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=371.32s)]
*  Cannot I cannot understand why? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=374.0s)]
*  Everybody's saying in Canada, that's okay. Just forget that forget what happened to you during COVID-19 [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=376.76s)]
*  You know, we need to we needed to do that because to protect yourself [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=383.16s)]
*  But we know that that vaccine was not safe and effective and we are still promoting the MRNA [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=387.48s)]
*  Vaccine in Canada right now we're doing in the United States to and I don't understand why yeah and our proposal on that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=394.0s)]
*  It's a moratorium. We want a moratorium on immigration a pause on immigration [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=400.2s)]
*  No more immigrants for a couple of years until we fix the problem of mass immigration and also a moratorium on these [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  MRNA vaccine we would like that too. You never kind of get what you really want. Do you yeah? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, you need you need to fight for that you need to fight for that. So what is Trudeau doing? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=416.44000000000005s)]
*  I mean, there are many people responsible [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  I would say I actually am one of the only Americans who's interested in Canada and really loves Canada [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  Because I live near Canada but and so I've followed it and I think there are a number of people [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  Not just in Trudeau's party, but in the in his coalition party who are responsible, but he's the most responsible [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  So what is he doing now? I don't know. I don't know. I don't want to know talker [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  He just gets to like walk around Canada free. Oh, he's still free [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  I put people in prison for opposing him, but I can tell you he needs a lot of security [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=449.52s)]
*  I bet he does. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you know [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=455.24s)]
*  Look [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=457.24s)]
*  We are fed up with the liberals and right now in in that electoral campaign [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=459.24s)]
*  It's all about there's only one subject now [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=464.0s)]
*  It's not you know, I wanted to add that this election to be on mass immigration. That must be the most important [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=467.08s)]
*  It is destroying our way of life [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=473.76s)]
*  You know and when I'm speaking about mass immigration people are not going to be able to do that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=475.76s)]
*  We have life [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=480.72s)]
*  You know and when I'm speaking about mass immigration people don't understand that last year in Canada [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=481.88000000000005s)]
*  We had 1.3 million foreigners coming to our country for a country of 40 million people [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=488.20000000000005s)]
*  that is mass immigration and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=494.56s)]
*  Well, that's an invasion. Yeah [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=496.72s)]
*  97% of the growth of our population last year was coming from mass immigration. This is [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=499.92s)]
*  the replacement [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=507.76000000000005s)]
*  Theory but it was not a theory. It's a reality. It's in the Canadian population like the American population the European population [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=509.92s)]
*  replaced [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=517.68s)]
*  That's what is happening in our country right now [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=518.88s)]
*  And you know the immigrants that are coming here the foreigners that are coming to Canada, you know are coming from countries [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=521.12s)]
*  That doesn't share our Western civilization values [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=529.6s)]
*  So it's more difficult for them and they don't speak English or they don't speak French [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=533.16s)]
*  They cannot integrate into our society. That's a big problem [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=537.6s)]
*  That's a huge problem. And now you have the housing crisis because of that too many people all these [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=541.52s)]
*  People need a roof. So but but the solution is, you know, it's question of supply and demand [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=548.72s)]
*  You just have to stop the demand and that will solve the housing crisis [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=554.9200000000001s)]
*  But you know poly air the leader of the conservative party like the Republican Party here in Canada in the US [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=558.96s)]
*  But they're not conservative they're conservative in name only [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=565.64s)]
*  Like, you know the pierre poliev pierre poliev is the leader of the conservative party [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=569.64s)]
*  He seems like a true fraud to me like a pretty sinister fraud [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=573.96s)]
*  But you know, he's doing a campaign against trump. They don't want to do a campaign to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=577.4s)]
*  Help Canadians and put our country first now. It's all about oh the tariffs and you know, we need to do counter tariffs [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=582.6s)]
*  But that's killing us [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=590.52s)]
*  Because how about stopping immigration from India and Pakistan? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=592.2s)]
*  First please yes first that that's but that's not even a consideration because no they are pandering [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=595.24s)]
*  They are pandering they [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=600.44s)]
*  the liberals and the conservatives are pandering to these ethnic communities for votes, so [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=602.44s)]
*  That's why they don't speak about ending mass immigration [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=609.1600000000001s)]
*  Actually poly have said we need to have two hundred and fifty thousand [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=612.2800000000001s)]
*  foreigners a year plus [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=616.6800000000001s)]
*  international students plus [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=619.22s)]
*  Temporary foreign workers plus refugees that would be about 1.5 million foreigners over three years [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=621.62s)]
*  That is mass immigration in the middle of a mass immigration crisis [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=628.9s)]
*  We cannot afford that we cannot that's this so can I say like again just to the question I asked about Trudeau [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=633.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna ask the same about poly of like who's paying him to do that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=640.34s)]
*  That's not I mean no one's benefiting maybe maybe people from bungalow. Yes for benefiting. Okay, i'm not against them by the way [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=644.58s)]
*  I understand i'd move to canada too if I lived in bangladesh, but [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=651.3000000000001s)]
*  No one in canada is benefiting from this. So why would poly of and trudeau be embracing the same? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=654.9s)]
*  Policy that everyone hates and is destroying canada. Yeah, you have a point there 70 percent of the population in canada [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=661.5400000000001s)]
*  the last survey are saying [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=669.3000000000001s)]
*  No to mass immigration. We must end mass immigration. So your question is if these politicians [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=672.5s)]
*  Want to be elected how come they are not listening to the population exactly because [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=678.84s)]
*  They are, you know, there's 343 writings in canada and that's a parliamentary system [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=685.16s)]
*  So they're looking at different writings and they want to have support in different writings to be able to have a majority [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=691.16s)]
*  But in a lot of writings, there's a majority of foreigners or immigrants and they want to have their support [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=696.92s)]
*  But the new immigrants so they are asking for having their family here in canada with them when i'm speaking about family [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=704.44s)]
*  It's not the immediate family [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=711.8000000000001s)]
*  mother father and and children no it is you know, your uncle your grandma granddad [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=713.88s)]
*  brothers sisters so that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  The entire family and they want them here in canada. So they are saying okay [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=724.0400000000001s)]
*  Reunification of family will do that for you. You'll be able to bring all your family here in canada [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=729.88s)]
*  so because of the [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=735.0s)]
*  Electoral system they're looking to win some writings to have a majority and that's why they are not speaking for canadians [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  They're speaking for different people in different writings. So we have a majority there [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=743.96s)]
*  So what you're really saying is that a democratic system does not produce democratic results [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=749.16s)]
*  We have these democratic systems throughout the west that have for 50 years done the opposite of what their populations want [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=754.6800000000001s)]
*  So it's it's a democratic system without democracy. That's the way it feels to me [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=761.88s)]
*  And when you have another point of view like us the people's party [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=767.08s)]
*  About that they try to cancel you they don't want you they don't you know, the mainstream media in canada [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=771.1600000000001s)]
*  They won't [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=777.24s)]
*  It's like I don't exist [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=778.44s)]
*  as a [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=780.44s)]
*  Populist party in canada [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=781.64s)]
*  So so they don't want our point of view to be out there [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=783.4s)]
*  So I need to do podcasts and you know being with you and traveling across the country and being my campaign on [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=786.84s)]
*  Doing my campaign on social media. That's the only way to be out there [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=794.36s)]
*  And they know if more people can understand our position we will have more support, but they don't want that [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=799.0s)]
*  You know all these they're globalists [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=805.72s)]
*  The the the i'm the only one who's fighting for the sovereignty of our country [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=807.72s)]
*  For them, you know more people would be okay [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=812.52s)]
*  And for me, let's just have that pause, you know, we're destroying our country really globalists [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=815.24s)]
*  Are they because they're not doing this to china and africa in the middle east? They're not saying [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=820.76s)]
*  Those nations need to invite a lot of people from different parts of the world. They're it's not actually global [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=826.0400000000001s)]
*  It's only one side. It's anti-western. Yes, they're saying that there's something about [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=831.0s)]
*  A majority white christian country that's inherently threatening and we're going to destroy it and that's kind of not kind of it is exactly [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=835.4799999999999s)]
*  What they've done and around the world [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=841.3199999999999s)]
*  They did that in france in uk in germany and now in canada. Yes, you've got basically russia [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=845.0s)]
*  Left and of course, that's the country they hate most so it is a tell like they're not [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=851.3199999999999s)]
*  Screaming at chairman shi to let in a bunch of people from nigeria. It's like not even on the table [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=855.9599999999999s)]
*  They're not even demanding japan do that. It's just canada uk western europe australia new zealand in the us and that's it [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=860.76s)]
*  That's it. And and what they're doing, you know, if you are a leader of a nation [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=867.4s)]
*  Your first responsibility is to work for your people [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=872.36s)]
*  And it's immoral what they're doing right now because they're helping foreigners more than canadians. Of course [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=876.12s)]
*  What what party have the leader of the conservative party of canada and carney the leader of the liberal party of canada? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=882.52s)]
*  They're saying on mass immigration. We will solve that we will build more houses for them [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=889.4s)]
*  So what they're doing they want more foreigners and that's why they're building more houses [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=894.3599999999999s)]
*  But that's not to solve the housing crisis for canadians. No, that's you know [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=899.8s)]
*  They are putting their energy to be sure that foreigners will come to our country and they will have a roof [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=905.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm saying no just stop that please let's work for our people first [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=912.1999999999999s)]
*  But why do they hate I mean look in the end you understand motive by action like [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=916.36s)]
*  How does someone feel? I don't know. Let's watch what he does [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=921.48s)]
*  Yeah, so if you deny your children food, you probably hate your children. You can say whatever [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=924.68s)]
*  I love my children, but if you're not giving them dinner you hate them [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=929.0799999999999s)]
*  Why do and so they clearly paulieve and trudeau and carney? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=932.28s)]
*  really hate [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  Canadians, why is that why? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=937.9399999999999s)]
*  They what they like it's power it's it's you know [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=941.16s)]
*  I I wish I have the answer to that but they are telling you the opposite they're telling you that they love, you know [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=945.8s)]

*  Comrade trade war with us right now [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  Paulie and carney are saying to us canadians. We love you [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=958.5999999999999s)]
*  We love you so much canadians that what we will do [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=962.68s)]
*  We will impose counter tariffs because trump is bad president trump is very bad, you know [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=966.04s)]
*  And we want to keep our country united. We are a sovereign country. We love you [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=971.64s)]
*  We will impose a new tax on you [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=976.68s)]
*  25 on everything that you are importing from the u.s [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=978.98s)]
*  I told you the inflation is high in canada our standard of living is going down and they add to that a new tax [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=983.56s)]
*  25 and they're telling us it's because we love us [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=990.04s)]
*  They love us. Sorry, and so [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=994.1999999999999s)]
*  It's crazy [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=997.1600000000001s)]
*  And and you know, they're they're okay with that and the former prime minister of canada steven harper I was with him [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=998.2800000000001s)]
*  I was a conservative before I was elected for 13 years [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1004.84s)]
*  I was a minister of foreign affairs and an industry minister under the upper government [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1008.9200000000001s)]
*  I resigned and we created our the people's party in 2018 [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1014.2s)]
*  But harper just wrote a letter in the national post in canada three weeks ago, and he said [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1018.2s)]
*  We need to do that trade war with us dollar for dollar [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1025.64s)]
*  And you know, you're 10 times bigger than us. We won't win a trade war against the u.s [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1030.6s)]
*  That's true and he said dollar for dollar and he said yes, it will hurt us canadians and yes [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1035.64s)]
*  We may start a recession, but that's okay [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1042.36s)]
*  So what i'm telling canadians no counter tariffs [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1046.68s)]
*  It's a tax that you impose on canadians and canadian businesses you must stop that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1050.6s)]
*  We must have a deal with president trump as soon as possible [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1055.9599999999998s)]
*  And we are able to do that if we put everything on the table, but for carney and poliev [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1060.1999999999998s)]
*  No, that's okay. And actually last week about these tariffs [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1065.9599999999998s)]
*  carney said okay, we will impose another tariffs, uh on the [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1071.08s)]
*  car imported from the u.s [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1076.4399999999998s)]
*  And he said the government will be able to raise eight billion dollars [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1079.0800000000002s)]
*  And we will give that to big corporations because they are affected by these tariffs [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1084.2s)]
*  They cannot export their products to the u.s [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1089.64s)]
*  So what is telling us? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1092.3600000000001s)]
*  I will take eight billion dollars for the poor consumers with that new tax you canadians consumers [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1094.1200000000001s)]
*  You will pay that and I will give that to big corporation [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1101.8s)]
*  Taxing the poor and giving that to the rich that that is the policy of the liberal government and [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1105.02s)]
*  Poliev is okay with that [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1112.1999999999998s)]
*  That's crazy [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1114.4599999999998s)]
*  And that is killing our economy [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1115.7399999999998s)]
*  Why would a government spy on its own citizens? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1117.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, of course because it doesn't trust its own citizens because it's afraid of its own citizens [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1120.54s)]

*  So but the new way of doing politics trump did it president trump did it and you know was successful [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1838.0s)]
*  You need to have a discussion and explain your point of view and your political [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1844.6399999999999s)]

*  and actually look at that I was supposed I did participated in the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1865.76s)]
*  The leaders debate in 2019. We created that party in 2018 [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1871.44s)]

*  But in 2021 [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1884.32s)]
*  They created a new rule and they said okay bernie now you don't have the right [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1886.6399999999999s)]
*  And that commission that leaders debate commission [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1891.52s)]
*  It's only to exclude they exist only to exclude the people's party [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1895.28s)]
*  And at this election, I was supposed to be able to participate in the national debate [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1900.0s)]
*  That will be next week [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1905.52s)]
*  But they change the rules just to exclude us so that's not fair that process is not fair [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1907.92s)]
*  They're so afraid of our ideas. They don't want us to have any [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1914.6399999999999s)]

*  I know a lot of them. I have a lot of french canadian friends [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1953.44s)]
*  I live near french canada and I've always liked them [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1955.76s)]
*  And I have always defended them and I always liked them because they defended their own culture [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1958.72s)]
*  Yeah, and their own language a little hard to deal with, you know [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1963.2s)]
*  The rest of french always complain about them and their license plates in quebec and all that [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1965.76s)]
*  But I always thought when it came right down to it the french canadians would defend [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1969.52s)]
*  Their land their culture their language their history and they're doing that right are they I hope so [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1973.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they are doing that right now. Look at at the provincial level in quebec [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1980.16s)]
*  There's the parti québécois the separatist party and a young charismatic leader is the leader of that party [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1984.16s)]
*  And the election at the provincial level in quebec will be in 2026 [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1991.6799999999998s)]
*  And he's speaking about separation and separation is [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=1996.56s)]
*  Growing in the polls right now. Why because of trudeau because of mass immigration [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2000.8799999999999s)]
*  francophone are looking at it all these immigrants and foreigners that are coming to quebec and canada [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2006.08s)]
*  Who don't speak french? They cannot integrate in the francophone culture [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2011.28s)]
*  culture, yes, so so there's they don't like that so they're looking at the parti québécois [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2015.6799999999998s)]
*  And the parti québécois is winning in the polls right now [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2021.76s)]
*  And the leader said if i'm the new premier of quebec a year after my election [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2025.84s)]
*  I will do a referendum on the independence the sovereignty of quebec. So it's it's back now because of mass immigration and in alberta [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2031.1999999999998s)]
*  They are so mad about ottawa and you know, because they cannot export their natural resources with you know [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2039.76s)]
*  climate change [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2046.6399999999999s)]
*  Regulations against the whole oil and gas industry [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2048.64s)]
*  More more albertans are separatists now [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2052.4s)]
*  So i'm telling canadians we are the only hope for this country if we want to save this country [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2055.44s)]
*  The people's party is there because we will respect our constitution. We will have a radical decentralization [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2062.4s)]
*  Alberta will be able to do that. We won't participate in the paris accord [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2068.7799999999997s)]
*  We won't participate with these globalists at the un of the world economic forum or well-health organization [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2073.12s)]
*  So will be a real independent country, but ottawa will be a smaller government [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2079.76s)]
*  That will be only in charge of his constitution constitutional responsibilities and not interfering in provincial jurisdictions [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2085.36s)]
*  Now you have that separatist movement in alberta because of the federal government that is, you know telling albertans what to do [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2092.6400000000003s)]
*  And albertans don't like it and I understand that do you think there's a chance that alberta joins montana [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2100.48s)]
*  You know, they can stay in the country and I hope that they don't think on country if [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2108.24s)]
*  If the people's party [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2113.2s)]
*  Position is adopted in our country if we win because we will have a radical decentralization [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2115.58s)]
*  And I believed and will respect their jurisdiction provincial autonomy and I hope that they will stay if not [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2121.38s)]
*  They will want to be independent or they can be the first [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2128.48s)]
*  51st state I don't know [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2132.62s)]
*  but that being said my goal is to unite this country and with our policies we will but if we [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2134.4s)]
*  go with poliev or [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2142.0s)]
*  Or or carne [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2144.32s)]
*  That would be the end of this country in couple of years and actually preston manning [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2145.84s)]
*  Preston manning was the leader of the reform party in the 1980s [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2150.64s)]
*  And that at that time, you know west the western canadians were very mad at ottawa [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2155.86s)]
*  With trudeau and they had that regional political party [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2162.42s)]
*  The reform party and very successful and after that the reform party did merge with [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2166.58s)]
*  Canadian alliance and after that the conservative party of canada [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2172.9s)]
*  So the reform party does not exist anymore and and our platform [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2175.78s)]
*  It's about 90 of the reform more autonomy less government, you know fiscally responsible [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2180.5s)]
*  but preston manning said [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2187.06s)]
*  two days ago [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2189.38s)]
*  that you know [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2190.9s)]
*  Uh if if the nothing's changed in this country, it would be good for alberta to separate [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2192.42s)]
*  He's saying that as the former leader of a party [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2199.78s)]
*  Who try that party that tries to have? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2204.02s)]
*  Western back in canada, you know by by changing ottawa and that he was not successful and now he's saying to our britain's, you know [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2208.34s)]
*  Yeah separation. I'm okay with that if ottawa [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2216.74s)]
*  Doesn't do anything for us. That would be the only solution [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2221.14s)]
*  But we need and that's why for me personally I decided to jump into politics in 2006 [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2224.82s)]
*  To have a federal government that will respect our constitution that will be a smaller government that will have a real free markets [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2231.32s)]
*  But that is not happening now [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2238.5200000000004s)]
*  We're sure you've heard plenty of those free phone promises from america's biggest wireless carriers [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2240.2000000000003s)]
*  If those deals sound too good to be true, it's probably because they are very often too good to be true [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2245.4s)]
*  They come with layers of fine print requiring you to sign up for [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2249.7200000000003s)]

*  Well, it's just sad because you would go to canada. I've spent a lot of time there hunting and fishing [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2385.0s)]
*  And even the conservative canadians says, you know, we've got this great health care system and they were so proud of their health care system [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2389.56s)]
*  I mean they really were I remember very well 30 years ago. They would always tell you and they were a little bit [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2394.36s)]
*  Insecure and defend, you know, we're canada. We're real country [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2400.34s)]
*  They're always like that, but we have this great health care system and they really were proud I think [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2403.32s)]
*  Were they but that's not the case right now [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2407.48s)]
*  They were that's not the case right now because the way waiting lists for surgeries you can wait a year [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2409.4s)]
*  So and you know, we are spending a lot of money for health care and that's not functioning [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2415.48s)]
*  So, but do people feel like it's not working in canada? Yeah more people actually. Oh, yeah more people [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2421.16s)]
*  So they're ready. My position is for every [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2425.8s)]
*  canadian to have a [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2428.98s)]
*  An insurance everybody will have an insurance and they will be able to choose if they can go to a private hospital [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2431.32s)]
*  Or a public hospital like in sweden like in european countries. They're spending less on health care, but they're more effective [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2437.4s)]
*  For us, you know, we need to put more competition in the system [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2445.32s)]
*  So and that would be a mixed system we don't have that right now, you know [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2448.6800000000003s)]
*  There's in some provinces like in québec you can have, you know private clinics that can do some surgeries [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2452.84s)]
*  But you know all across the country we need to have more private delivery of [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2459.6400000000003s)]
*  Health care services and we don't have that and so more canadians now understand that and they're ready for that reform [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2465.0s)]
*  But establishment politicians won't speak about that because it's a taboo subject [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2472.1200000000003s)]
*  To ask for more private delivery of services [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2477.3199999999997s)]
*  But the system itself doesn't work very well, right? Doesn't work doesn't work [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2481.16s)]
*  Immigration must be putting huge strain on that system. That's why that's me on that system on [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2485.62s)]
*  our [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2491.4s)]

*  That must be the first [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2499.64s)]
*  Priority for us in canada and for the mainstream media the mainstream politician it is not [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2501.48s)]
*  We are, you know with the liberals we are going, you know [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2508.92s)]
*  Driving into a wall and with the conservative we are driving into a wall, but at a different speed [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2513.0s)]
*  That's that that's same same here [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2521.0s)]
*  um, i'm not a conspiracy person, but like if every [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2523.96s)]

*  Has the same outcome which is two parties that fundamentally agree on the big issues but pretend to hate each other [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2531.56s)]
*  While the real concerns of the population are ignored [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2538.6800000000003s)]
*  You gotta wonder like how did every country in the west wind up with the same fake system? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2542.04s)]
*  Like honestly, how did that happen? Yeah [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2547.0s)]
*  We must admit that the [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2550.6800000000003s)]
*  The the globalist organizations and the world economic front they they have huge influence [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2552.6800000000003s)]

*  They want to fix everything and you know a solution to every problem must be a governmental solution [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2575.48s)]
*  Must be a solution that is coming from the government, but the government is the problem [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2581.56s)]
*  We have too much government in our lives so so [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2586.84s)]
*  That that's a problem in western society right now mass immigration big government big deficit [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2591.4s)]
*  high inflation [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2597.96s)]

*  Do you have friends or family who've left canada? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2602.1200000000003s)]

*  Business people are saying, you know, I don't want to invest in canada right now [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2612.36s)]
*  There and our private investment is going down and you need investment for economic growth, of course [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2616.52s)]
*  So so yeah, some people are leaving the country, but my goal i'm telling them stay in canada do the fight with me [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2622.52s)]
*  Together we can do that fight, you know, we will win that battle of ideas [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2629.56s)]
*  We have the best ideas based on individual freedom personal responsibility respect small government [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2633.88s)]
*  We have faith in people we don't have faith in a big fat government [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2640.04s)]

*  And you know, that's the fight we need to win that fight [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2646.6s)]
*  Why did they take all your guns away? Oh trudeau did it and he was very successful to do it [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2650.2s)]
*  you know [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2656.68s)]
*  Trudeau doesn't want us to defend ourselves and that's why in our platform we have the [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2658.52s)]
*  The castell doctrine, you know, you must be able to have a gun [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2664.12s)]
*  You must be able to defend yourself and your property with that [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2668.12s)]
*  We need to change our criminal code for that and our position as a political party [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2672.2799999999997s)]
*  We will repeal every legislation that trudeau put in to be sure that he will eliminate all the guns [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2677.32s)]
*  But for him, you know [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2684.36s)]
*  And for the conservative also on guns [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2686.6s)]
*  They're dangerous people are are not responsible. They must not have guns [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2689.4s)]
*  So that's why we have very tough legislation on guns in canada [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2694.92s)]
*  I noticed and they don't respect property rights on gun, you know, the federal government can decide tomorrow [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2700.44s)]
*  And with a new regulation this gun is illegal and the rcmp or police will go and seize your gun [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2706.36s)]

*  You can be a soldier for us without being a canadian citizen. What? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2741.16s)]
*  Without being a canadian citizen you're a you're an immigrant you can be part you can participate in the canadian forces [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2747.48s)]
*  So you're not a citizen of canada, but they'll hand you an automatic weapon and defend our country that you don't know [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2756.52s)]
*  But a canadian citizen can't have a gun at home [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2762.52s)]
*  But they'll give some foreigner an automatic weapon a fully automatic. Yeah, very dangerous one. Yeah. Yeah, okay [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=2765.4s)]

*  And you know, he wants to make america great again. He's fighting for you guys for americans [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3357.2799999999997s)]
*  I want to do the same in canada. I'm fighting for canada and fighting for canadians. So it's okay to [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3363.12s)]
*  To want to have the manufacturing sector back in the us [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3370.3999999999996s)]
*  For us in canada, we just have to be more productive and lower taxes to businesses [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3374.56s)]
*  Having a more productive economy a real free trade across the country [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3380.48s)]
*  there's a way to do that for us to keep investment here in canada, but our our [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3384.0s)]
*  Policies are not efficient anymore and too many taxes too many regulations [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3390.4s)]
*  and so but what what president trump is doing [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3395.76s)]
*  The the real solution for that and the problem it's because of your daughter as you know talker [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3400.4s)]
*  The dollar is the world's world's reserve currency. Yes, and because of that you have the tripping dilemma [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3405.52s)]
*  So, you know your daughter is very strong and other countries need [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3412.88s)]
*  your daughter [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3417.92s)]
*  Because you know to for international transaction to buy oil and gas they need your dollars [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3419.68s)]
*  So you are exporting your dollars [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3425.92s)]
*  and you know your [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3428.7200000000003s)]
*  your exports [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3431.36s)]
*  exports are very [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3433.36s)]
*  Expensive and not competitive because your dollar is so strong exactly the demand for your dollar is very strong [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3435.66s)]
*  So and and your imports are very cheap [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3441.84s)]
*  so the way to solve that to be able to export is to end the [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3446.8s)]
*  The dollar as the world reserve currency, but that that will that would mean [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3452.0s)]
*  Means a very tough [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3457.7599999999998s)]
*  Transition yes it does with inflation all these dollars will come back to the u.s [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3459.98s)]
*  And that will create inflation [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3464.7999999999997s)]
*  so [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3466.7999999999997s)]
*  We need we need to end that, you know fiat currency and going back to a gold standard and that's why I believe you know [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3467.92s)]
*  Goals gold is coming to us right now [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3475.52s)]
*  Uh, and I think something will happen will have a monetary reset or something will happen and here in canada [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3478.64s)]
*  We are not in a good position because our central bank the bank of canada doesn't have any gold reserve [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3484.8799999999997s)]
*  So if we have a new monetary system, you have no gold reserves. No gold reserves. Why they sold all that [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3491.3599999999997s)]
*  We have sold your gold reserve. Oh, yeah, we have a lot of your treasuries, but we don't have any gold [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3498.0s)]
*  No, we are the only central [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3503.12s)]
*  Bank the only one in western western worlds who that doesn't have any gold [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3505.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't canada is a huge gold producer. Yes, at least at least we can produce gold [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3511.68s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of gold. Yeah, you have actually some of the deep [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3516.48s)]
*  I think you've got some of the deepest gold reserves in the canadian mint. Yeah, of course your your gold one ounce coins are [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3518.8799999999997s)]
*  Currency or an investment? Yeah [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3525.1s)]
*  Uh for people around the world that's interesting [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3527.44s)]
*  But our central our central bank doesn't have any gold so so who thought that was a good idea [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3530.0s)]
*  I don't know but you know, they decided to solve that couple of years ago [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3537.04s)]
*  and so and now we are in a very bad situation because [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3541.36s)]
*  I believe that you know the [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3546.56s)]
*  The role of the u.s dollar will be very different. Yes, something will happen [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3548.8s)]
*  To solve your problem about you know, the manufacturing it's a blessing and a curse [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3554.2400000000002s)]
*  No, that's right. Having the world's reserve currency is [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3558.48s)]
*  And once the war in ukraine started and sanctions were used as a as a weapon [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3561.52s)]
*  Um, the dollar was used as a weapon. It was the end of the long term [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3566.64s)]
*  It was the beginning of the end of the u.s dollar. Yeah, the the the dollarization is coming and it's happening right now [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3570.88s)]
*  So it's a question of time, but I understand that president trump wants to [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3577.76s)]
*  Do the transition? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3583.52s)]
*  Uh, but it it would hurt it would be difficult. Yes, it will [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3585.04s)]
*  Uh, and and I you know, I agree with him about his end goal to have manufacturing sector back in the u.s [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3588.4s)]
*  I want the same in canada and so we must have a real [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3595.04s)]
*  Uh, good economic policies and you know the way to solve that we have our bank of canada [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3599.7599999999998s)]
*  Did the same thing like the fed during covet 19? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3605.36s)]
*  We printed a lot of money now [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3608.08s)]
*  We have that inflation and and i'm the only politician who's saying, you know [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3609.6s)]
*  We need to have a zero inflation target with the bank of canada our bank of canada [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3613.44s)]
*  As a target of two percent inflation every year 20 inflation talker is bad [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3620.56s)]
*  Two percent inflation is bad. We need to have zero inflation like that. Everybody will keep their purchasing power [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3626.96s)]
*  And so and and if you want to have that you need to have a balanced budget [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3633.36s)]
*  So we balance the budget in first year. We tell the bank of canada a zero inflation target [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3638.64s)]
*  We have surplus and all the surplus must go to to lower taxes to canadians and you know a flat tax on business [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3644.32s)]
*  No more capital gains tax. That's our proposal [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3652.16s)]
*  For canadian to have a better and a more productive economy [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3655.52s)]
*  Poliev won't speak about that corny won't speak about that [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3660.0s)]
*  But we need to tackle that president trump is doing that right now [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3663.6800000000003s)]
*  He's trying to do that right now. There's a cost to that but at least it's not [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3667.6800000000003s)]
*  Kicking the can down the road for sure like everybody did before him [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3672.6400000000003s)]
*  If you have debt levels at the level that canada does certainly in the united states much bigger debt than canada's you have the government needs inflation [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3677.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the government creates inflation because they that's the only way to get out of the debt, right? Yeah [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3685.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, no one says that no [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3689.52s)]
*  This is like a product of choices that our policymakers [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3691.52s)]
*  consciously make in order to [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3695.1s)]
*  You know inflate down the debt. Yeah, but that's that's what happened after the second world war in canada [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3698.08s)]
*  You know we had in the 1940s. We had 10 years of inflation to pay for the the debt [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3703.6s)]
*  That we had after the war so now, you know, not only the u.s canada [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3710.24s)]
*  And all western countries, you know have huge debt huge deficit [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3715.04s)]
*  So something will happen so and you know, we will have to reevaluate gold [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3719.92s)]
*  We may have a kind of a gold standard [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3725.36s)]
*  But inflation is bad for the population. It's good for government because they can print money print money and you know [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3728.16s)]
*  giving us a lot of [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3736.7200000000003s)]
*  A lot of gifts with you know paying for a lot of programs [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3739.52s)]
*  But [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3744.48s)]
*  You know that is creating inflation and now you have inflation in the u.s [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3745.36s)]
*  And we have inflation in canada and we may have that inflation for the next five ten years [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3749.76s)]
*  That's a way to deal with the debt and i'm saying that you know the deficit of today are the taxes of tomorrow [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3755.76s)]
*  Or the inflation of tomorrow [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3762.7200000000003s)]
*  So the inflation is coming is there and it is coming and when you have inflation what will happen after that? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3764.96s)]
*  Interest rate they will have to go up [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3770.96s)]
*  so [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3773.6s)]
*  We are in a very difficult situation [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3774.64s)]
*  Canada and u.s and and other, you know western countries right now [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3777.2s)]
*  So that's why what trump is doing by all these tariffs is asking all these countries come and have a negotiation [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3781.52s)]
*  But I believe the negotiation won't be on paris. It will be of a new monetary order [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3787.84s)]
*  We need that I think that's right and it's inevitable. You know, we're getting it [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3793.36s)]
*  De-dollarization is real and it's and again, it's just inexorably can't stop it [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3797.28s)]
*  So it does seem big picture if you're just looking at the world a lot of these conflicts are about resources [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3801.52s)]
*  Like physical things. Yeah oil and gas iron ore [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3807.36s)]
*  bauxite grain gold, I mean right uranium [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3811.82s)]
*  Canada has a lot of not all but a lot of those things some of the deepest deposits in the world water [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3816.88s)]
*  Canada has massive amounts of fresh water. So [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3822.4s)]
*  I'm wondering what's happening to all your resources. Is anyone paying attention you I mean because china needs the resources [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3825.76s)]
*  Yeah to fuel its manufacturing asian and broadly speaking asian needs those resources [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3832.0s)]
*  Are they still under canadian control? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3837.04s)]
*  It's a good question because china tried to buy some of our resources a couple of years ago [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3840.16s)]
*  And at least the federal government did stop that. So yes, it is under our control, but the problem is not [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3845.2s)]
*  who [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3852.16s)]
*  Is controlling our natural resources? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3853.52s)]
*  it's [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3856.4s)]
*  We are not able to exploit them with our regulations and taxes the last 10 years the 10 years the total government [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3857.36s)]
*  Told the you know the industry the mining industry and oh, you know oil and gas and we need to get rid of that [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3865.28s)]
*  It's not it's not clean and we cannot exploit that so he put a lot of regulations. We cannot have pipeline [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3871.52s)]
*  We cannot exploit and and export our natural resources [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3878.0s)]
*  No pipelines [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3882.5s)]
*  So and that's that's the problem. It's the regulations and the fact that the federal government [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3883.7799999999997s)]
*  Is doing everything to stop the exploitation of all natural resources to do with everything to do that and it was successful [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3890.02s)]
*  So now we don't have any pipelines [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3898.2599999999998s)]
*  And so we are sending our oil and gas to you guys to the us [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3900.5s)]
*  At a discount because we cannot have access to another to other markets [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3905.3799999999997s)]
*  So good for you but bad for us [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3909.86s)]
*  So we need to do that and we are this country canada can be a great country if we have the right policies [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3912.26s)]
*  so, um, I I don't I mean it's very obvious that [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3920.42s)]
*  Climate change has been going on since the beginning of time, right? The climate we had glaciers now we don't etc. Etc [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3924.6600000000003s)]
*  The climate is always changing [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3930.42s)]

*  Which is slightly more rational than the west I would say looks at climate change and says well [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3949.38s)]
*  Wow, this is good for us because we're a really cold country and huge parts of our of our country are inaccessible [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3954.02s)]
*  Because of cold and if it gets warmer, that's like good for us [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3959.54s)]
*  That would be especially true for canada [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3963.46s)]

*  No, it it is not bad [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3985.94s)]
*  but for them it is so bad that we must fight that and you [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3987.38s)]
*  It's so bad that we think that we can control the climate [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3992.34s)]
*  You know, it's it crazy, you know, we can we [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3995.86s)]
*  You men can control the climate by you know regulation and things like that. It's so [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=3999.3s)]
*  Complex that we cannot but but there's no climate emergency. Can you understand that? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4004.6400000000003s)]
*  Also, there's we can't control the climate. Yeah, we can't you're right about right because we're not god [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4010.6600000000003s)]
*  Canada was a religious country even when I was a kid the french canadians were very religious [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4016.1800000000003s)]
*  They built all through the you know, northern new england. There are all these yeah [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4020.02s)]

*  But um, and those cities are all african [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4029.38s)]
*  But but anyway, there was a time when canada was a very religious country now [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4031.94s)]
*  It seems like one of the most non-religious atheist countries in the world. Is that your [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4035.46s)]
*  But we are not promoting our history as a country with that multiculturalism act, you know, you can come here and you know, you know [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4040.34s)]

*  But that being said in our constitution [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4052.26s)]
*  It is written in our constitution that this country has been built on the supremacy of god and the rule of law [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4055.1400000000003s)]
*  That's part of our constitution [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4060.7400000000002s)]
*  but yes, actually [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4062.5800000000004s)]
*  The [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4065.94s)]
*  We freedom of religions exists in our country and i'm okay with that [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4067.54s)]
*  But I I hope that we can promote our history, you know, this country canada has been built, you know with [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4072.5s)]
*  settler from france france from uk from [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4079.86s)]
*  And and with indigenous people [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4084.1s)]
*  But the new immigrants who are coming here, they don't know the history of this country [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4086.7400000000002s)]
*  You know i'm traveling across the country and I deliver a speech and they told me maxime you're an immigrant also [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4091.3s)]
*  I'm not an immigrant. I'm a settler, you know [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4098.58s)]
*  My descendants are french [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4102.259999999999s)]
*  You know i'm not I didn't [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4105.299999999999s)]
*  I didn't come to this country 20 years ago [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4107.54s)]
*  You know, my roots are deep in this country in canada [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4110.339999999999s)]
*  So so we need to that's why we need to stop that mass immigration [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4114.099999999999s)]
*  And and promote our history our value our values our culture plate saying quebec [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4118.66s)]
*  What does that mean? I remember I remember exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4125.379999999999s)]

*  so, um last question, how does this [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4133.38s)]
*  Impress, I mean it does seem like [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4136.74s)]
*  Any country ours definitely us definitely included reaches a tipping point with population where? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4139.38s)]
*  There are just too many people who have no roots in the country. Yeah that have different alien agendas [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4145.0599999999995s)]
*  And it basically becomes unmanageable and there's sort of no turning back the country can never be what it was [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4151.219999999999s)]
*  You can't make it great again [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4155.94s)]
*  How far is canada from that? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4157.86s)]
*  I'm looking in uk right now what's happening there and in france. We are not there [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4160.179999999999s)]
*  But we are near if we you know, I said 10 years ago [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4165.219999999999s)]
*  We need to have a maximum of one hundred not 10 years or eight years ago [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4168.82s)]
*  We need to have a maximum of 150 000 immigrants a year [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4173.46s)]
*  They didn't and at that time I was a racist because I was speaking like that [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4177.86s)]
*  But I was not and you know [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4181.7s)]
*  And now i'm saying we need to have that moratorium because you know, we had mass immigration [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4184.259999999999s)]
*  But if we don't stop in in 10 years, I I told you, you know [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4190.179999999999s)]
*  1.97 of our population [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4195.839999999999s)]
*  Uh, the growth of our population is coming from immigration if we have that [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4198.339999999999s)]
*  Two three or five years more [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4202.9s)]
*  I you know [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4205.46s)]
*  Problem will trouble will be on the street more often than they are right now [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4206.66s)]
*  So answering your question talker, we are near we are near that you know [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4211.379999999999s)]

*  And we the people's body are the only the only hope for this country [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4221.54s)]

*  We will be able to regain our country. But if we don't do that [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4231.78s)]
*  I'm scared. I'm scared for the future of our country [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4236.259999999999s)]

*  But on another level it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right now all the change taking place in our economy [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3Oz_TKB8c&t=4267.38s)]
