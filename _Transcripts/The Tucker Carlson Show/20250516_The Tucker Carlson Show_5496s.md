# Oren Cass: How Trump’s Tariffs Are Reversing the Foreign Policy That Doomed America’s Economy
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI)
*  In the next five years, we're clearly going to have some kind of economic reset. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=0.0s)]
*  People will get poorer. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3.92s)]
*  What's your position on Trump's tariffs? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5.12s)]
*  Are they working? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=7.92s)]
*  We should have them, but you should phase them in. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=8.88s)]
*  There are going to be obstructions. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=11.44s)]
*  If you are somebody who wants to do business in America, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=13.68s)]
*  you need to start planning for that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=16.4s)]
*  If we want our economy to work well, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  the way to make a lot of money in America is by making things in America. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=19.84s)]
*  That's like the most interesting thing I've heard in a long time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=23.52s)]
*  So you're saying that our economic model was not [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=25.52s)]
*  primarily an economic model, was an instrument of foreign policy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=28.48s)]
*  It was like the centerpiece of the global order, post-war global order. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=31.2s)]
*  It wasn't designed to help the United States as much as it was to preserve stability around the world. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=35.04s)]
*  If there's any group to whom we should be focusing resources on, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  it is families raising kids who are the ones who have been, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=44.4s)]
*  I think, most squeezed by these economic changes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=48.24s)]
*  We will have to pay for that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  And the people who will pay for it are the people who are earning a lot of money and don't have kids. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=52.96s)]
*  I love that you said that out loud. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=57.44s)]
*  Orrin Cass, thank you very much for coming. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=80.56s)]
*  So you've got a book called The New Conservatives, which tries to answer, I think, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=83.2s)]
*  and I'll speak for you, the question, what is conservatism? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=87.76s)]
*  What is the Trump movement? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=92.0s)]
*  Who's on what side? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=94.64s)]
*  And probably not a better, it's not really an abstract debate anymore. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=95.76s)]
*  It's like all of a sudden you find yourself, I find myself on the same side as people [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  with whom I don't think I have anything in common. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=107.12s)]
*  So what's your definition of conservative? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  That's the hardest question in conservatism, I think. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=114.56s)]
*  And for me, it comes down to a focus on what actually matters. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=118.0s)]
*  And sort of, all of our policy debates are about the means. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=122.64s)]
*  What should we do? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=126.0s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, what defines conservatism and what [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=127.76s)]
*  separates it from progressivism is the definition of the ends. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=131.28s)]
*  What do we actually think is the good life? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  What are we trying to achieve? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=136.8s)]
*  And I think for conservatives, there's a very deep recognition and belief that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=138.96s)]
*  the good life is about more than just the individual liberty and autonomy and consumption of stuff. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, we care about those things too, but that it is much more balanced against [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  a recognition that the well-being of families and the conditions in which we're raising [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=157.84s)]
*  the next generation and the strength of our communities, ultimately the strength of our [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=163.28s)]
*  nation, the ability to carry forward traditions, that all of those things are equally, probably [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=167.52s)]
*  more important to people's actual well-being. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  And that as we think about what government is for, what public policy is for, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=177.52s)]
*  those are the things we actually have to have in focus. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=182.4s)]
*  So paint the picture of what the end result of a well-organized society is. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=185.44s)]
*  Well, I think first and foremost, it is the family. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=191.52s)]
*  That at the end of the day, everything is oriented toward this question of how do we [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=194.16s)]
*  raise a next generation that is able to do what we have done, hopefully more than we have done, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=198.96s)]
*  to enjoy what we have enjoyed, hopefully more than we have enjoyed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=204.8s)]
*  And that that is a sort of fundamental obligation that we all have. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=209.2s)]
*  It's not a choice, a consumption choice, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  Some people go to Greece, some people raise the next generation. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=215.76s)]
*  I mean, as a descriptive matter, it is true. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=218.8s)]
*  But as a normative matter, as a question of should, that is what should happen and that is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=222.64s)]
*  what needs to happen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=228.16s)]
*  And so the question is, well, okay, what are the conditions in which that can and will happen? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=230.0s)]
*  We need to have the conditions where young people can see a future for themselves, forming [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=234.88s)]
*  families, being self-sufficient, supporting kids, being able to provide them a good environment. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  They need to be in communities that have not just strong institutions and good schools, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  but also just a basic sense of a common culture and a culture that is going to be a healthy one [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  for kids to grow up. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=261.36s)]
*  We obviously therefore need an economy that provides those kinds of jobs. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=263.44s)]
*  There need to be good jobs available to anybody who wants to work and is willing to work hard, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=267.52s)]
*  regardless of what their particular aptitudes and interests are, regardless of where they live. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=274.24s)]
*  The idea that, well, we'll get more growth if everybody moves to a big city is highly corrosive [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  to the idea that we will actually have a world of people raising strong families. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=287.68s)]
*  And then as you sort of keep zooming out, ultimately you get out to the level of the nation [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=292.48s)]
*  and you recognize that at the end of the day, you do have to have a country. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  A country is not just a market or an Olympics team. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  It is actually something with an identity within which people owe obligations to each other. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=310.96s)]
*  And not everybody is raising kids, but if you're not, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=316.4s)]
*  you have some obligation to the folks who are. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=320.4s)]
*  You have some obligation to those kids. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=322.96s)]
*  And as those kids grow up, they will in turn have obligations back to you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  And if you can't maintain that structure, and I think a lot of what you see in the modern West [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=329.6s)]
*  is struggles to maintain that structure, things start to fall apart. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=336.72s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin It sounds like socialism, Orin. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=341.6s)]
*  Orin Weiss No, I'm just kidding. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  It sounds beautiful, actually. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  And I should say for people who don't know, I'm not going to give your home address or anything, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=347.6s)]
*  but you kind of live that personally. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  You live in a smallish town, very far from a city. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  You have a family. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=357.6s)]
*  You're involved in the town on an official level. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=358.48s)]
*  You are living the life that you describe. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=364.24s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin I try to. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's important at that level because I think that what I'm describing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=368.16s)]
*  isn't sort of the ideal that I hope somebody goes and does. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=373.36s)]
*  I think it is, as I said, sort of that obligation that everybody should feel that they have, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=377.44s)]
*  and also that I would underscore that people can fulfill in lots of ways. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  You don't have to live in a building. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=388.08s)]
*  You can do these things in a city, too. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=389.76s)]
*  You can do these things with all sorts of jobs. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=392.08s)]
*  You can do these things in a family where both parents are working, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  in a family where only one parent is working. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=397.36s)]
*  But I think a lot of what we need to aspire to, and the fancy term for it is pluralism, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=399.68s)]
*  is the idea that having all of those different options is a good unto itself. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=406.72s)]
*  The fact that people can see that option set and find one that works for them [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=412.16s)]
*  is part of what leads to human flourishing, part of what makes it all work. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  And one of the things that our markets have pushed against, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=421.44000000000005s)]
*  the market just looks for the most efficient solution. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=426.32000000000005s)]
*  And that might be fine if you're just trying to sort of maximize your GDP growth. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=429.6s)]
*  But if the most efficient solution is to push everybody into any particular lane, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=435.12s)]
*  especially the kinds of lanes we've been pushing people into, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=439.92s)]
*  you don't actually get the outcomes you care about, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=444.16s)]
*  which is the ability for people to live good lives. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=446.8s)]
*  It's interesting you use the word obligation, our obligation to others, to our children, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=449.6s)]
*  to our neighbors, at least for old fashioned Protestant talk that I haven't heard in a long [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=456.4s)]
*  time from Protestants or anyone else. It's not a worldview that Ken Griffin [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=461.52s)]
*  talks about or probably believes in. Why don't we talk about that anymore? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=467.28s)]
*  Where does that obligation come from? And how do you restore people's sense of it? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=472.96s)]
*  Well, I think it's common to a lot of religions. You're right, there's the Protestant. You certainly [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=477.68s)]
*  find it in Catholic social teaching. I think you certainly find it in Judaism, which [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=483.52s)]
*  my reading of it is especially oriented around raising that next generation. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  And so not by coincidence do the world's great moral traditions have this embedded. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=495.28s)]
*  That kind of is the moral tradition, right? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=503.44s)]
*  Well, yes, that's right. There's a common thread there. I think you don't see it as much [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=504.96s)]
*  today for two reasons. One is that it is constraining, right? The entire premise of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=512.56s)]
*  obligations and duties as opposed to merely rights and privileges is that there are things [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  that you should be doing even if they are not the thing that is the most fun at that moment in time. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=524.7199999999999s)]
*  Even if they are not the thing that you personally want to be doing at that moment in time, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=529.5999999999999s)]
*  sometimes just because it is the right thing to do and it is something that is important to the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=535.5999999999999s)]
*  well-being of those around you. A lot of times I think what you find in these moral traditions is [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=541.92s)]
*  that also in the long run it is good for you too. That there is a recognition that humans are frail, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=547.28s)]
*  flawed people and simply pursuing what the economist would say is optimizing your well-being [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=556.4s)]
*  at every moment in time leads people to choose all sorts of things that are not actually good [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=562.8s)]
*  for them at all. That's what I find fascinating about speaking about these kinds of concepts of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=568.16s)]
*  obligation and duty in the good life is some people get very skeptical of this. They're like, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=575.68s)]
*  oh yeah, but no one's going to choose that when they could just have all this other stuff instead. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=579.68s)]
*  But you step back and you look at all of the available data and you say, no, no, they will [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  actually be happier if they choose all this stuff. People who are married are happier. People who [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=589.52s)]
*  have kids are happier. People later in life who have done these things live fuller lives overall. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=597.36s)]
*  They also tend to earn more money. They have whatever it is you actually want to achieve in [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=602.72s)]
*  your life. It is almost certainly the case that making these kinds of decisions will be good for [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=608.24s)]
*  you too. The problem is just that in the moment when you're 23, it's not necessarily a thing that [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=613.84s)]
*  you're going to choose. And in a sense, and this goes back to where you started with what is [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=620.64s)]
*  conservatism, it's a recognition that for people to lead good lives and make good decisions, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=626.08s)]
*  they need to be operating within this structure. They rely on institutions, their own families, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=632.48s)]
*  ideally an education system, ideally the broader culture to shape and form them and help them make [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  these kinds of decisions that will benefit them, they themselves in the long run. We're not just [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  asking for fixed bayonet charges into machine guns. We're talking about things that will be [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=652.64s)]
*  good for them, will be good for those around them, will be good for their own kids, but that we know [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=660.56s)]
*  are not things that they're just automatically going to choose by themselves. And so this is [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=667.36s)]
*  the other thing that you would just like. Well, why aren't we doing this? Part of it is people [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=673.04s)]
*  just don't like being constrained. Part of it is we have adopted this sort of what I call market [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=677.92s)]
*  fundamentalism, where economists and their way of thinking have somehow persuaded a lot of people [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=683.52s)]
*  that no, no, no, just everybody choosing what they think is good for them at every moment with [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=691.68s)]
*  no constraints is actually the way to optimize welfare for themselves, for the nation, for the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=697.04s)]
*  economy. And that's just not true. Everything you said, well, you've described the basis of any [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=703.04s)]
*  civilization, you know, no civilization can continue ignoring what you said. So it's obvious. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=710.0s)]
*  I mean, nothing's radical that you described. It's like fundamental, but it does feel like [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=720.0s)]
*  the generation that began in 1946 kind of like didn't know that or something, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=726.4s)]
*  spent the country into bankruptcy, sort of dying in their condos in South Carolina, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=731.5999999999999s)]
*  leaving nothing to their children or grandchildren. It does seem like things change. Those [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  assumptions change with the baby boom. I think that's right. And I think part of the answer is [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  is the sort of more skeptical or cynical one that, you know, this generation has not been especially [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=748.48s)]
*  thoughtful and obligation oriented. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=754.56s)]
*  Man, you ought to join the State Department. That level of diplomacy is awe-inspiring. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=760.56s)]
*  Many of my friends are boomers. Let me say. But I also think part of what we saw happen is that we [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=767.52s)]
*  went through, the boomers lived a life where everything did just seem to work. That, you know, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=775.84s)]
*  if you look, and sorry, I always come back to the economic side of these arguments because I see them [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=782.88s)]
*  sort of infecting our culture. You know, you had these folks like Milton Friedman as a classic [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  example of someone who was sort of making this very public case that literally his best work is [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  called free to choose, right? That was the mantra. And what Americans were experiencing in American [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=799.3599999999999s)]
*  society was that this just worked. That because we weren't paying attention to and were instead [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=806.32s)]
*  taking for granted all of that institutional capital we had built up in the American culture, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  because we were taking for granted that we were the dominant industrial power, you know, far and [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  away ahead of anybody else, it felt like, oh, you don't have to worry about these things. You can [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=823.5200000000001s)]
*  just leave people free to choose. They will just make these kinds of decisions. You know, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=830.48s)]
*  investors will just invest in the best things. We will get the best innovation. We will create [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=836.08s)]
*  the good jobs. This is just how things work. The magic hand. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=840.24s)]
*  Well, this is right. And this is something I write about a lot, right? Adam Smith, the father of [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=844.64s)]
*  capitalism, had this idea of the invisible hand, which if you go back and look at what he was [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  actually talking about, what he was describing, like literally in the paragraph where he writes [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=853.52s)]
*  about the invisible hand, he has all these requirements. Like if people prefer investing [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=858.72s)]
*  domestically to invest in foreign countries, if people focus on doing the things that will [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=863.76s)]
*  lead to the greatest outcome, you know, the greatest output and most jobs, then the economy [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=869.84s)]
*  will work. And in this generation, just all that got erased. It's actually interesting in the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=875.44s)]
*  leading economics textbook, it literally got erased. They just ellipsed it out and just left [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=880.72s)]
*  with the part that the invisible hand leads to this stuff. And so it sounds like a magical force. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=886.08s)]
*  Well, yeah, I call it magic. It's like the Holy Spirit. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=892.0s)]
*  Exactly. And this is why I call it market fundamentalism because it, you know, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=894.08s)]
*  it sounds like a derogatory term. Obviously, I'm using it somewhat derisively, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=899.6800000000001s)]
*  but it's a descriptive term. It is a fundamentalism, just like a religious fundamentalism, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=903.6s)]
*  that misinterprets the original texts and ideas to create this very absolutist, easy to live by [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=908.96s)]
*  framework, even though it's probably not actually true and probably isn't actually very good for [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=918.16s)]
*  people. And that is the course that the US set itself on and American culture set itself on [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=925.52s)]
*  in a period where things were working well, right? You can get away with it for a while. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=933.76s)]
*  And then, especially as the Cold War ended, as we sort of moved into this new world, it, I would say, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=938.24s)]
*  just it went off the rails and we started making choices in our foreign policy and our economic [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=944.96s)]
*  policy that assumed a whole bunch of things that certainly weren't true anymore, even if they ever [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=949.84s)]
*  had been true. And I think in both our culture and our economy, we're now sort of grappling with the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=956.4s)]
*  consequences of it. People are watching you without your knowledge [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=962.24s)]
*  every time you go online. Sorry to be creepy about it, but it's absolutely true. Data brokers [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=967.04s)]
*  record all of your activity, everything you do when you turn on your phone, your computer, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=972.56s)]
*  your laptop, that includes your search logs, everything. And they sell that information to [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=977.92s)]
*  advertisers, scammers, even government agencies. It's not good at all. There's no law against it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=982.56s)]
*  They're making a lot of money. So they don't think of you as a customer, really a human being. You're [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=988.56s)]
*  a product. They exploit you by stealing your privacy. It's stomach churning. By the way, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=993.44s)]
*  there should be a law against it, but there isn't. So in the meantime, ExpressVPN can help. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1002.0s)]
*  ExpressVPN is an app that hides your IP address. It reroutes 100% of your online traffic through [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  secure encrypted servers. That means nobody can see what you do on the internet. You keep your [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1012.24s)]
*  privacy a prerequisite to your freedom. With servers in over 100 countries, ExpressVPN is easily [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1017.12s)]
*  accessible. It's super easy to use, quick to install, completely worldwide. So if you're for [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1022.16s)]
*  freedom, you need ExpressVPN. You get an extra four months for free through this show's link. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1027.76s)]
*  Scan the QR code on the screen or go to expressvpn.com slash Tucker and get four extra months of ExpressVPN. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1032.56s)]
*  That's expressvpn.com slash Tucker. Yeah, I guess the good news is the consequences are now so [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1039.6s)]
*  obvious and so dire that I don't think anybody really is in favor of continuing to do what we've [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1047.12s)]
*  been doing for the last 50 years. Unfortunately, there are many people who still are. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1054.0s)]
*  Really? Yes, among those for whom this has all worked, right? Because there is still a class of [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1059.12s)]
*  people, certainly in the United States, if you are highly educated, living in certain regions. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1065.6799999999998s)]
*  Older. Older, certainly if you are the beneficiary, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1072.56s)]
*  and have all the savings from the golden era. But there are plenty of people in their 20s and 30s [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1077.12s)]
*  if they got, you know, were in the right place, have the right education, get the right kind of job. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  They're doing very well. And they have immersed themselves in a culture that says, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1092.8799999999999s)]
*  well, we are here because we deserve to be here. Right? In our wonderful meritocracy, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1100.1599999999999s)]
*  it is we who are supposed to be the winners and the ones who sort of make the decisions [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1106.08s)]
*  for everybody else. And let's look at just some economic statistics, like our TVs are bigger than [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1111.6s)]
*  ever. We have more stuff than ever. And so let's keep the good times rolling. That's, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1120.0s)]
*  you know, I think there's a lot of people. It's such a small percentage of the country, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1129.04s)]
*  though. Yes, it's in that position. So that's what I find baffling. It's like, I mean, of course, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1133.2s)]
*  famously, life is unfair. It's not exactly clear how real free will is. I mean, like lots of deep [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1140.0800000000002s)]
*  questions that arise when you think about how wealth is allocated. Luck plays a role or [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1147.2s)]
*  providence or whatever. But it's still hard. If you're in that percentage that's been benefiting [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1151.68s)]
*  and continues to benefit from the current arrangement, it's hard to understand how you [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1158.72s)]
*  don't look around and think to yourself, this isn't working for like the overwhelming majority [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1162.08s)]
*  of people. And that's bad. Like if that doesn't occur to you, what does it say about you? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1167.1999999999998s)]
*  It's a fair question. I guess, you know, one reason I have maybe sympathies strong, but a [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1172.8s)]
*  sense of it is I even look at, you know, my own trajectory going through a lot of these same [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1183.6799999999998s)]
*  institutions and kinds of jobs. You know, I ended up working for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1189.36s)]
*  After graduating Harvard. Yes. Well, actually, I was still in law school at Harvard, was in [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1195.12s)]
*  charge of domestic policy for the Romney campaign. And we started questions would come in, what are [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1201.4399999999998s)]
*  we going to do about the opioid epidemic? And I'm embarrassed to say this, I'm hopping on Google, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1207.52s)]
*  like, what is an opioid? Like, like opium? I mean, I literally had no idea. And at that point, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  it had already been the deadliest drug epidemic in American, you know, probably for going on a decade [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1222.5600000000002s)]
*  at that point. And it was extremely easy to not even know it existed, to have to have absolutely [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1228.3200000000002s)]
*  no contact with or familiarity with those kinds of challenges happening in other parts of the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1237.0400000000002s)]
*  country. It was extremely easy. If you had taken your economics class where they tell you that [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1243.76s)]
*  free trade benefits everybody, and, you know, maybe you lose a job, but it's okay, you get a [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1249.04s)]
*  better job, to then be working in a big city surrounded by other people have good jobs and [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1254.0s)]
*  just kind of assume that that happened. And I think, you know, one of the really important things [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1260.08s)]
*  about Donald Trump's success is that I do think that represents a point at which you can no [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1267.36s)]
*  longer say, well, you could reasonably be sitting around, just not understanding. At that point, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1273.52s)]
*  I think you face a choice, you either have to recognize, wow, there are some things I did not [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  understand that are serious problems that that we need to focus more on. Or, and plain people did [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1284.56s)]
*  this, you conclude, wow, I just don't like my country. The people must be too racist or [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1291.2s)]
*  xenophobic or just not understand how good they have it and good riddance. And let's be honest, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1297.52s)]
*  again, you're right, just a small share of the population, but among those with power and money [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1304.4s)]
*  and influence, it's a large share of the population that even with Donald Trump's success, even now, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1309.12s)]
*  went in that direction. And they call it, you know, a term, they call it grievance-anomics. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1317.6s)]
*  If you think there are problems out there that things are not going well, you're just feeding [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1323.28s)]
*  the grievances of those who should take opportunities. I think that's a moral crime, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1328.08s)]
*  that attitude, and I hope the people who have it are held responsible at some point. Sorry, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1333.8400000000001s)]
*  I can't, I have to, I've asked this before, you've never given me a real answer, so I'm just going to [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1338.8s)]
*  ask you one last time. Given your profile, your life history, the merit badges you collected, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1343.44s)]
*  the fact you went to Harvard Law School and worked for Mitt Romney, how did you wind up with these [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1349.6s)]
*  views? You're like the only person who did, JD Vance, okay, but he had a childhood that was [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1354.08s)]
*  different from yours. You, more than anybody I've ever met, like took a path that was not obvious at [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1360.4799999999998s)]
*  all given, why did you do that? It's a good question. I don't try to avoid answering. I don't [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1366.8799999999999s)]
*  necessarily have a great answer. I think if I were to pick two things, one is I ended up sort [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1373.92s)]
*  of hitting all those important checkpoints, but I kind of had a much quirkier upbringing. I give my [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1382.0800000000002s)]
*  parents a lot of credit. They were Americans, but they grew up overseas, met overseas in Israel, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1390.0s)]
*  and so met at the American school. My dad lived on a kibbutz. They got married there, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1398.72s)]
*  and so they moved back to the US. I was raised in the US, but with a just sort of different [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1404.9599999999998s)]
*  outlook. They hadn't come through that model that we were just talking about in the 60s and 70s. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1411.76s)]
*  They weren't here, and so- They were growing things? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1418.08s)]
*  Literally, that's right. My dad was head of irrigation on a desert kibbutz, and so like [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1422.24s)]
*  pipe, like literally nozzles on pipes. I look back and I realize that I've been incredibly [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1429.12s)]
*  fortunate to have been given at once both a lot of the sort of superficial accompaniments of the [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1438.24s)]
*  standard meritocracy, but also an outlook and set of values that from them really did [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1450.72s)]
*  focus much more on question one is family and what you're doing there, and how you structure [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1457.76s)]
*  a job and a career comes around that, and- Amen. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1465.76s)]
*  So on and so forth. Were they religious? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1468.96s)]
*  No, not especially. I think this is something you see a lot, and the Israeli connection is [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1471.1200000000001s)]
*  interesting there. On one hand, it's very religious. There's also just a very strong [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1481.76s)]
*  secular culture that I think exists there. I had that, and then the other thing I had, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1485.84s)]
*  my grandfather was an extraordinary trial lawyer, and from the age of about four, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1494.72s)]
*  my age of four, whatever I wanted to say, he would just immediately take the other side of it and [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1502.0s)]
*  start arguing with me about it. My first book is- He was willing to argue with a four-year-old? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1506.96s)]
*  Yes. If that was who was available to argue with, that was who he was going to argue with. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1513.52s)]
*  My first book is in memory of Irv, who always liked a good argument. I just grew up loving that, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1520.8000000000002s)]
*  and the idea that everything was always up for argument and testing both sides of, I think, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1530.48s)]
*  just left me at every stage reflexively unwilling to accept the- Sometimes in a very unhealthy [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1535.76s)]
*  contrarian way, but also in a healthy contrarian way, insisting on arguing about it and pushing [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1543.68s)]
*  on it from all directions. I think those two things then left me moving up through standard [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1550.4s)]
*  Republican conservative politics, but a little bit as an outsider and looking at saying, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1556.64s)]
*  why is that? I'm not sure that makes sense. That's not what I thought we were here to do. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1562.8s)]
*  I thought conservatism meant the things we've been talking about here, not tax cuts. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1567.28s)]
*  That led me down a lot of interesting paths. Well, it led you away from everybody in your world, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1573.68s)]
*  because I've lived here the whole time. The path for conservatives at Harvard Law School [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1581.6000000000001s)]
*  is well-trod, not a huge number, but there have been a lot over the years. I'm a socially liberal, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1588.4s)]
*  but economically conservative, and you literally took the inverse position. It's like the single [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1595.6000000000001s)]
*  most unpopular combination that you could have. Yeah, I guess that's true. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1601.84s)]
*  You guess that's true? That's definitely true. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1609.4399999999998s)]
*  Now that you mention it, I do think though, and this is my experience with all the work that [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1612.72s)]
*  we've been doing at American Compass over the last five years, which is my organization that [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1620.8799999999999s)]
*  works on, okay, what is conservatism? What should it mean going forward? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1626.08s)]
*  I find that as long as you're willing to engage people in good faith and try to understand [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1632.3999999999999s)]
*  what they think and tell them what you think and argue about it. Again, this is back to our mantra [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1641.12s)]
*  is intellectual combat with personal civility. Yeah, there are the people who will be like, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1647.76s)]
*  oh, well, I don't like that. I don't like that person anymore. The vast majority of people are [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1653.84s)]
*  actually really interested in it. I guess it would be interesting to be sitting here telling you [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1658.8799999999999s)]
*  about the huge personal cost I've paid for doing these things. Frankly, there hasn't been [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1666.72s)]
*  the personal cost at all. It's been very helpful. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1672.9599999999998s)]
*  You did give up a lot of money, just in point of fact, but whatever. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1675.52s)]
*  Well, certainly to do public policy instead of going and being in business, whatever, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1678.8s)]
*  but that's always been ever since I was a high school debate nerd. I was always wanted, like I [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1683.36s)]
*  said, always wanted to be arguing about stuff. So, okay, you managed, I think, in the four years, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1689.28s)]
*  five years you've been running it, okay, to remain pretty civil and people are civil back [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1697.6799999999998s)]
*  and like it's all interesting until the tariffs happen, at which point it becomes pretty [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1702.24s)]
*  emotionally charged, I would say. So, what's your position on Trump's tariffs? Are they working? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1707.76s)]
*  And what kind of response have you received as like one of the best known tariff proponents? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1715.76s)]
*  Yeah, it has been a fascinating time since the administration started, especially after [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1722.48s)]
*  Liberation Day. My view is that the direction that Trump and the administration are going, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1728.48s)]
*  it's exactly the right one. That the willingness to focus on how globalization failed, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1735.28s)]
*  that free trade isn't real, it has not worked out the way it was promised, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1741.36s)]
*  we need to move on to something else, is exactly right. The fact that they're willing to acknowledge [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1745.2s)]
*  it has costs and that we should bear those costs is extraordinary. I mean, how long has it been [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1750.56s)]
*  since we had politicians who were actually willing to stand up and say, yes, this isn't just a free [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1756.96s)]
*  lunch, there are actual costs here and we think they're worth it. And I think that's right too. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1762.0s)]
*  It's such a good point. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1769.28s)]
*  The irony, of course, is it's exactly the very important people, very serious people in the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1771.6s)]
*  newspaper columns and so forth who've been complaining like, oh, politicians won't do this, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1777.84s)]
*  they won't be serious. You finally get President Trump and Secretary Besson, people who are willing [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1782.72s)]
*  to say these things and immediately everybody attacks them. How dare you suggest we should [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1788.48s)]
*  accept any costs? Look at these fools saying, and it's like, no, this is exactly what actual [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1793.28s)]
*  leadership looks like. This is what we need if we are going to get back out of the hole that we've [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1799.68s)]
*  dug. I think that being said, especially when you are doing this kind of thing that does have [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1805.04s)]
*  upfront costs, you're kind of making an investment for a payout down the road, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1810.72s)]
*  you have to be really careful to keep those costs as low as you can and make sure you're [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1815.28s)]
*  setting yourself for as much of the return as you can. And I think in some of the sort of, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1820.8799999999999s)]
*  frankly, chaos that we've seen in changes in the policy, in a lot of people not necessarily [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1827.6s)]
*  being clear on, okay, where are we going and why, I think in some cases the costs have been higher [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  than they have to be. And I think it's been really encouraging to see, really after Liberation Day, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1841.2s)]
*  a bunch of shifts that have improved things. So I'm somebody who thinks tariffs are good, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1847.76s)]
*  we should have them, but you should phase them in. You should give people time to adjust. And so now [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1853.44s)]
*  we've started doing that, right? Tariffs were paused, so we have negotiations with China, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1860.32s)]
*  they've now come back down a bunch, so we can have negotiations. I think what we should have [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1864.96s)]
*  is a very clear commitment that down the road, two or three years out, for the long run, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1869.28s)]
*  countries that are not playing by the rules, obviously China, countries that are not willing [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1875.84s)]
*  to take a balanced approach to trade, yes, there are going to be tariffs, there are going to be [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1881.84s)]
*  obstructions. And if you are somebody who wants to do business in America, you need to start [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1886.8799999999999s)]
*  planning for that and you need to invest more in America. And going back to Adam Smith and what the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1892.24s)]
*  paragraph about the invisible hand actually says, if we want our economy to work well, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1898.88s)]
*  it has to be one where the way to make a lot of money in America is by making things in America. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1903.6000000000001s)]
*  Can we? Oh, yeah. It's one of the saddest things about this country. The country's getting sicker. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1912.48s)]
*  Despite all of our wealth and technology, Americans aren't doing well overall. Obesity, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1917.0400000000002s)]
*  heart disease, autoimmune conditions, all kinds of horrible chronic illnesses, weird cancers, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1922.24s)]
*  they're all in the rise. Probably a lot of reasons for this, but one of them definitely is [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1927.12s)]
*  Americans don't eat very well anymore. They don't eat real food. Instead, they eat industrial [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1930.56s)]
*  substitutes and it's not good. It's time for something new. And that's where masa chips come in. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1935.12s)]
*  Masa has decided to revive real food by creating snacks how they used to be made, how they're [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1941.6799999999998s)]
*  supposed to be made. A masa chip has just three simple ingredients, not 117. Three, no seed oils, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1946.6399999999999s)]
*  no artificial additives, just real delicious food. And I know this because we eat a ton of them in [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1953.6s)]
*  my house. And by the way, I feel great. So you can still continue to snack, but you can do it in a [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1958.3999999999999s)]
*  healthy way with chips without feeling guilty about it. Masa chips are delicious. They taste [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1963.36s)]
*  how a tortilla chip is supposed to taste. But the thing is you can hit them really, really hard, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1968.48s)]
*  and I have, and not feel bloated or sluggish after. You feel like you've done something decent for [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1973.4399999999998s)]
*  your body. You don't feel like you got a head injury or you don't feel filled with guilt. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1978.96s)]
*  You feel light and energetic. It's the kind of snack your grandparents ate. Worth bringing back. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1983.6000000000001s)]
*  So you can go to masachips.com. Masa is M-A-S-A by the way. masachips.com slash Tucker to start [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1987.8400000000001s)]
*  snacking. Get 25% off. We enjoy them. You will too. So for example, China, I heard the estimate from [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=1993.1200000000001s)]
*  someone in manufacturing yesterday makes the world's magnets. They're used in everything. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2002.4s)]
*  We have about two weeks left supply in the United States. China's cut off all shipments of magnets [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2013.68s)]
*  to the United States. How long do we build a magnet plant? Like how does that resolve? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2019.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. These things take time. I think it's funny, you said earlier, like, well, the good news is [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2026.64s)]
*  people are starting to realize how big a mess we've made. The other thing I always say is the good [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2032.48s)]
*  news is that we've done it to ourselves, which is, I guess, mixed news. But it's good news in that [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2037.2800000000002s)]
*  it is policy choices that we made that have led to this situation, which means we can make other [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2045.3600000000001s)]
*  policy choices. There are some things, if you think back in the 1970s with the oil crisis, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2051.76s)]
*  oil embargo and so forth, there was a situation where in the foreseeable period, we just didn't [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2058.2400000000002s)]
*  have oil. Now it turns out we actually did have massive reserves of oil. It took technological [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2064.8s)]
*  innovation to access it. But at least in the short to medium term, you could say like, look, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2069.36s)]
*  we just don't have the oil and our economy runs on oil. That's just a sort of geographic reality. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2073.2000000000003s)]
*  The problems that we have created with trade are not about actual geography. It's not like, oh, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2079.92s)]
*  shoot, we can't grow avocados. Where will we get the avocados from? The problems are all a result of [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2088.16s)]
*  our country's decision that we didn't care what we made or whether we made anything at all. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2095.28s)]
*  And other countries, China being obvious, but it's also Korea and Japan and Taiwan and Germany [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2100.4s)]
*  saying, no, it's actually really important to what we make. And so we are going to be the ones that [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2107.2s)]
*  invest in making it. And as a result, all of that investment, all of that technology went to those [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2112.32s)]
*  places. But if we make the other decision, if we say, no, actually, we care at least as much as [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2117.44s)]
*  those places, we are going to make things here too. We certainly, we have the natural resources, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2124.96s)]
*  we have the innate skill in the workforce, we have the capital, we can do it too. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2130.96s)]
*  And just two really good examples of this. One is Reagan actually did this. People are like, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2138.2400000000002s)]
*  oh, Ronald Reagan, free trader. Not true. The Libertarian Cato Institute, when Reagan left office, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2146.56s)]
*  Cato called him the worst protectionist since Herbert Hoover. Especially vis-a-vis Japan, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2152.88s)]
*  Reagan had no patience for the trading relationship as it was working. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2160.2400000000002s)]
*  And under threat of tariffs, just as Trump is doing now, Reagan went to the Japanese and said, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2164.32s)]
*  the way that you are flooding our market with Japanese-made automobiles cannot continue. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2171.0400000000004s)]
*  And the Japanese, not wanting the tariffs, said, okay, we will voluntarily cap how much we import [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2176.96s)]
*  into the United States and we will instead send Honda and Toyota to go invest in the United States. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2184.08s)]
*  And the entire American auto industry in the American South is a function of that, of us, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2189.84s)]
*  of Reagan saying, free trade does not work here. You need to come invest here. And lo and behold, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2195.68s)]
*  American workers can build great cars, including Hondas and Toyotas. Toyota actually has, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2203.04s)]
*  Toyota Camry has more American-made content in it than anything coming out of Detroit. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2209.04s)]
*  And that was an extraordinary success. Really? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2215.04s)]
*  Yes. Because it wasn't just, so the first thing that happens is the assembly plant comes over. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2217.92s)]
*  Once this is a place where you're assembling, well, now it makes sense to move the supply chains over. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2223.76s)]
*  Now it makes sense, even now they have research and development facilities here. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2227.76s)]
*  This is how these countries got everything from us. They took the American manufacturers and said, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2231.76s)]
*  come over here instead. And it all moved. In a case where we've actually said, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2236.16s)]
*  no, you have to bring it here, that works too. And the other great example we're seeing now is [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2240.56s)]
*  with semiconductors. We have what's called the Chips Act, where we basically said, wow, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2246.0s)]
*  it's a huge mistake that America, inventor of the semiconductor, pioneer of pretty much everything [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2250.8799999999997s)]
*  chips related. We just said we didn't care. We let all go overseas. The reason Taiwan, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2256.72s)]
*  it's not because Taiwan's beaches are made out of silicon. There's nothing special about Taiwan. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2262.88s)]
*  The Taiwanese government said, we're going to lead in chips. And now that the US has said, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2268.56s)]
*  no, we're going to lead in chips and Taiwan semiconductor is making 60 billion, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2273.52s)]
*  now another 100 billion of investment in Arizona. Their first plant is coming online and they [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2278.8s)]
*  actually said the yield's coming out of it. So basically the quality of the chip manufacturing [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2283.92s)]
*  in Arizona is already better than in Taiwan. So we can do it, but it's a policy choice of [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2288.16s)]
*  whether we care and whether we're going to do it. So, you know, we can't make everything. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2294.96s)]
*  What should we make? So if you were in charge of reshoring manufacturing to the United States, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2302.7999999999997s)]
*  what would be the industries that would get priority? So I think there are a few that you [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2309.44s)]
*  really give priority to because they have some kind of unique strategic value, either for defense [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2313.84s)]
*  purposes or because of the way supply chains grow up around them. And so chips is a great example of [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2319.44s)]
*  this. Critical minerals, you mentioned the magnet, is a great example of this. I think batteries, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2325.6800000000003s)]
*  whether it's for electric vehicles, for electric grid generally, for all sorts of uses, is probably [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2332.32s)]
*  one of these things. And so there are a few particular things you want to identify and say, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2337.52s)]
*  we have to have this. And that's where I would use what's called industrial policy, right? You [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2342.16s)]
*  just literally say, we've decided this industry is important and government, you know, people [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2347.52s)]
*  call this picking winners and losers. It's not picking this company wins, this company loses, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2352.48s)]
*  but it's picking, we actually have a point of view as a country that we want this thing. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2357.6s)]
*  Beyond that, one of the things that's so great about tariffs, it's funny, I'm having a lot of [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2364.16s)]
*  fights about people with this right now, because in my view, tariffs are actually the free market [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2368.72s)]
*  approach. A tariff, it can be a very broad based policy. You're not picking a particular industry, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2374.16s)]
*  you're just saying, look, we are going to give an advantage to things made domestically. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2381.68s)]
*  So whichever things make, relatively speaking, the most sense to make domestically will come back. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2386.56s)]
*  The things that, relatively speaking, make the least sense to make domestically will stay [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2393.04s)]
*  elsewhere. We don't have to tell people what to invest in. We can just tell people all things [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2398.32s)]
*  equal, we're giving a 10% advantage to making things here. Now go. And I think that creates a [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2404.6400000000003s)]
*  much healthier economic system. It's much closer to Adam Smith's invisible hand and means we have [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2412.6400000000003s)]
*  to have less regulation, right? We don't have to go around figuring out, oh, what's every other [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2420.48s)]
*  country doing? What do we have to correct this way or that way? We don't then have to say, oh, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2425.52s)]
*  and let's not forget all the losers. We have to now have a whole other set of programs to help [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2430.56s)]
*  everybody who isn't succeeding because we don't have this stuff. We just say, we actually want [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2434.48s)]
*  to have a free market in the United States, but it has to be one that makes things. And so [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2439.7599999999998s)]
*  we hereby give an advantage to whoever wants to make something here. And then, as the Chinese [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2446.24s)]
*  would say, let the flowers bloom. Why is that so hard to do? That seems pretty straightforward. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2452.24s)]
*  I would imagine it would have overwhelming popular support. What's the process by which [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2459.52s)]
*  that gets done and why hasn't it been? Well, the reason it hasn't been is because [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2464.72s)]
*  our point of view was that nothing that I just said was true, right? Our point of view, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2470.56s)]
*  in terms of the underlying assumptions, our point of view is that making things doesn't matter. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2476.0s)]
*  There's a very famous quote attributed to Michael Boskin, who was the George H.W. Bush's [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2480.08s)]
*  chief economic advisor. He literally said, potato chips, computer chips, what's the difference? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2486.24s)]
*  If that is your economic theory, then yeah, who cares? If the idea is, well, anything that China [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2493.6s)]
*  can make more cheaply, we want China to make it, then why on earth would you put a thumb on the [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2499.84s)]
*  scale to make something here? And so that model persisted for a very long time and it persisted [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2506.0s)]
*  partly on the very foolish assumption that we just don't care if we can make anything. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2514.24s)]
*  It also persisted on the foolish assumption that don't worry, these things will sort of [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2519.2s)]
*  self-correct and work themselves out. So the best way I think to see how badly things have gone is [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2522.96s)]
*  our trade imbalance, right? We bring in more than a trillion dollars more stuff from overseas every [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2530.96s)]
*  year than we sell to the rest of the world. That suggests that trade isn't working very well. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2537.28s)]
*  Paul Krugman famously said, trade deficits are self-correcting. There was an economic theory [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2543.28s)]
*  that said such imbalances won't persist, they will take care of themselves. Krugman, I was actually, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2549.28s)]
*  this was a discussion I was part of with him and I said, why do you say that? And he said, yeah, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2555.12s)]
*  that was naive. Like just, sorry, we built an awful lot on that idea and that was just wrong. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2560.64s)]
*  You see the same thing, Janet Yellen, who was Biden's Treasury Secretary, has recently said, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2566.48s)]
*  look, the standard economic model was if someone will send you something for cheaper, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2571.92s)]
*  you just send a thank you note. And she said, I would never say that again. That just wasn't true. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2577.44s)]
*  And so one reason we have not done it is because we actively believe things that were wrong [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2584.8799999999997s)]
*  and we are fortunately now starting to realize that and try to fix it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2590.16s)]
*  I would argue that's all clearly true. Slightly more complicated though, because it wasn't [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2594.96s)]
*  just that people believed something that was wrong, now demonstrably, it was that the people [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2600.0s)]
*  who argued it was wrong weren't just like debated in good faith, they were destroyed as people. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2605.92s)]
*  So the two biggest advocates of the position you're describing now were Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2612.08s)]
*  And both of them were kind of driven from public life on the basis of claims that they were like, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2618.56s)]
*  not just wrong on economics, but like dangerous bad people. What was that? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2622.88s)]
*  It's a great point. And I'm using Krugman again as an example, he actually has a fascinating essay [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2628.8s)]
*  where he says, look, some people won't understand this stuff that we now know is not true. And you're [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2634.96s)]
*  not going to convince them. So the best tool you have is ridicule. That, that if you wrote that, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2641.52s)]
*  yeah, yeah, right, right, still up there on the web, that it's not going to work to persuade them. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2646.96s)]
*  But with sufficient ridicule, you can either essentially force them to stop saying it or [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2652.1600000000003s)]
*  make sure that nobody else listens to them. And it worked in both cases. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2657.52s)]
*  There's another, I guess this is Krugman, this is the Krugman segment of the show. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2661.28s)]
*  There's a very famous anecdote. Danny Rodrik, who's an economist at Harvard and one of the very few [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2666.2400000000002s)]
*  people who has always been skeptical of globalization, tells the story of sending out [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2672.08s)]
*  his manuscript for a book about this to Krugman to ask his feedback. And Krugman writes back, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2677.44s)]
*  you know, the substance of this is all fine, but you shouldn't do it. You will give ammunition to [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2683.44s)]
*  the barbarians. Hey, it's Tucker Carlson. You may have noticed that the companies, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2688.56s)]
*  these products you buy tend to kind of hate you. They're controlled by massive multinational [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2692.24s)]
*  corporations and they have all kinds of weird agendas that you're supporting when you buy their [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2697.52s)]
*  product. We didn't realize that nicotine pouches, which we've used for years, were in this category. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2701.44s)]
*  We just want a nicotine pouch. And then they lecture you and take the money you give them to [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2706.96s)]
*  support things that you hate. So we decide we're going to make our own. And we did. And it is, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2711.12s)]
*  we can say, not bragging here, just stating fact, the single best nicotine pouch in the world. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2715.68s)]
*  It's called Alvin and it comes in all kinds of excellent flavors. Wintergreen, tropical fruit, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2721.44s)]
*  chilled mint, refreshing, chill, sweet nectar, and a bunch of others that were rolling out. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2727.6s)]
*  By the way, there are 20 per tin, not 15 like some of our competitors will not be named Zen. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2731.92s)]
*  And they're in three, six, and nine milligrams. It is the single best nicotine pouch ever made. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2737.6s)]
*  You will not regret it. So that's what I don't understand. So why, I mean, typically even was [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2743.12s)]
*  a debate between, you know, the Keynesians and the Milton Friedman people. It didn't get to that level [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2750.3199999999997s)]
*  of like, let's just wreck the person. Let's make, you know, let's make his wife divorce him. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2757.6s)]
*  But it did, no, but it did on, you know, I mean, it kind of wrecked Ross Perot's life, wrecked [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2762.64s)]
*  Pappy Cannon's life. Like, why were the stakes so high on this one question? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2769.36s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'll give you, I'll give you my theory for it. Because I've tried to go back and find [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2774.16s)]
*  like, where did these economic arguments come from when they're clearly just not true? And [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2779.04s)]
*  as best I can tell what happened, particularly after World War II, and this was in this, you know, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2786.1600000000003s)]
*  era where people kind of were rightfully saying, you know, never again, obviously about the Holocaust [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2791.6000000000004s)]
*  more broadly about World War II, we, we can never go back to that kind of conflict. And you have the [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2796.96s)]
*  United Nations, you have all of these sorts of, right? Like that is everybody's focus. And that is [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2802.0s)]
*  when the arguments about free trade actually start to emerge. And they emerge not actually [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2808.56s)]
*  primarily as economic arguments, they emerge as a sort of new model of a, of a global world order. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2815.04s)]
*  And, you know, one thing people looked at, they- [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2823.36s)]
*  Now you're getting to the heart of it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2825.36s)]
*  Well, you know, once things, when people look at, you know, what happened after World War I, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2827.2s)]
*  the way Germany had been treated, the idea that, you know, sort of holding them down rather than [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2830.72s)]
*  supporting them helps lead to World War II. So how are we going to rebuild the world after World [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2835.12s)]
*  War II? How are we going to build a sort of inclusive market that builds these companies up? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2839.44s)]
*  How are we going to rebuild Japan as a democracy? How are we going to rebuild Germany as a [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2844.08s)]
*  democracy? How are we going to combat the Soviet Union, which remember is out there now putting [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2847.44s)]
*  out this ideology that says markets just can't work at all? We are going to put forward this vision. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2853.44s)]
*  And the best illustration of this is Guy Paul Samuelson, Nobel Prize winner, sort of writes the [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2860.0s)]
*  The Standard Economics textbook that comes out in 1948, right after World War II. Remember I [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2866.96s)]
*  mentioned the invisible hand gets ellipsed. That's in this textbook. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2872.08s)]
*  And- [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2876.56s)]
*  Which was the textbook for generations. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2876.8s)]
*  It was the textbook, exactly. And you know, I have a copy now. I went and got like, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2878.0s)]
*  you go through it and you say, okay, like, well, how does he make the argument about free trade? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2884.8s)]
*  And what you find is that he really doesn't. He actually acknowledges all the ways that free [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2889.76s)]
*  trade might not work, that it might be bad for the United States, especially if other countries [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2894.48s)]
*  behave a certain way. And he says, quite bluntly, basically, so what? That if we actually want to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2899.36s)]
*  build this kind of global economy that we all agree we need, the United States basically just [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2909.28s)]
*  needs to take the lead and push this forward. And- [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2914.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2918.0s)]
*  And look, again, and maybe I'm being too charitable again, but like, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2920.3199999999997s)]
*  I can see why someone would say that in 1948. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2924.7999999999997s)]
*  I totally agree. And I got to college 40 years after that book was written and it was assigned, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2926.96s)]
*  it was the first book you read in economics class. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2932.0s)]
*  Yeah. And by the way, you could even say it was right in 1948. And this goes to the point [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2933.6s)]
*  about the boomers, that the policy as we pursued it into the 50s and 60s did accomplish a lot of [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2939.2s)]
*  what we wanted it to. There's a very famous article in Foreign Affairs in 1971 where one of [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2946.16s)]
*  the kind of leaders of international economic thinking says quite explicitly, he says, the case [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2954.48s)]
*  for free trade has always been primarily a foreign policy case, not an economic policy case. And then, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2960.56s)]
*  of course, you get to that when we get to China, right? The entire argument- [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2966.8s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2970.0800000000004s)]
*  The entire argument for welcoming China into the WTO. I mean, economists said like, oh, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2970.96s)]
*  this will create good jobs for Americans and whatever. But the actual argument was, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2975.1200000000003s)]
*  this is going to fix China. This is the way we democratize China, we liberalize China. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2979.92s)]
*  And if that happens, if China does become a liberal democracy and we do bring them forward [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2986.0s)]
*  in this way, then won't it be wonderful that we have trade with them and won't it be great [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2991.36s)]
*  that everybody prospers? And again, that wasn't like, if that had happened, that might have been [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=2996.88s)]
*  a good idea too. The problem is that in the post-Cold War era, this model fell apart very quickly. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3003.36s)]
*  Wait, can I see, why have I never heard this before? I mean, it's like the most interesting [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3013.84s)]
*  thing I've heard in a long time. So you're saying that our economic model was not primarily an [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3018.96s)]
*  economic model, it was an instrument of foreign policy. It was like the centerpiece of the global [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3023.6s)]
*  order, post-war global order. And it wasn't designed really to help the United States as much as it was [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3029.92s)]
*  to preserve stability around the world? Is that what you're saying? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3037.36s)]
*  Yes. I know there are other people who say that. I've written an essay about it. It's called the [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3040.08s)]
*  Free Trade Origin Myth that kind of goes through the chapter and verse on all these various things. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3044.8s)]
*  The way it was presented to me as someone who was always conservative and for markets and repeated [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3050.5600000000004s)]
*  all the slogans and all that and was living in a world where I didn't know a single person who [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3054.96s)]
*  disagreed, talk about a bubble, was that free market economics in the way that the United States [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3058.96s)]
*  was doing it was not really an instrument, wasn't even a theory, it was like a physics principle. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3065.6000000000004s)]
*  It's just true. And to the extent that you deviate from it, you get punished. To the extent that you [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3072.6400000000003s)]
*  hew to it, you're rewarded because like gravity, it's just real. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3077.92s)]
*  And this is the fundamentalism. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3082.08s)]
*  I had no idea that this was like the UN, something that people who are understandably [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3086.7200000000003s)]
*  horrified by what they've just gone through, the world war, it was part of their reaction to that. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3093.52s)]
*  This will prevent that from happening again. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3099.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And another good example is, so if you go back, so Samuelson is the key post-World War [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3101.68s)]
*  textbook. There's a prior textbook by a guy named Alfred Marshall, who's kind of seen as the father [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3106.96s)]
*  of modern economics. Adam Smith is the original guy. Alfred Marshall is a British economist, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3112.64s)]
*  probably the first one to actually be called an economist. No one would have called Adam [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3120.3999999999996s)]
*  Smith an economist back in the day. So Marshall writes probably the first economics textbook, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3123.4399999999996s)]
*  comes out in like 1890. And he says essentially nothing positive about free trade. He actually [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3128.64s)]
*  has a whole section, the comparative advantage is this idea that free trade works out great for [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3134.8799999999997s)]
*  both sides. And it's attributed to a guy named David Ricardo, who was a great early 1800s economist. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3141.2799999999997s)]
*  Marshall has a whole section called the narrowness of the Ricardians, where he specifically says, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3150.16s)]
*  look, Ricardo has this nice theory, has some good math associated with it, but it only works in very [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3156.4s)]
*  limited circumstances. It makes a lot of sense that Britain as a global empire is promoting it, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3162.96s)]
*  but there are lots of people it doesn't work for. The Americans don't believe it. The Germans don't [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3169.52s)]
*  believe it. And he even has this hilarious footnote where he says a lot of these ideas [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3173.6s)]
*  basically seem to be used as a way for people to put one over on the working class. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3178.32s)]
*  And so like, again, all of this, and then if you even go back to Ricardo, like, and Adam Smith, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3184.64s)]
*  these guys, as I was saying, Adam Smith knew the invisible hand didn't work automatically. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3190.32s)]
*  Ricardo, when he's talking about free trade, he gives the example of how it could work. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3194.2400000000002s)]
*  The famous example is England specializes in cloth, Portugal specializes in wine, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3198.64s)]
*  and here's all the great ways it works them to trade. Right there on the same page, he says, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3204.7200000000003s)]
*  by the way, this only works if capital is immobile. Meaning, if the British cloth makers [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3210.4s)]
*  can't pick up and go make the cloth in Portugal, it's right there. And then even more, he notes, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3215.44s)]
*  and he hopes that never changes, that the idea that basically people were going to be stuck [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3222.6400000000003s)]
*  investing and doing business in their own countries was one of the core premises of any of this [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3229.36s)]
*  working. So it's all there, and it's only post-World War II that you get, partly for the foreign [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3235.68s)]
*  policy reason, and then building on that, people looking around like Milton Friedman, like Friedrich [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3241.8399999999997s)]
*  Hayek, and just saying like, wow, like, this is all just working. Right? Friedrich Hayek used this [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3247.2799999999997s)]
*  term, the self-regulating market. And he actually, it's funny that Hayek, he was one of these [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3252.3999999999996s)]
*  libertarians who's now associated with the right of center, and people say like, oh, like, conservative [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3258.48s)]
*  economics. Hayek has a very famous essay called Why I Am Not a Conservative, in which he specifically [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3264.0s)]
*  mocks conservatives for not being comfortable enough with the idea that markets are just [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3269.76s)]
*  self-regulating and will automatically deliver good answers. And so there's sort of this weird way [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3274.72s)]
*  where the ideas morph into, well, it's working, well, it must work automatically, all the way to [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3281.2s)]
*  this fundamentalism where, like you said, it's just like a law of physics, and if you don't [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3287.92s)]
*  understand that, you must be an idiot, and more importantly, you must be a heretic. And heretics [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3292.08s)]
*  are the one thing we cannot have. Boy, I mean, well, that's just, we watch that happen. We watch [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3297.12s)]
*  that happen. And I participated in the slander, by the way. I have my original college economics [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3302.56s)]
*  paper I've got, like, here's my two-page item, why free trade is good. And I have this great sentence [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3312.16s)]
*  that's like, you know, while some workers will lose their jobs, they will find better ones, like, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3316.96s)]
*  A. Correct answer. That's what you were supposed to say. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3323.28s)]
*  So what's the reaction to the administration's tariffs in Washington? My sense is not positive, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3328.88s)]
*  but you're closer to this. Well, it's interesting. Washington is changing. I mean, you now, right, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3338.96s)]
*  the Trump administration, I think one of the very cool things about, and most encouraging things [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3343.04s)]
*  about the second Trump administration compared to the first one, is that there is now an entire team [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3348.56s)]
*  of people who understand this stuff, are aligned on it, are carrying it out, right? In Trump's first [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3354.4s)]
*  term, Bob Lighthizer, who was, I think you had him on recently. Oh, yeah. A wonderful guy, he's been [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3360.08s)]
*  an incredible mentor to me. He wrote a wonderful book called No Trade is Free. That talks about [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3366.48s)]
*  his whole history working on this, but especially then, you know, in the Trump administration, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3374.6400000000003s)]
*  how even just within the senior Trump team, like these ideas that we're talking about were [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3378.4s)]
*  incredibly controversial. There were a lot of people who were still like, nope, free trade, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3383.92s)]
*  you know, how little, like, let's just make sure Trump doesn't disrupt things too much. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3387.76s)]
*  And now you have a team from Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, Stephen Mirren, the head of [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3392.1600000000003s)]
*  the Council of Economic Advisers, James Green, the US Trade Representative, obviously JD Vance, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3397.6s)]
*  Howard Lutnick at Commerce. All of these people are on the same page, that this needs to change, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3403.92s)]
*  and they're going to push forward this new approach. And so, you know, and they have teams [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3410.1600000000003s)]
*  that understand that and are working on that. And so, you actually have a whole administration [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3415.36s)]
*  and then an ecosystem of organizations around them working on this stuff that are supportive. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3421.36s)]
*  In Congress now, you know, they've been trying to bring these resolutions of disapproval, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3427.76s)]
*  and Democrats vote to disapprove just because they disapprove of Trump, even though like, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3433.04s)]
*  isn't that funny that all of a sudden Democrats are now the, you know, free traders, like, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3438.88s)]
*  literally Democrats are now fighting with labor unions over this, because the labor unions, to a [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3443.76s)]
*  degree, are like, oh, yeah, like, hey, this is actually the kind of stuff that we wanted, that [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3447.84s)]
*  we were talking about back in the 90s when we were shamed for it. And now the Democrats are shaming [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3452.0800000000004s)]
*  them for it. But the Republican Party, generally speaking, is quite supportive of it. Some are [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3456.6400000000003s)]
*  mostly supportive because it's the party line, but you have a really great set of, especially, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3464.0800000000004s)]
*  you know, younger Republican leaders, folks like Josh Hawley, like Bernie Moreno, like Jim Banks, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3469.92s)]
*  who are being very outspoken and effective advocates for it. And so, unlike in the past, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3477.76s)]
*  there is a Washington that is actually supportive of it. And then there's what you would call the [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3485.36s)]
*  blob. And the blob obviously hates all of it. Is the blob, is it your sense, is the blob getting [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3489.92s)]
*  less powerful or more effective and organized? Oh, I think the blob is getting much less powerful. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3499.04s)]
*  Good. That's my sense, too. Yeah, I think it's, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3506.24s)]
*  partly, there is more division within it. You know, I was describing some of the things that [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3510.24s)]
*  someone like a Janet Yellen or a Paul Krugman has said recently. It is starting to dawn on folks [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3514.88s)]
*  that the status quo just is not defensible. And it's funny to see the kind of ridicule argument [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3521.84s)]
*  flip to the other way. At some point, standing up and just being like, free trade with China is great, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3527.84s)]
*  is now the position that's subject to ridicule. And if there's anyone who cares about ridicule, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3533.1200000000003s)]
*  it's the blob. And so, that's actually very powerful. And then I also think there's just [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3538.1600000000003s)]
*  a way in which, you know, one thing that Trump is demonstrating, that folks like Vance and Rubio [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3546.1600000000003s)]
*  have demonstrated, is that the blob just doesn't have power over you. That the blob has been so [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3552.48s)]
*  discredited by everything that has gotten wrong, that when the blob tries to apply its ridicule to [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3560.48s)]
*  a JD Vance, right? To the, like, forget about them talking to each other, to the extent that it's just [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3568.56s)]
*  performative for the rest of America. America's not going like, oh, well, this former State [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3573.68s)]
*  Department official, you know, says JD Vance is wrong. I guess JD Vance is wrong. They're going [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3579.04s)]
*  like, is this the former State Department official who got us into Iraq? The one who screwed up the [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3584.48s)]
*  Afghanistan withdrawal or the one that embraced China, right? And so, look, there are some ways [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3591.84s)]
*  in which it's a huge problem for the country that our experts have been so discredited. It would be [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3597.44s)]
*  nice to have credible experts, but to the extent that it's happened, I think it just does not have [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3603.6s)]
*  the same political power that it used to. So what, just to go back to your amazing point, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3609.92s)]
*  sorry, you've got a dog there. Oh, welcome. Hey, Al. A tariff supporter, I think. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3616.7999999999997s)]
*  Tariff supporter. Sorry, you were nice to the dog in the way and your marks for life. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3622.08s)]
*  Your amazing point that these were post-war institutions, self-consciously designed [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3627.12s)]
*  to keep order. How has that worked? Like leaving a site, and there's really no debate in this room [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3635.44s)]
*  anyway about the effects on the United States. Look at it. It didn't work for us. Did it work [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3642.96s)]
*  for the world? And do we risk conflict by abandoning it? That's a really good question. I mean, there's [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3647.52s)]
*  so one way in which it obviously did work for the world is that it obviously worked for hundreds of [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3656.8s)]
*  millions of Chinese subsistence farmers who have now benefited from China's growth. And China is the [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3662.56s)]
*  top example, but lots of countries have benefited from this system and to the extent that the US [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3670.48s)]
*  was happy to kind of be the consumer for other countries as they developed. In some ways, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3677.6800000000003s)]
*  we obviously benefited from getting to consume a lot of stuff too. So I think it's important, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3683.6s)]
*  certainly, to acknowledge that. And I think it's even important to say, good US policy, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3691.12s)]
*  America first policy isn't America only policy. I think we should want to have policy that lifts [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3695.7599999999998s)]
*  other people up when we can. But I think it's important to be honest about the tradeoffs and [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3702.24s)]
*  say, look, if we do X, this could have this great effect. It's also going to have this cost and who's [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3706.96s)]
*  bearing the cost. So there have been those benefits. I think during the Cold War era, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3712.96s)]
*  there was obviously enormous benefit in defeating the Soviet Union. I mean, in that sort of an [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3722.2400000000002s)]
*  existential conflict, holding together the American alliance, making sure that it was seeing broadly [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3728.4s)]
*  shared prosperity within it, proving that markets could work better than communism. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3738.48s)]
*  Those were all extremely important things. And by the way, it did work. We did win the Cold War. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3745.36s)]
*  I mean, that's always the one piece of credit I will give the market fundamentalists as I'm [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3750.48s)]
*  decrying them. The reason this became the standard economic thinking on the right of center [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3756.0s)]
*  is because Reagan brought it in. Reagan said, my coalition is this kind of free market economic [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3762.0s)]
*  thinking, even as he himself was not a fundamentalist on it, the more traditional social [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3769.52s)]
*  conservatism and the Cold War hawks. And what actually did all those folks have in common? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3775.28s)]
*  They hated communism and gosh darn it, they succeeded. And so it's very important to give [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3781.28s)]
*  that its due. I think where things go off the rails is once you don't have that existential [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3788.72s)]
*  threat anymore. And you see it in the foreign policy context too, right? Where all those hawks [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3794.7999999999997s)]
*  are now like, well, let's go find other wars to start in ways that are neither conservative nor [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3798.9599999999996s)]
*  good for the nation. And the economic folks say, well, great, how can we continue to carry this [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3805.04s)]
*  further? Well, now we need the WTO, now we need free trade with China and on and on. And so I think [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3811.6s)]
*  it's the classic pendulum swing from something that a world of no trade isn't a good world either. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3817.76s)]
*  Some good ideas were introduced, they did accomplish some things and then it just [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3826.8s)]
*  kept on swinging all the way to the other side. And that's where I think we got stuck and where [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3831.2000000000003s)]
*  it's now very helpful to see we've dislodged it and we're swinging it back. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3840.8s)]
*  Specifically on China, and they were open about it in the early 70s when Nixon famously went to [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3847.04s)]
*  China, that this will be good for the world because it will de-radicalize China, which is the height [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3854.48s)]
*  of the Cultural Revolution when he said that. So pulling back from that and starting a trade [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3861.36s)]
*  war with China, does that increase the chance of a conflict, a military conflict with China? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3868.08s)]
*  I don't think so. I think other things have increased the chances of conflict. The fact [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3874.64s)]
*  that since the year 2000, China rather than liberalizing has become more authoritarian [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3879.6s)]
*  with more expansionist ambitions with a massive military buildup, that makes it more likely that [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3886.3199999999997s)]
*  we're going to have a conflict. But I think one of the key failures of the blob is that it always [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3892.48s)]
*  tends to live in the world as they wish it were, rather than the world as it is. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3900.3199999999997s)]
*  I wish we were in a world where China had liberalized. That sounds great, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3907.12s)]
*  but we don't. I wish we lived in a world where the US was still the superpower that could [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3911.12s)]
*  essentially dictate terms. When we did a bad job, that was bad, but all things considered, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3918.64s)]
*  it would be great for the United States to be- [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3924.4s)]
*  You want your country to be on top. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3925.6s)]
*  Absolutely. But that's just not the world anymore. It's not a question of should, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3926.8s)]
*  it's a question of is. In the world that we have, the idea that higher levels of trade with China [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3933.1200000000003s)]
*  is what's going to diffuse conflict, that's just a cliche that people say. You know who had really [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3941.52s)]
*  close relationships in trade? France and Germany and the UK before World War I and World War II. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3949.52s)]
*  This idea that countries that trade don't go to war with each other isn't actually a thing. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3957.2s)]
*  Conversely, when we entirely decoupled from the Soviet Union, we had a war that stayed [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3963.68s)]
*  cold. I think the United States needs to make its decisions about the economic relationship with [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3971.04s)]
*  China pretty much independently, not believe that one choice versus the other is the way that [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3978.64s)]
*  we're going to manage the foreign relations. All things considered, I think our best chance of [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3984.4s)]
*  maintaining stable, peaceful foreign relations is to make clear that we are, first of all, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3989.68s)]
*  is to re-industrialize and make sure that we are capable of deterring China. But then also to make [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=3998.08s)]
*  very clear that we are not going to buy into this gobbledygook, that we are going to be realists [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4005.2s)]
*  and we are going to look at the world as it is. One element of that is not to pretend that you [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4010.72s)]
*  can have free trade with an authoritarian communist regime. How does the tariff story end? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4016.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know, end, but in the next five years we're clearly going to have some kind of economic [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4022.7999999999997s)]
*  reset. People will get poorer, that's kind of guaranteed, I think. I expect it anyway. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4027.68s)]
*  Do we evolve past that and become more prosperous and more cohesive? How does the story end? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4032.08s)]
*  I think we do. I think the best way to understand what's going on is to think about this kind of [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4039.44s)]
*  world order that we've been talking about a bunch and recognize that what we are going through is a [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4046.64s)]
*  transition out of US as sole superpower to, I guess you would call it a multipolar world, where [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4051.44s)]
*  China is a kind of peer competitor and adversary. Secretary of State Rubio has actually been talking [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4059.44s)]
*  about this a lot. All of the assumptions we made, we've been talking about the foreign policy case [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4066.6400000000003s)]
*  for free trade, in a world where the US was the power, you could make a case that it was [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4072.4s)]
*  worth accepting these various costs for sort of maintaining that status. In the world where it is [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4079.1200000000003s)]
*  no longer, we're seeing in real time how it breaks down, how you can't just be the benevolent open [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4085.52s)]
*  market when China is now bigger than you and more technologically advanced in some ways and [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4092.0s)]
*  it can't go on that way. I think the tariffs are the sort of tip of the spear of saying [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4099.84s)]
*  that system is over, what do we want to have replace it? I think what the United States should [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4108.0s)]
*  want and what I see the administration pointing toward and pushing toward is basically, look, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4115.68s)]
*  we still want to have strong allies. We still want to have free trade among our allies. When I was [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4121.2s)]
*  talking about that idea, if you have a tariff on the outside, you can have a freer market on the [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4126.72s)]
*  inside. Ideally, that's not just the US alone. Ideally, that goes for a set of countries that [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4132.08s)]
*  actually are market democracies and do want to play by the rules. What the US is doing with the [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4138.72s)]
*  tariffs is saying, look, the open season, everyone does whatever they want and unconditionally gets [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4145.2s)]
*  benefits of American defense, American market, that's over. New system, we would like to have [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4151.5199999999995s)]
*  strong alliances and relationships and low tariffs, but there are now conditions. Condition one [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4158.96s)]
*  is balanced trade. Again, that's this idea that free trade is great if you're actually trading [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4166.32s)]
*  stuff for stuff and you're doing it in a way that fits with the economic model where it's supposed [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4172.56s)]
*  to work. Countries that have been basically taking the most valuable industries for themselves and [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4177.92s)]
*  just selling to us, that's over. Piece number two, on the defense side, everybody needs to [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4184.56s)]
*  pull their own weight and actually lead in their own areas. You want to deter Russia? Germany, go [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4192.88s)]
*  figure out what you need to do to deter Russia. You want to deter China? Japan, go figure out what [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4198.320000000001s)]
*  you need to do. Don't be looking over your shoulder, sort of, have I done enough homework to go outside [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4202.320000000001s)]
*  and play? Like, actually get it done. It's actually interesting you see the Trump administration, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4207.200000000001s)]
*  Stephen Mirren, who's the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, gave a very good speech [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4213.52s)]
*  talking about what are we actually looking for in these negotiations. He said this is economic and [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4218.56s)]
*  security. These are not separate conversations. This is a question of whether you are in for both. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4224.32s)]
*  By the way, one way you could balance your trade with us would be to buy a whole bunch of American [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4231.76s)]
*  weapons and pay us for the security services we provide because it ain't going to be free anymore. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4237.04s)]
*  And then piece three is China is out. More like in the Cold War system, you can't have these sort [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4243.4400000000005s)]
*  of entangled systems where, okay, the US doesn't want Chinese supply chains, so they just go set [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4250.8s)]
*  up in Mexico and it comes in through Mexico. And this is actually, I think, why Trump started the [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4257.36s)]
*  way he did with Mexico and Canada. Mexico and Canada, with the US, you should be the core of [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4264.56s)]
*  this alliance we're talking about, but you need to understand that it can't work the way it's been [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4269.36s)]
*  working. It's going to have to work on these terms. And so you see someone like Treasury Secretary [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4275.5199999999995s)]
*  Scott Besson specifically saying, Mexico, we need to see the same tariffs toward China that we're [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4281.44s)]
*  putting toward China. Canada, we need to see that same policy because it can't be a screen door. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4287.28s)]
*  I mean, I think it's dawning on a lot of people that China has enormous influence over the [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4295.52s)]
*  political structures of Canada and China, particularly Canada. In some real way, it kind [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4300.72s)]
*  of controls Canada. So is it too late to bring those two countries into... [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4308.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's too late. And the funny thing about this sort of set of demands, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4315.92s)]
*  is that the blob gets very uncomfortable with this. You'll drive these people into China's arms. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4322.08s)]
*  And you actually step back and you look at it objectively and you say, this isn't some [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4329.68s)]
*  exploitative client tribute regime. This is a set of demands, which by the way, we hold ourselves to. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4334.32s)]
*  We are not asking them to switch to a trade relationship where we get all the advantages. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4342.88s)]
*  We're just asking for a balanced one. We're not asking them to pay for our defense. We're [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4347.68s)]
*  just asking them to do their fair share. We're not asking them to keep China out so we get all the [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4352.08s)]
*  fun with China. We're saying we all need to keep China out. And while there are obviously a lot of [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4357.120000000001s)]
*  people who are very sore at the moment with how they're being treated by the Trump administration, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4362.56s)]
*  anybody who actually steps back and looks at this, if you are a market democracy that wants [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4369.04s)]
*  to remain a market democracy, this is your chance. By the way, not only are these not [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4373.6s)]
*  unreasonable demands, these things are good for you. You should want to be moving to balanced [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4379.6s)]
*  trade. You should want to have the will to get China out. And the US is frankly helping you [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4383.280000000001s)]
*  by giving you a way to go in your own domestic politics to say, look, we can't keep pursuing [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4389.6s)]
*  this compromised relationship partly with China. If we don't get real about this, we are going to [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4396.0s)]
*  end up outside of the US perimeter and then stuck with China. And I think whether it's Canada and [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4404.4s)]
*  Mexico, Japan, India, Australia, Korea, we've already seen with the UK now the start of a deal, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4410.96s)]
*  I think that's sort of a no-brainer. I think the one where it's hard is Europe. I think Europe is [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4419.92s)]
*  probably more compromised. They've shown more willingness already to just take the short-term [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4425.76s)]
*  gain. The crazy thing is the group most opposed to keeping cheap Chinese cars out [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4433.04s)]
*  is the German automakers because they want to make five more years of money in China before [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4439.360000000001s)]
*  they get thrown out of there. And so I don't know if Europe has the civilizational will. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4444.56s)]
*  I don't know if they have the understanding of their interests. And because of the way the EU [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4451.2s)]
*  is structured, I don't even know if they have the... This is something that could also pretty [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4455.36s)]
*  much break apart the EU. You could have some countries that say, well, wait a minute. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4459.28s)]
*  We do want that deal with the US. And if we can't get that through the EU, then the EU doesn't work [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4464.16s)]
*  anymore. That's where I think you're going to see the most tension. And then you'll see countries [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4470.639999999999s)]
*  that are going to be in China's sphere, right? Pakistan. I think a country like Vietnam is a [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4475.2s)]
*  very interesting question, which direction they might go. At the end of the day, the idea isn't [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4481.04s)]
*  that we are going to be able to get the whole world to gang up on and oppress China. The idea [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4486.08s)]
*  is that we're going to be in a world with two powers that have two very different economic and [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4491.36s)]
*  political systems and different spheres of influence. Boy, that is best case if we wind up there. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4495.5199999999995s)]
*  And that goes back to the question about, well, but isn't this going to start a war or whatever? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4501.84s)]
*  It's like, no, this is the best case. This is the formula for actually having, I think, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4506.64s)]
*  a much more sustainable equilibrium. Yeah, like a peaceful multipolar world. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4511.04s)]
*  Yes. Which by the way, we've had for all of history, you know, up until it ended in 1991. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4515.84s)]
*  Well, and that's such an important point that people keep raising this as like, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4522.400000000001s)]
*  what is this strange, unprecedented thing that the crazy Donald Trump is doing? It's like, no, no, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4526.64s)]
*  first of all, this literally was US policy for the Cold War, right? And not to mention, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4533.52s)]
*  this was the way foreign affairs always worked for however many hundred years before the Cold [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4538.56s)]
*  War. It is only people who think the world started in 1991 that don't understand what is happening. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4543.04s)]
*  The problem though, is like a deeper problem. And I pray it's resolvable, but it's like, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4547.6s)]
*  how do you pull back from hegemony? How do you scale back an empire without becoming Great Britain? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4553.36s)]
*  Yes. Well, and that goes to your question about sort of the costs, because there obviously are [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4561.84s)]
*  costs here. You know, some of them are the sort of direct just consumer costs. If you were relying [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4566.400000000001s)]
*  on cheap stuff from China, you don't want to do that anymore. At least in the short run, there's [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4572.96s)]
*  going to be higher cost. I think in the medium to nine is just like the well someday, but you know, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4577.92s)]
*  within the five to 10 year window, you actually see the benefits overwhelm that you see that [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4585.2s)]
*  if you actually return to an economic model that does encourage domestic investment, that does focus [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4591.68s)]
*  on, you know, prosperity in places that aren't just a few big cities that is oriented toward [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4597.200000000001s)]
*  creating good jobs for everybody, you actually get more growth that way. I mean, the dirty secret of [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4604.0s)]
*  this post Cold War period, so we're supposed to take globalization and efficiency and growth, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4611.360000000001s)]
*  growth just keeps getting slower. No, I know. Investment keeps going down. In manufacturing, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4616.16s)]
*  productivity has actually turned negative, which should not be possible in a capitalist economy. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4621.84s)]
*  We are literally getting worse at making things. You need more labor in an American factory today [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4628.32s)]
*  than a decade ago for the same amount of output. And so this just isn't working. And going back to [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4633.76s)]
*  the kind of economic model that did drive our prosperity for so long, I think will be much [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4641.2s)]
*  better. The point about what happens after empire, that's bigger than the than the economic question. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4646.639999999999s)]
*  If this were just about the numbers and the production, I think you can see a very clear way [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4653.679999999999s)]
*  out the social and political and cultural question of what does the United States become? Can it [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4658.639999999999s)]
*  return to the idea of a republic as in fact, far superior to and more desirable than an empire? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4665.28s)]
*  On paper, that sounds great. It shouldn't be a problem at all. In practice, for anyone who [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4674.0s)]
*  studied history knows no one has ever really stuck that landing. And that is the challenge we have. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4678.88s)]
*  Why do you think? I think probably for a lot of the reasons we're seeing now in our politics, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4685.679999999999s)]
*  which is that for the political class, for people who run things, going from empire back to republic [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4694.0s)]
*  is not desirable. That the entire push toward empire, then the push toward sort of globalism [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4699.36s)]
*  is a better end state if you are the emperor. If you are that set of people. And for me, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4708.48s)]
*  ultimately, this is kind of the best way of understanding populism. Because I think everyone [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4718.4s)]
*  agrees something like populism is happening, right? And it is used often in a very sort of [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4724.4s)]
*  derogatory way. Like, oh, populism means, you know, just telling the masses what they want to hear [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4731.44s)]
*  or ignoring experts or something like this. Certainly, there are plenty of bad forms of [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4736.719999999999s)]
*  populism. But I think at its core, what, particularly in a democracy, what populism means [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4742.32s)]
*  is that you have a situation where the elected representatives and the other elites, people with [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4749.44s)]
*  power in the society, are no longer fulfilling their own obligation, which is to use that power [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4756.16s)]
*  on behalf of everybody. That they, in fact, have a privilege to be in those positions. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4763.04s)]
*  And with that comes the obligation to rule not just in their own interest, but in the interest of [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4768.16s)]
*  the entire nation. And when they lose sight of that, when they think, well, now that we have [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4774.48s)]
*  attained these positions, it is for us to do what is best for us. The response to that is a populism [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4780.639999999999s)]
*  that's entirely healthy. It's to say, well, if the people who are in charge are not going to act on [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4787.12s)]
*  behalf of everybody, we are no longer interested in having those people in charge. And frankly, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4792.64s)]
*  we will take anybody at all, if they at least will start with that commitment that we are here to act [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4799.280000000001s)]
*  on behalf of the broader interest. And so I think what's so, you know, what's so encouraging about [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4804.320000000001s)]
*  the US situation. That is, what you just said is like, that's the heart of it right there. I think, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4809.280000000001s)]
*  I think it is. And I, it really dawned on me speaking to the faculty of a university recently, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4813.84s)]
*  who were like, extremely, like, they don't understand what's going on at all. And, you know, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4818.96s)]
*  not talking about elected officials, just talking about the university as a university saying, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4824.08s)]
*  look, like you guys are a sort of quasi public institution, you sort of have a, you know, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4827.84s)]
*  operate in the public trust. And at some point in the last 20 years, you just decided you don't [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4832.88s)]
*  actually have to run this place in the interest of the nation anymore. You're going to run it in the [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4838.32s)]
*  like interest of yourself and your friends. And your policies are going to be the ones that you [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4842.88s)]
*  like best, not the ones that are best for everybody. And so like, yeah, like either [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4847.84s)]
*  you self correct somehow. And when I don't see that happening, or this gets done to you. And, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4854.400000000001s)]
*  and that is a natural and necessary step. And if, if there's a reason to be optimistic for the US, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4860.8s)]
*  I think it's to contrast what is going on in the US with what is going on, let's say in Europe, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4868.0s)]
*  where for all of our political problems, our political system is actually proving itself to [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4873.28s)]
*  be extremely flexible and extremely robust. I mean, it is actually responding to what people want. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4879.759999999999s)]
*  Yes. And it is bringing new leaders with different ideas and those P and it has been painful and [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4886.88s)]
*  messy, but the ship is in fact turning. You contrast that to what's going on in Europe, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4893.92s)]
*  where you have frankly among the population, a very similar set of frustrations and desires. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4899.04s)]
*  And you have that political class at the top banning political parties. And this is why I [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4904.48s)]
*  think JD Vance's speech at the Munich Security Conference was so important. And it gets exactly [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4911.04s)]
*  to the heart of what is going on, of what the Trump administration represents in this respect, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4916.16s)]
*  where he was saying, look, the biggest problem that we all have here isn't some external [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4921.04s)]
*  adversary. It is our own capacity to actually navigate these challenges. And probably better [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4927.04s)]
*  than any country in history, for reasons that is driving the blob, the elite, absolutely nuts, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4933.92s)]
*  the US is actually showing some ability to respond. And if we can pull that off, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4940.4s)]
*  that would be pretty exciting. It would be amazing. And I agree with every word you've said, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4946.48s)]
*  and said so well. My last question refers back to what you first said, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4950.72s)]
*  which is about the point of the system, which is to encourage and support and sustain healthy [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4956.88s)]
*  families and bright-eyed, impressive children who continue on the civilization. I don't think any [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4963.76s)]
*  person could disagree with that. And thank you for reminding us of it. What are specific policy [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4970.320000000001s)]
*  changes in the next five years that could help that? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4976.4s)]
*  It's a great question. And I think it's important to think about it expansively, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4982.0s)]
*  because it's great that we now have a quote, family policy discussion in the US. But a lot [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4986.799999999999s)]
*  of the times it is basically a, well, how big should the child tax credit be? Exactly. Discussion. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4992.799999999999s)]
*  And to be clear, that is an important piece of it. And this goes back to the boomer discussion [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=4998.48s)]
*  as well. We have a system of taxation and distribution in this country that overwhelmingly [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5003.12s)]
*  brings resources to retired people. I've noticed. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5010.08s)]
*  And I don't think we should stop giving resources to retired people. I think the fact that we have [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5015.68s)]
*  Medicare, the fact that we have social security are great things. But if there's any group to whom we [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5020.64s)]
*  should be focusing resources on, it is families raising kids who are the ones who have been, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5027.36s)]
*  I think, most squeezed by these economic changes. And I don't think we should believe, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5033.44s)]
*  oh, well, if we manage to get them more resources through some sort of child benefit or child tax [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5038.88s)]
*  credit, that's going to make people have more kids in the short run. I don't think that works [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5046.08s)]
*  very well. I don't think we want to be in the business of saying, well, if we pay you a little [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5052.88s)]
*  more, will you have another kid? But what it will do is make the experience of being a family raising [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5057.12s)]
*  kids better. And in the culture, it will begin to shift what it feels like to be doing that and what [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5064.4800000000005s)]
*  people see about people who are doing that. Not this constant struggle and getting squeezed, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5070.4800000000005s)]
*  but a little more something that is actually viable and desirable and that we all have committed [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5077.76s)]
*  to supporting. And so both for the sake of the families and for the sake of the culture, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5083.52s)]
*  I think that does make a big difference. I also think it's important to note that we will have [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5088.56s)]
*  to pay for that. And the people who will pay for it are the people who are earning a lot of money and [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5093.76s)]
*  don't have kids, which is the direction of distribution we should be leaning toward. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5098.56s)]
*  More broadly, I think then, and this is great that we're sort of landing back here. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5104.8s)]
*  I love that you said that out loud. What? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5111.360000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, the people who will pay for that are the people who are earning a lot and don't [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5114.72s)]
*  have kids, but they're the ones who are constantly saying, well, I don't have kids. So like, why [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5117.92s)]
*  should I have to pay for other people's kids? Right. To which you'd say what? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5124.24s)]
*  Because that is your obligation as a citizen of the nation. And it is all our obligation [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5128.88s)]
*  to raise the next generation of kids. And whether someone is not called to do that, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5134.8s)]
*  whether someone is not able to do that, not everybody is going to be doing that. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5139.4400000000005s)]
*  But the idea that you can disavow it and say, not my problem is just not true. I mean, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5143.28s)]
*  there are very specific like math and demographic related reasons it is your problem. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5148.64s)]
*  But you're making a moral case. You're making a case about the obligations of citizenship. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5153.6s)]
*  Yes. And I would say, you know, it's very interesting whenever you talk about an [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5157.52s)]
*  obligation, the question is like, well, where does that come from? Like, well, just because like, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5161.4400000000005s)]
*  somebody said it. And so I do think you have to attach it to something. And I think it attaches [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5164.8s)]
*  to two things. One is this obligation of citizenship and the idea that if, you know, in so far as you [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5169.84s)]
*  think you are better off living in America than like having been dropped naked in a jungle somewhere, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5176.4800000000005s)]
*  like you didn't, you know, you didn't cause America to come into being yourself. You are part of this [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5182.16s)]
*  larger system that if you want to benefit from, you probably need to contribute to. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5189.68s)]
*  But then also broadly, I have these crazy ideas. The more specifically, you know, you as an [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5195.92s)]
*  individual came from somewhere, like you're only here because some other people actually [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5203.12s)]
*  chose to take the time and dedicate their life to having and raising you. And so, you know, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5208.88s)]
*  either you could say like, well, I'm just going to like stick that in my pocket and go on vacation [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5216.400000000001s)]
*  to Greece, or you can't pay it back. You can never repay your parents for what they gave you. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5220.400000000001s)]
*  The only thing you can do is pay it forward and do the next thing, the same thing for [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5228.88s)]
*  the next generation. So- Whether they're yours or not. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5234.08s)]
*  Whether they're yours, that's absolutely right. And if they can be yours, ideally they will be. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5237.280000000001s)]
*  And if everybody says, well, I'll just support somebody else's, obviously it doesn't work. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5243.6s)]
*  But I think that's the sort of dual individual and communal commitment that supports all of this. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5249.6s)]
*  And so that's just, you know, we talked about the kind of narrow family policy of [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5256.72s)]
*  tax policy and- I can see why you're successful because you say these [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5261.04s)]
*  radically countercultural things with a kind of like, of course, you know. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5265.360000000001s)]
*  It's just putting ideas out there for whoever wants to pick them up. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5270.08s)]
*  So when you go back to Harvard and you say stuff like that, how do people respond? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5275.44s)]
*  It's an interesting question. I actually just did a talk at Yale Law School about this. And [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5279.84s)]
*  one of the really things that's interesting that's going on with younger conservatives [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5286.64s)]
*  is that they are very attuned to this. Yes, that is true. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5290.8s)]
*  There's an extraordinary divide, sort of really once you're under 40, certainly once you're under [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5294.48s)]
*  30, you've just grown up in such a different context that the Cold War or Reagan-style [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5300.96s)]
*  conservatism makes no sense. And the things we've been talking about here are just much [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5305.36s)]
*  more responsive to the problems you see out in the world. The funny flip side of it then is that you [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5309.839999999999s)]
*  always get the few progressives who want to sort of come show up. And to your point about like, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5315.839999999999s)]
*  well, nobody could disagree with this. In fact, you will have the few progressives who [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5321.84s)]
*  either somehow think this must be a conversation about gay marriage somehow, even if they're not [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5329.12s)]
*  sure how, but they would like it to be. Or they will just more broadly sort of try to [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5336.96s)]
*  interpret the principles as by implication, oppressing some outgroup. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5345.92s)]
*  I mean, look, that's sort of the core of progressivism. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5354.4s)]
*  But there's only one template. I mean, there's other things going on that don't affect the trans [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5356.96s)]
*  community. Come on, stop. Well, even just, you know, this goes to the question of rights and [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5361.04s)]
*  privileges versus duties and obligations. Like part of the reason progressives get very uncomfortable [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5366.64s)]
*  with that side of the discussion is because, well, like, wait a minute, that you just like [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5373.36s)]
*  infringed on something. And so there's a lot of, especially in a place like Yale Law School, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5380.799999999999s)]
*  there's a lot of sensitivity to like, well, what, like, who, like, who are you infringing on with [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5386.16s)]
*  this view? And the answer is like, everybody. Like, to be clear, I am an equal opportunity [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5390.88s)]
*  infringer on, I value liberty and would like to protect it, but I am an equal opportunity [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5400.96s)]
*  infringer on all liberty to the extent that it is being claimed to the exclusion of all of these [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5407.04s)]
*  other things that matter too, if we are going to have a society and a civilization at all. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5414.24s)]
*  And it's, that is in my mind, what conservatism meant for most of modern Western history. And [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5420.64s)]
*  it's very exciting that a lot of people are now focused on it again. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5430.72s)]
*  I can't improve on that. Oren Kast, thank you. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5435.76s)]
*  This was so much fun. Amazing. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5438.08s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5445.2s)]
*  that's what they do. But on another level, it's shocking with everything that's going on in the [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5450.08s)]
*  world right now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5453.84s)]
*  on the cusp of fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5458.96s)]
*  rather than more. And that is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5464.16s)]
*  we could whine about it. That's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5470.8s)]
*  way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5474.56s)]
*  deceptive. The way to do that on YouTube, we think, it's to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5479.36s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5484.64s)]
*  a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hVEPze1rI&t=5489.84s)]
