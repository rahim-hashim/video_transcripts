# Tucker’s Ultimate Nicotine Pouch Taste Test
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A)
*  That smells like sh** actually. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=3.64s)]
*  It's absolutely awful. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Like absolutely, that's like the worst smell I've ever smelled. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  It's really bad. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  It's really bad. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  I don't know really try it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  It's good for the climate. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Oh f**k you Zim. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=15.64s)]
*  Nobody works at the company who uses nicotine patches. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=16.84s)]
*  I'm kind of like a living lab rat right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=19.44s)]
*  Like what happens if you really go all the way? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=23.28s)]
*  I'm Tucker Carlson and I like nicotine. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=25.48s)]
*  One of the keys to life I think is being honest about what you know. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=33.52s)]
*  Can you give a two hour talk on copper mining in Congo? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=36.64s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=40.24s)]
*  But if you ask me what I think of nicotine, I have an informed answer because I am a lifelong [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=41.24s)]
*  over 40 year nicotine user. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=45.6s)]
*  After a lifetime of testing, I've arrived now at Alp nicotine pouches. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  We created Alp pouch because we know what we're talking about when we talk about nicotine. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=53.44s)]
*  But it dawned on me the other day, this could be the moment for a nicotine tasting. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=59.0s)]
*  As I just said, I'm not just a casual user. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=63.16s)]
*  I'm a nicotine sommelier. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=65.96s)]
*  So today we're going to go through the entire gamut of commercially available nicotine pouches [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=68.4s)]
*  in the United States and we're going to compare them to the product that we make, Alp pouch. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=74.1s)]
*  We're going to be donning a white glove as a sommelier would and the purpose of this, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=78.36s)]
*  and it's just on my left hand, I'm left handed, is to make sure it's fair. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=83.16s)]
*  I don't want to pollute the taste of any of these pouches with oils on my hands. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=86.64s)]
*  That's how serious we are. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=92.68s)]
*  So let's start out with what we make. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=94.32s)]
*  This is Alp tropical fruit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=98.68s)]
*  This is one of my favorite flavors. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=100.84s)]
*  I on a day to day basis, I use nine milligram, but we're going to hit the median here with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=102.12s)]
*  six and I mix these actually with wintergrain. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=105.84s)]
*  I put two tins together and I kind of like they marinate together and create something [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=108.76s)]
*  kind of special, but we're going to try it alone today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=113.4s)]
*  It's not that easy with a white gloves, but the white gloves are worth it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=115.72s)]
*  Now before people always do the upper deck or lower deck, whatever, but I like to swirl [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  it around in my mouth, front of the tongue, back of the tongue, roof of the mouth, palate, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=123.12s)]
*  even honestly under the tongue, different parts of your mouth react to flavor in different [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  ways. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=133.0s)]
*  So you want the whole picture. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=134.0s)]
*  You want the full 360 degree profile of the flavor. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=135.0s)]
*  Mm. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=138.24s)]
*  Mm. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=139.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  Next up is number six Alp wintergreen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=143.44s)]
*  As I said, I use nine, but by the way, can I say something? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  So if you're like in a duty free in another country and you see like the whole rack of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=148.36s)]
*  foreign, particularly the Russian nicotine pouches, you will see some high milligram [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  nicotine. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=157.72s)]
*  And even for me, some of it's a little bit too strong. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=158.72s)]
*  You do one of the ones with like a Russian bear on it and that's like 20 milligrams and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  whoo, our nines hit differently. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=164.08s)]
*  It's a slower release. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  It's not, you know, blowing your out of your chair. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=168.08s)]
*  Okay, so that's, that's a really good product that that a lot of testing went into that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=171.96s)]
*  flavor. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=175.84s)]
*  It's got the astringence of mint. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=176.84s)]
*  You want a certain bite to it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  You can't have a flat mint. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=180.12s)]
*  The whole point of mint is like, woo, mint. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  Breathe in, clears your lungs, clears out any remaining tuberculosis. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  Not making health claims here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm just noting the facts. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  This you can keep in all day. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=191.36s)]
*  The flavor stays so long in these pouches that we're almost thinking, well, wait a second. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=192.56s)]
*  If you have a product that people can keep using, they don't need to buy new products. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=197.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=200.72s)]
*  Like, so if you, if you double the amount of time someone can keep a pouch in, maybe [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=201.72s)]
*  that's like a, you know, massive loss, loss in revenue to you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  If you think about it, it doesn't have planned obsolescence built in, but we didn't care. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=208.64s)]
*  We did it anyway. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=213.0s)]
*  So this is chilled mint. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=214.0s)]
*  The other day I was actually in a car going to the airport and my driver had COVID like [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=216.32s)]
*  four years ago and he lost his sense of smell. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=220.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm not making this a true story. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=223.16s)]
*  And I open up a tin of this in the back and he goes, I can smell that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=224.52s)]
*  And I said, I'm sorry, do you not like it? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  And he goes, I haven't smelled anything in four years and I can smell whatever you just [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  opened. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=234.24s)]
*  It's the first thing I've smelled. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=235.24s)]
*  So again, not making medical claims here, but I'm just saying this cut through the COVID [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=236.24s)]
*  haze for the man who was driving me to the airport. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  You open it, I can smell it from here. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=240.84s)]
*  If you've had a really late night and I gave up late nights many years ago, but let's say [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  you're still in the late night phase of life and you have to wake up a little early to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=246.52s)]
*  get to the job. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=250.4s)]
*  Throw one of these puppies in. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=251.4s)]
*  Woo! [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=252.4s)]
*  Bracing, but delicious. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=255.36s)]
*  They're definitely bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, reporting for work, sir, kind of nicotine [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=257.24s)]
*  pouches. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=262.48s)]
*  Very, very good. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=263.48s)]
*  This is the next flavor of Alp. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=264.68s)]
*  It's called Refreshing Chill. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=266.04s)]
*  What is Refreshing Chill? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=267.66s)]
*  What flavor is that? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=269.02000000000004s)]
*  Oh, good question. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=270.36s)]
*  It's no flavor. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=272.14s)]
*  Now, why do we make a nicotine pouch with no flavor? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=273.14s)]
*  Well, because we're required by law to do that by the state of California, which has [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  decided having solved all of its other problems, the tens of millions of people living there [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=279.6s)]
*  illegally, drug cartels running at cities, the mass shootings, the fentanyl ODs, feces-covered [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=283.08s)]
*  nature of San Francisco. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=289.24s)]
*  And that's why I'm launching a new podcast. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=290.56s)]
*  Having solved all of that, they're going to protect their citizens from the real threat, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  which is flavored nicotine pouches. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=297.2s)]
*  So you cannot sell a flavored nicotine pouch in California. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=298.36s)]
*  That's how progressive it is. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=301.68s)]
*  It's so progressive, it's just like Stalinist. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=302.68s)]
*  But we're not giving up on our biggest state. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=304.52s)]
*  I'm from California, so I feel a certain familial loyalty to the state. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  So we produced this product, Refreshing Chill. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=310.88000000000005s)]
*  And it is actually, it is refreshing and it's chilly. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  You're going to want to wear a sweater for this one. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=316.92s)]
*  Welcome back to Nicotine Tasting Hour with Tucker Carlson, the White Glove Nicotine Sommelier. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=322.32000000000005s)]
*  We've gone through some of the selection that our company, Alp, offers. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=329.24s)]
*  We started there as a kind of baseline. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  How do the other products compare to the one that we're offering? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  We go first to a company called Zyn, a kind of politically charged, very sensitive, very [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=339.08s)]

*  Now, I'll just be totally honest, obviously I've thrown a lot of shade at Zyn. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  I'll admit that I use Zyn for years and I did it without self-consciousness, really [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=349.67999999999995s)]

*  I always thought it was the best of the Zyn flavors and we're rolling out coffee mocha [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=407.62s)]
*  that's better. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=413.35999999999996s)]

*  You have to sit there and wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=420.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's fine. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=439.0s)]
*  It's good. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=440.0s)]

*  It smells good. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=444.0s)]

*  Like in your memory, it's this like big interesting place and you go back. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=447.8s)]
*  Why is it so small? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=451.6s)]
*  That's how I feel about Zyn. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=452.6s)]
*  If you had asked me, you know, a year and a half ago, what do you think is in coffee? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=455.40000000000003s)]

*  I ever dated you. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  You're kind of a loser. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  If you look far back, the Sahara Desert in July is a lot more life-giving than a Zyn. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=473.4s)]
*  Like if I pulled this out of an Egyptian tomb, I'd be like, oh, really? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=481.4s)]
*  They use nicotine pouches? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=484.79999999999995s)]
*  It's been sitting under the desert for 3000 years. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=486.09999999999997s)]
*  That's what it actually feels like. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=488.7s)]
*  This is cinnamon. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  And the other thing I will say about a dry pouch, not just Zyn, which is a uniquely crappy [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  company, but all dry pouches, you have to start it up. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=498.0s)]
*  It's like a Model T Ford. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=500.85999999999996s)]
*  You have to crank it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=501.86s)]
*  It's like, no, I'd like an automatic starter, please. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=503.5s)]
*  It's like survival food. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=505.62s)]
*  You have to add water or something or else it just sits there inert for decades or centuries [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=506.78000000000003s)]
*  or millennia. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=511.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=512.9s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=513.9s)]
*  Breakers by Lucy in Expresso. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=516.9s)]
*  Weirdly, I know the guys who run Lucy and I'd love to claim they're evil, but they're [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=519.38s)]
*  actually really, really good guys. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=523.74s)]
*  They're actually great guys. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=525.22s)]
*  I like them a lot. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=527.22s)]
*  They're also like salmon pink. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=528.38s)]
*  That's a little bizarre. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=532.36s)]
*  They actually feel like sandpaper on the outside. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=533.36s)]
*  These are kind of an interesting concept. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=538.34s)]
*  So they have a little capsule that you break with your teeth. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=540.86s)]
*  It's like one of those little cyanide capsules that, you know, spies carry, though it's not [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  cyanide in this case. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=548.1800000000001s)]
*  It's flavoring. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=549.4200000000001s)]
*  You crunch it and it makes it wet. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=550.4200000000001s)]
*  This is my favorite one of any that I've had today other than Alp. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=552.1s)]
*  This is Lucy Mango. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=556.02s)]
*  15 pouches. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=558.18s)]
*  That's five too short in my opinion. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=559.66s)]
*  These are not Breakers. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=561.62s)]
*  These are conventional Lucy's. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=562.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=563.62s)]
*  It's not terrible, but it's like really like what are we doing here? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=564.62s)]
*  Like what's the point of being alive? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=572.6999999999999s)]
*  Like the point of being alive is to create something beautiful, to do something really [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=575.14s)]
*  great and lasting. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=578.54s)]
*  Dusty Springfield, who was a totally screwed up, you know, drug addicted British singer [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=580.14s)]
*  in the 1960s. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=586.86s)]
*  Life amounts to nothing. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=588.54s)]
*  Died young, but she wrote one song that's less than three minutes long. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=589.86s)]
*  It's called Son of a Preacher. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=593.34s)]
*  And there's not one person who hasn't heard that song and said, you know, that's a great [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=594.34s)]
*  song. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=597.06s)]
*  So Dusty Springfield's whole life had meaning and her name is remembered. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=598.06s)]
*  And we're talking about her now because she created this one thing less than three minutes [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=601.86s)]
*  long of beauty. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=604.9s)]
*  And so if you're in the business of making things, no matter what, do your best, make [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=606.44s)]
*  it great. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  And they didn't do that with Lucy, the number of four mangoes. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=611.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=614.24s)]
*  People are like, gosh, you've tried a lot of different nicotine brands. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=615.24s)]
*  Say, are you tired? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=617.96s)]
*  Am I tired? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=618.96s)]
*  I feel great. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=619.96s)]
*  I don't know how many milligrams of nicotine my blood contains right now, but a lot. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=620.96s)]
*  I'll just say a lot. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  And I'm kind of like a living lab rat right now. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  Like what happens if you really go all the way? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=631.5600000000001s)]
*  Honestly, I feel great. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=633.8000000000001s)]
*  I feel totally aware. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=635.0s)]
*  I feel happy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=636.12s)]
*  I don't feel like I'm in math. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=637.12s)]
*  You know, I'm not like, whoa, I'm Napoleon. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=638.12s)]
*  I just feel like clear headed, cheerful. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=639.96s)]
*  Mental acuity is at least at 10, if not 11. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=644.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, this is kind of interesting. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=648.12s)]
*  This is called. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=650.2s)]
*  With an exclamation point like, oh, okay. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=654.44s)]
*  So it's on. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=660.0s)]
*  It comes with a wrapper on it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=661.0s)]
*  It's like a childproof. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know why they would put some kind of plastic wrapper on here, but whatever. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=664.76s)]
*  First thing you notice about OONs or ONs is that they are not round. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=669.92s)]
*  This is cinnamon. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=674.68s)]
*  I open it up. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=675.68s)]
*  Ooh, and look, there's caked nicotine right there. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=676.92s)]
*  It's a little bit like an illegal narcotic. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=680.04s)]
*  Now, why is there caked nicotine on the inside? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=681.88s)]
*  I have no idea why. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=684.28s)]
*  They're small. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=685.72s)]
*  They're very flimsy. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=686.72s)]
*  It almost feels like they're made of toilet paper or something. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=687.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's not bad actually. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=691.36s)]
*  Everything about the pouch itself is spells like made in Oaxaca, Mexico by people without [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=695.16s)]
*  shoes, but man, they put some powerful flavor. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=701.4799999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=704.8399999999999s)]
*  Oh, let me, let me revise that. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=706.8399999999999s)]
*  That's not good at all. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=710.04s)]
*  Maybe they are made in Mexico and their tamales in there. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=711.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=713.88s)]
*  I wouldn't keep using that product though. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=714.88s)]
*  I do like the design. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=716.76s)]
*  Honestly, I kind of like the square tin. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=717.76s)]
*  These are the same people who make Grizzly. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=719.64s)]
*  I've never actually had Grizzly chewing tobacco. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=727.88s)]
*  It was always considered like a kind of cheesy discount product. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=729.84s)]
*  It was like the generic cigarettes of chewing tobacco. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=733.48s)]
*  I never, I never actually had it, but that doesn't mean it's not great. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=735.92s)]
*  And I met people who like Grizzly a lot and I absolutely love chewing tobacco. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=738.56s)]
*  So I will give them the benefit of the doubt. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=742.1999999999999s)]
*  This is Spearmint. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=744.12s)]
*  Not clear how many pouches in here. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=746.2s)]
*  I don't think it says. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=747.76s)]
*  Oh, 20. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=748.88s)]
*  Good for them. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=749.88s)]
*  So Zen really is lagging the industry in pouches. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=750.88s)]
*  Still trying to get away with 15 pouches. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=753.24s)]
*  No, we're not screwing you over. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=754.92s)]
*  Giant Swiss creepy left-wing company. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=756.4399999999999s)]
*  No, we're not. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=759.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=760.12s)]
*  The Larry Fink of nicotine pouches. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=761.12s)]
*  No, no, no, really try it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=762.12s)]
*  It's totally good. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=763.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=764.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=765.12s)]
*  It's good for the climate. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=766.12s)]
*  Oh, f**k you, Zen. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=767.12s)]
*  They should just stick to dip. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=776.92s)]
*  You know, if you make dip, if you make dip, if you make chewing tobacco, there's nothing [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=779.28s)]
*  wrong with that. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=783.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, it's one of the products that built this country. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  The men who built our railroads and won the world wars, you know, they dipped. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=786.56s)]
*  The US military dips to this day, though a lot have switched to out, but there's nothing [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=790.52s)]
*  disreputable at dip. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=795.1999999999999s)]
*  So if you make dip, if you make Grizzly, then you should not be ashamed at all. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=796.48s)]
*  And you should just stick with what you know. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=801.0s)]
*  Stay in your lane. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=803.6s)]
*  Veer into a new category and be like, you know, we make a pretty good chewing tobacco. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=805.52s)]
*  Maybe we can make nicotine pouches. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=808.72s)]
*  The evidence suggests no, you can't. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=810.52s)]
*  No offense. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  This is called Clue Clue, like the game, like Mr. Mustard in the library, except it's spelled [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=814.8399999999999s)]
*  differently C-L-E-W. Clue. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=822.88s)]
*  Get a clue. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=826.56s)]
*  Nicotine pouches, Clue, Cool Mint. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=827.72s)]
*  So you open it up. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  I kind of like the tin, actually. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=830.1999999999999s)]
*  It's solid. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=831.9599999999999s)]
*  So it's got the. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=832.96s)]
*  So there's a controversy over these. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=836.24s)]
*  So this is a container on the top of the tin of the puck. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=838.12s)]
*  You open up and it's designed for you to put your wet chewed pouches in there. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=842.36s)]
*  And we thought about doing that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=848.0400000000001s)]
*  And then I thought, you know, that's gross. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=849.36s)]
*  I put them in my pocket. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=852.2s)]
*  They dry out. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=853.24s)]
*  I throw them away at the end of the day. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=854.24s)]
*  You don't need to hide your used nicotine pouch. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=855.24s)]
*  You definitely don't want to store them all in there. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=856.6s)]
*  There's something kind of nasty about that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=858.6s)]
*  Like imagine what grows in there. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=860.0400000000001s)]
*  I have no idea who makes Clue or what it's about. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=861.36s)]
*  I have no Clue, as we say. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=863.48s)]
*  But I'm open minded. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=866.5200000000001s)]
*  Ooh, and the pouches are a little bit softer too. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=867.5200000000001s)]
*  They're not moist, but they're not desiccated. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=869.84s)]
*  They're not tea bags and you can't feel the sand. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=872.96s)]
*  If these were toilet paper, they would be Charmin. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=881.0400000000001s)]
*  That's good. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=883.08s)]
*  The flavor's fine. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=884.08s)]
*  The presentation is actually pretty good. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=885.12s)]
*  It matters how things feel in your mouth. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=887.12s)]
*  You're putting them in your mouth. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=888.44s)]
*  Carter, who's our in-house nicotine consultant, just to be fair, like got every possible [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=891.2800000000001s)]
*  a nicotine pouch on the market and I haven't heard of all of them. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=895.8800000000001s)]
*  So I really do want to be fair. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=898.72s)]
*  This is called Pillows. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=900.0400000000001s)]
*  It says remarkably sour, sour blueberry, three milligram. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=901.0400000000001s)]
*  I've never heard of this and I've never had it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=905.6800000000001s)]
*  I have no idea who makes it. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=907.7600000000001s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=909.0400000000001s)]
*  So I'm going to assess it as honestly as I possibly can. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=910.2800000000001s)]
*  It does smell good. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=915.4000000000001s)]
*  I have to say. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=916.4000000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's dry. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=917.4000000000001s)]
*  You blow it. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=919.36s)]
*  You lose me right there. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=920.36s)]
*  I'm not into it. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=922.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm not into it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=923.28s)]
*  You want dry mouth, by the way. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=924.64s)]
*  You know meth mouth where all their teeth rot out? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=926.04s)]
*  If you've ever been at 7-Eleven late night and there's someone in there buying a Reese's [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=929.04s)]
*  product and a deck of menthol cigarettes, that's a meth head. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=932.8s)]
*  They all have rotted teeth. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=936.3s)]
*  Meth mouth. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=937.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=938.3s)]
*  Because meth makes your mouth dry. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=939.3s)]
*  So dry mouth is bad. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=940.3s)]
*  It's the sign that 13 year olds are getting high. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=942.0s)]
*  It's a sign that people are smoking meth in later life and it doesn't work in a nicotine [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=944.1999999999999s)]
*  pouch either. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=947.92s)]
*  So that's a major strike against them but I'm just going to try it anyway. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=948.92s)]
*  I like it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=951.92s)]
*  Kind of interesting. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=952.92s)]
*  It's a little bit like candy. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=953.92s)]
*  They're trying. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=956.68s)]
*  And I do think somebody has to push beyond the boundaries of conventional nicotine flavoring. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=957.68s)]
*  We are, by the way. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=964.12s)]
*  But you want to see others do it too because innovation begets innovation. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=965.8399999999999s)]
*  So if you have a company, Pillows, I think with a backward Z, that's a little gay just [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=970.04s)]
*  to be honest. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=975.76s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=976.76s)]
*  Pillows. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=977.76s)]
*  Pillows. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=978.76s)]
*  Z. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=979.76s)]
*  So now I'm making fun of them but they're pushing it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=980.76s)]
*  They're like let's just not make blueberry. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=984.64s)]
*  Let's make sour blueberry. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=985.76s)]
*  Kudos. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=987.76s)]
*  Pillows. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=988.76s)]
*  Kudos. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=989.76s)]
*  Here, try it. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=990.76s)]
*  It's actually pretty good. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=993.04s)]
*  It's not a backward Z. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=995.0s)]
*  It's not? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=997.6s)]
*  It's just how it looks. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=998.6s)]
*  I want to be fair to Pillows, all of them. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1000.6s)]
*  Your Z is actually in the right direction. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1004.12s)]
*  I'm the one who's in the wrong direction. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1005.96s)]
*  I said dyslexic. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1007.08s)]
*  We have a product. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1009.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh, I like that. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1010.2800000000001s)]
*  Seven milligram. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1011.8000000000001s)]
*  I like it when people sort of bump. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1012.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, why are you doing this anyway? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1014.8000000000001s)]
*  The nicotine is the secret sauce. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1016.6s)]
*  So people bump up the nicotine a little bit. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1019.2s)]
*  I'm totally in favor of that. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1021.84s)]
*  This is called Velo. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1022.84s)]
*  Or is it Velo? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1023.84s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1024.8400000000001s)]
*  There are 20 pouches also, which I definitely appreciate. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1026.48s)]
*  And this is Black Cherry, which is something else I like. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1029.26s)]
*  These pouches are a little white. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1031.92s)]
*  I went to the trouble of putting on the glove to keep oils from my hand off the pouch, in [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1033.8400000000001s)]
*  order to be fair. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1039.0800000000002s)]
*  And then I was pawing it with my greasy mitts. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1040.0800000000002s)]
*  So I'm going to turn it to the Michael Jackson hand right here. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1042.44s)]
*  Now the first thing you notice is these are wide and short. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1045.6000000000001s)]
*  Stumpy is the word I would use. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1049.3200000000002s)]
*  It also feels dry, but a little softer than Zin. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1051.0s)]
*  You really can't overstate how much Zin sucks. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1053.5600000000002s)]
*  Actually, I'm not being mean. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1056.76s)]
*  I'm just being honest. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1057.92s)]
*  It's actually grand. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1059.1200000000001s)]
*  You can feel it in there. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1060.1200000000001s)]
*  Anyway, this is Velo Velo in Black Cherry 7. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1061.6399999999999s)]
*  Not good. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1067.08s)]
*  Actually, that's not good at all. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1068.08s)]
*  And you saw that. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1071.04s)]
*  I don't even know how to pronounce the name of the company. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1072.04s)]
*  And I was totally complimentary and completely open-minded. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1074.28s)]
*  Even the stubby packaging, I was like, whoa, short, wide pouch. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1077.52s)]
*  I'm open-minded. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1082.36s)]
*  I don't judge. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1083.36s)]
*  All shapes and sizes. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1084.96s)]
*  That's my view. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1086.44s)]
*  So I was ready to like this pouch. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1087.44s)]
*  They don't taste these things if we're rolling them out. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1092.52s)]
*  They don't have, like nobody works at the company uses nicotine pouches. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1095.52s)]
*  Like, why don't they just pass? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1099.52s)]
*  I'll be like, okay, guys, full staff meeting, okay? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1100.52s)]
*  We're planning on rolling out a brand new flavor called Black Cherry. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1104.52s)]
*  Why don't we pass it out to the guys who work here, like the guys on the loading dock and [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1107.52s)]
*  running the lines, making it. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1112.32s)]
*  Have people who use nicotine pouches try the flavor before you introduce it to say 350 [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1114.28s)]
*  million Americans? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1120.2s)]
*  Just a pro tip for you. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1121.2s)]
*  We've got a bunch of prototypes of flavors. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1122.3600000000001s)]
*  The first thing I did, they sent me a case of them and labeled them all. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1123.76s)]
*  And I gave them out to people I know who are very serious, you know, who use nicotine pouches [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1127.0800000000002s)]
*  all day long. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1131.24s)]
*  And I'm like, what do you think? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1132.24s)]
*  And use the whole tin and get back to me. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1133.24s)]
*  Don't give me just like your first impression or something. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1134.94s)]
*  Anyway, they clearly didn't do that with Black Cherry Velo because it's got a weird, like [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1137.48s)]
*  not even aftertaste, but like side taste, like lurking in the shadows. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1144.96s)]
*  Or something ugly. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1149.04s)]
*  Thumbs down. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1150.04s)]
*  You have the V is backwards. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1151.04s)]
*  Next up is Velo Wintergreen. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1155.76s)]
*  By the way, there's room for more than one nicotine pouch. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1159.56s)]
*  There's only room for one truly great nicotine pouch, but whatever. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1162.32s)]
*  I mean, Coke always had Pepsi. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1164.84s)]
*  Levi's always had Lee. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1166.52s)]
*  Marlboro always had Winston. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1168.0s)]
*  Like it's okay to have a kind of beta position, someone in the bitch seat behind you. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1169.32s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1172.76s)]
*  It's a better first impression than the Black Cherry. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1176.56s)]
*  I can't overstate my disappointment on the Black Cherry. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1178.36s)]
*  I like the fruit flavors. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1180.52s)]
*  I'll just be totally blunt. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1181.52s)]
*  I'll just admit it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1182.52s)]
*  We're going to do like a boysenberry at some point just to please me. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1183.52s)]
*  But everyone has to make it wintergreen. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1185.9599999999998s)]
*  It's the law. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1187.12s)]
*  We're close to the law. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1188.12s)]
*  It's not bad. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1190.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's fine. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1192.12s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1193.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, it's like fine. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1194.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's, this is the good enough flavor. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1195.9199999999998s)]
*  This is like someone you were dating, your friend would be like, well, she's got a lot [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1197.8799999999999s)]
*  extra curriculars. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1199.9599999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1200.9599999999998s)]
*  If I was like, if I was walking down the sidewalk and Velo nine milligram Wintergreen walked [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1201.9599999999998s)]
*  past me, I don't mean to mean, but I wouldn't even notice her. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1207.12s)]
*  All right. This is a product called Rogue. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1210.28s)]
*  It's kind of torquey. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1213.8799999999999s)]
*  Rogue, go Rogue. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1215.36s)]
*  Plow your own path. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1217.52s)]
*  Are you a Pathfinder? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1219.24s)]
*  You the Kit Carson of nicotine pouch users. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1220.3999999999999s)]
*  Go Rogue. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1223.1599999999999s)]
*  Uncontainable, uncontrollable, made by some giant publicly traded company. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1224.1599999999999s)]
*  But it's Rogue. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1228.2s)]
*  I don't know who makes Rogue. I'm just being a dick. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1229.96s)]
*  Anyway, I'm open minded. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1231.52s)]
*  So this is a six milligram mango. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1232.52s)]
*  I won't rest until there's like a passion fruit Alp. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1234.52s)]
*  Probably I'm the only person who will use it, but I will. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1237.56s)]
*  Again, we're looking at a slightly wider path. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1239.32s)]
*  Oh, it's granular, though. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1241.2s)]
*  Come on, Rogue. You're not really going Rogue, are you? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1243.72s)]
*  It's kind of the opposite of Rogue, isn't it? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1246.48s)]
*  You're basically aping Zen. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1248.44s)]
*  You're like, we're so Rogue, we're going to do a Zen, but call it mango. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1250.92s)]
*  Oh, it smells good. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1256.2s)]
*  I will. I will say that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1257.04s)]
*  Look, I'm fair. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1258.08s)]
*  Now, obviously, I want to outsell all these companies. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1259.08s)]
*  Our product is better, just like as factually. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1261.2s)]
*  But you know, you want to encourage excellence no matter what. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1263.72s)]
*  But it's not good. It's not good at all. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1267.88s)]
*  Obviously, the flavor of a pouch evolves over time. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1269.48s)]
*  When you first put it in, you get one sensation. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1272.4s)]
*  This is true of all products. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1274.24s)]
*  It's true of chewing tobacco. It's true of cigarettes. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1275.44s)]
*  It's certainly true of cigars. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1277.52s)]
*  So it is fair to say that a pouch, you can't judge a pouch by its first sensations. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1278.8s)]
*  But that doesn't mean first sensations don't matter. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1283.08s)]
*  They really do matter. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1284.72s)]
*  And the first sensation here has a kind of this was made in a chemical plant [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1285.68s)]
*  in New Jersey kind of feeling like I don't know the process. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1290.0s)]
*  Behind Rogue or maybe it's Ragui. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1293.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm not honestly I don't know how it's pronounced, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1296.3200000000002s)]
*  but I can just imagine out behind the loading dock, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1298.1200000000001s)]
*  some Dominican guy with lots of tattoos, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1301.16s)]
*  just like got a hand truck with this giant 50 gallon drum that says mango [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1302.92s)]
*  right across the back. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1307.3200000000002s)]
*  It's been made at a chemical plant on 95 in New Jersey. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1308.72s)]
*  I'm just guessing. I'm just guessing. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1311.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm saying what it tastes like. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1312.88s)]
*  But I'm getting the sense that they don't have like a mango tree [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1313.88s)]
*  in the yard at Ragui or Rogue. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1317.16s)]
*  Nicotine on demand. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1320.68s)]
*  It's kind of a ludicrous like, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1323.36s)]
*  what else would you get nicotine by accident? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1325.1599999999999s)]
*  Like what? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1327.48s)]
*  All nicotine is by demand. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1328.8799999999999s)]
*  The people demand nicotine. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1330.56s)]
*  That's why we have it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1332.52s)]
*  We don't have it because the authorities want us to have it. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1333.6399999999999s)]
*  They definitely don't. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1335.48s)]
*  Anyway, this is I thought it was lime. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1336.48s)]
*  I was actually pretty excited. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1338.04s)]
*  Someone needs to make a lime nicotine pouch. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1338.84s)]
*  I think that would be super cool. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1340.84s)]
*  But it's not lime. It's apple. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1341.96s)]
*  But, you know, I support that, too. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1343.12s)]
*  And there are a lot of varieties of apple, sour apple. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1344.1599999999999s)]
*  I just reviewed a chilled apple in our prototype. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1346.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know how I felt about it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1348.52s)]
*  Still thinking. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1349.76s)]
*  But this is just flat out apple. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1350.3600000000001s)]
*  Smells good. It's not. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1354.92s)]
*  It's a little muted, actually, if I'm being totally honest. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1356.72s)]
*  The smell. Why does the smell matter? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1359.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, why do aesthetics matter? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1361.76s)]
*  What is beauty matter? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1364.1200000000001s)]
*  Does it add to your bottom line? No. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1365.68s)]
*  But it adds to your life. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1367.8s)]
*  So smell does matter. I smell everything. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1370.3600000000001s)]
*  I never put a single thing in my mouth before smelling it ever. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1371.88s)]
*  Not my whole life. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1374.4s)]
*  And I don't care if it's embarrassing or not. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1375.0s)]
*  And this smells fine, but not. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1376.96s)]
*  It doesn't quite have the punch that it should have. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1378.04s)]
*  Like a true apple, like a green apple on a cold day. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1380.6s)]
*  Crunch red apple, even a red apple, which tend to be a little pulpier. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1383.76s)]
*  Crunch apple. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1387.52s)]
*  This is more like this more like a pulpy apple, maybe with a worm in it. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1388.76s)]
*  But I can't say because I haven't tasted it yet. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1391.72s)]
*  This is inoffensive. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1404.2s)]
*  This is like, again, this is like just enough to be fine. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1405.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1408.8799999999999s)]
*  Now we're moving on to something called zone or Zane. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1410.52s)]
*  Zane or zone has two, three factors in its favors. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1415.28s)]
*  Right off the bat, I'm just looking, by the way, you say, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1420.56s)]
*  oh, you can't judge a nicotine pouch by its cover. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1422.32s)]
*  You kind of can actually. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1424.48s)]
*  You can learn a lot. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1425.52s)]
*  First of all, it's 20 pouches just like Alp. Bless you. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1426.36s)]
*  It's almost starting to feel like Zin is the industry lagger, not leader. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1429.24s)]
*  Like they're the greediest people in the nicotine business. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1434.76s)]
*  We only give you 15 pouches up your Zane, actually. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1437.2s)]
*  Second is nine milligram, which we like to see. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1440.8400000000001s)]
*  The worst they can say is it's an addictive product. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1442.88s)]
*  Nicotine is an addictive product. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1445.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I had no idea. Oh, really? Is it really? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1446.68s)]
*  Thanks, Mom. I had no idea it was addictive. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1448.44s)]
*  Anyway, and it's something called dragon fruit. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1449.96s)]
*  Now I have no idea what dragon fruit is. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1452.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it appears in nature, but it sounds kind of exotic. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1454.24s)]
*  So I'm going to try it right now. I open it up first. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1457.48s)]
*  Wow. Wow. It's pink. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1459.1200000000001s)]
*  Actually, it's more precisely salmon kind of salmon color. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1462.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's farm raised salmon or wild salmon. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1466.12s)]
*  It doesn't matter, but it's got that kind of off pink color. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1469.04s)]
*  It's sort of iridescent. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1471.8799999999999s)]
*  Now it sounds like I'm attacking it. I'm not. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1473.32s)]
*  I'm just I'm actually kind of mesmerized by burning my retinas. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1474.9199999999998s)]
*  Kind of cool. Next to smell. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1478.0s)]
*  That smells like shit, actually. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1481.1999999999998s)]
*  Oh, my God. Well, here it was supposed [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1483.28s)]
*  and not shit like your cat did something in there, not like that. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1487.9599999999998s)]
*  Just like, oh, man, that doesn't smell good at all. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  Let me try it again. Now I've aired it out like wine. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1495.96s)]
*  Sometimes you need to get a little oxygen in there. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1498.72s)]
*  You have to let it decant. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1501.04s)]
*  OK, so I've decanted the nicotine pouches. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1502.8400000000001s)]
*  It's absolutely awful. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1506.92s)]
*  Like that's like the worst smell I've ever smelled. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1508.04s)]
*  That's in fact. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1510.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, I don't want to be really good to smell it. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1512.04s)]
*  It's really bad. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1517.0s)]
*  It's really bad. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1519.16s)]
*  Now, just so you know, just be careful of it. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1520.56s)]
*  It's called Zane. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1522.32s)]
*  It's dragon fruit, and it actually smells like the ass end of a dragon. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1523.32s)]
*  It's been digesting all kinds of nights. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1527.96s)]
*  I'm going to put that in my mouth. I don't care. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1534.08s)]
*  I know this is tasting. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1535.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm not putting Zane dragon fruit in my mouth. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1536.8s)]
*  No. Tell me if I'm being unfair. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1539.4399999999998s)]
*  Your smell is like an early warning system. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1544.96s)]
*  It's the NORAD of your body. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1547.1599999999999s)]
*  So your your smell, your nose, your olfactory senses [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1549.04s)]
*  that you know that it's coming, it's coming, it's coming. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1552.0s)]
*  Should I let it in? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1553.8400000000001s)]
*  And in the case of Zane number nine dragon fruit, do not let that in. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1554.5600000000002s)]
*  All right. Next one up. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1558.76s)]
*  I don't even know what that says. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1560.6000000000001s)]
*  K-dobar? K-dobar? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1561.96s)]
*  I don't even know. K-A-D-O-B-A-R. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1566.28s)]
*  OK, well, that's bizarre. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  Blueberry candy. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1570.64s)]
*  A lot of people are going to be like, that's way too fruity for me. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1571.76s)]
*  Question your sexuality. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1574.2s)]
*  Feel like blueberry candy? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1575.3600000000001s)]
*  I've got four kids. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1576.96s)]
*  I'm totally comfortable with blueberry candy. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1578.3600000000001s)]
*  If this is good, I'll say so. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1581.24s)]
*  OK, these are long and slender. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1582.52s)]
*  Dry. Yep. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1585.44s)]
*  Granular. When will they learn? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1586.52s)]
*  Visual taste is not good. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1592.36s)]
*  You got to test these things before putting them in packages and selling them. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1593.84s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? This is not good. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1597.08s)]
*  Here we go. We've got something called Wynn. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1600.52s)]
*  Nicotine on the go. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1603.0s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1605.1200000000001s)]
*  What nicotine isn't on the go? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1606.96s)]
*  If you're only using nicotine when you're resting, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1608.68s)]
*  you're kind of missing the point. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1611.28s)]
*  Nicotine is for all times. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1612.36s)]
*  Have I slept with a nicotine pouch in? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1613.76s)]
*  I'm not going to answer that question on the grounds. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1615.32s)]
*  It made me look pretty darn cool. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1616.72s)]
*  But yeah, I have. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1618.88s)]
*  But here's the thing I like about this. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1619.72s)]
*  It's banana chill. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1621.0s)]
*  Now, I'm a little skeptical of the chill. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1622.68s)]
*  Why would you chill a banana? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1624.32s)]
*  I am looking for a banana nicotine pouch. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1625.92s)]
*  Probably nobody else is. I am. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1629.6s)]
*  In fact, we're testing one right now. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1631.4s)]
*  Yeah. Why do they put the chill in bananas? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1635.04s)]
*  Like, have some confidence in the flavor. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1637.28s)]
*  If it's good enough for the chimps, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1639.04s)]
*  it's good enough for me. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1640.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's crap. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1644.36s)]
*  Doesn't taste at all like banana. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1646.6399999999999s)]
*  If I could give some unsolicited advice to the Wynn Corporation, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1650.12s)]
*  have confidence in your banana. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1653.48s)]
*  Be proud of your banana. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1655.96s)]
*  Feel no banana shame. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1657.6399999999999s)]
*  It's banana. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1659.44s)]
*  It's in everybody's flavor. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1660.52s)]
*  Everybody loves bananas. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1661.96s)]
*  And that is not good at all. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1663.24s)]
*  That's awful. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1664.3999999999999s)]
*  I really think the race is on. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1665.2s)]
*  This is like getting to the South Pole, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1666.52s)]
*  like the 21st century version. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1668.44s)]
*  Who can make the first truly good banana nicotine pouch? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1670.6s)]
*  And may the best pouch win. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1673.9199999999998s)]
*  So if there's one piece of advice I could give to nicotine pouch users coming up, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1677.36s)]
*  and I would give the same advice to a young woman dating, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1681.6399999999999s)]
*  don't settle. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1685.28s)]
*  Don't fall for the first nicotine pouch you run into at 7-Eleven. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1686.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1690.48s)]
*  Like, save yourself. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1691.28s)]
*  Pull back a little bit. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1693.2s)]
*  Like, is this the pouch for you? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1694.44s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1695.56s)]
*  High standards. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1696.6s)]
*  Set your standards. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1697.8s)]
*  Maintain them. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1698.84s)]
*  You're worth it. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1700.12s)]
*  Don't put some dry, granular, degrading piece of garbage in your mouth. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1701.36s)]
*  And whatever you do, don't put that dragon fruit crap that smelled like roadkill [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1705.36s)]
*  made by...what was that company? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1710.8799999999999s)]
*  Zane. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1712.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, Zane. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKVdD9fT5A&t=1712.9199999999998s)]
