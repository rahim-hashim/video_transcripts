# America Is Following in China’s Footsteps. Here’s How We Stop It.
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg)
*  Shortly after George Floyd died Memorial Day weekend 2020, people began to say that what was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=0.0s)]
*  happening in the United States bore some resemblance to what happened in China 50 years [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=5.2s)]
*  ago, the Cultural Revolution, with Red Guards and struggle sessions, public humiliations, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=10.64s)]
*  public atonements, a kind of secular frenzy that looked very much like a hate-centered religious [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=16.8s)]
*  rite, the Cultural Revolution. But was that overstatement? Well, Xi Van Fleet has seen both. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=23.76s)]
*  She's Chinese. She was seven years old in 1966 when the Cultural Revolution started [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=32.32s)]
*  and 17 when it ended with Mao's death in 1976. And along the way she became one of its victims. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=37.44s)]
*  She moved to this country, to Kentucky, in 1986 and she's been here ever since. So she has seen [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  both revolutions firsthand and she's written a new book comparing them with a warning. It's called [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=50.96s)]
*  Mao's America and we're grateful to have her, Xi Van Fleet, in the studio with us now. Xi, thanks so [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=56.24s)]
*  much for coming on. Thank you. This is unbelievable that I'm here with you. Oh, I'm so grateful you [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=61.2s)]
*  are. So you were seven years old when the Cultural Revolution started, the equivalent of first grade. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=66.88s)]
*  When, what was the moment that you realized something strange and important was happening [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=73.2s)]
*  in China? Yes, to me, my memory is it happened overnight and overnight I just noticed there's a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=76.88s)]
*  lot of what's called big character posters everywhere. It's just big pieces of paper [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=84.8s)]
*  and with words written in very large letters so everyone can read it from distance, kind of like [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  today's social media. Crude propaganda. Yes, it's really the posters is really of people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=99.52s)]
*  denouncing others. In my school, I remember it's the papers were denouncing administrators [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  or teachers and it's overnight and it's just everywhere and in the cafeteria because that's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=115.84s)]
*  the only place that a high wall that's indoor and it just from a ceiling from the floor to the ceiling [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=122.08s)]
*  and it's a class stopped and so one day I went to the classroom and I saw a note on the blackboard, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  no class for three days and that three days lasted for two years. Two years? Two years, no school [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  because this school was like all the other institutions was shut down by the Red Guards [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=148.8s)]
*  and the Red Guards and I think nowadays more and more Americans are familiar with that and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=156.96s)]
*  Red Guards were the kids from elementary school to universities so they took over the country [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=162.8s)]
*  so there's no school for two years so what did we do as a kid? We went to the street so every day [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=171.44s)]
*  we went to the street we watched the Cultural Revolution unfolding and that is struggle [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=179.52s)]
*  for the people who were denounced and eventually become violent. So it was young people [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=185.6s)]
*  aiming their rage at the behest in the direction of the central government of Mao [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=195.2s)]
*  against not foreigners who threatened China but it begins against Chinese against your own people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=200.32s)]
*  Yes and it is difficult even for me to understand and it took me a long time to understand what [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=205.28s)]
*  the Cultural Revolution was about. It is a revolution that Mao launched against CCP, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=211.92s)]
*  against his own party, against his own government. Why? Because he thought he was losing influence. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  He thought he was no longer had absolute power so it's really a power struggle and this time [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=229.04s)]
*  he did not use the armies. He did not have to. He had tens of millions of young people that he [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=238.08s)]
*  had indoctrinated in the government school for the past 17 years. They're ready to go, just give them [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=244.56s)]
*  a call say you are now mobilized to defend Mao and to defend communism and that's what [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  the how they got the kids all involved and very familiar to Americans now. They dismantled the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=262.8s)]
*  criminal justice system. No police, really just like a defund police. So the Red Guards could do [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=273.44s)]
*  anything through consequences and eventually they start to kill. Kill their teachers, kill their [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=282.64s)]
*  principals and they kill millions of people. Did I mean the normal people who are watching this, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  your family I assume, did anybody say anything about it? Nobody can say anything just like here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=297.12s)]
*  Why? Because Mao openly supported them and Mao had eight rallies to meet the Red Guards in Tiananmen [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=303.12s)]
*  Square eight times to declare that he was their Red Commander in Chief and those are his little [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=314.56s)]
*  Red Guards. So there's no dissent at all and things just get progressively crazier and crazier [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=324.16s)]
*  and crazier. Do people think that this was going to stop? No one knows and I remember that in the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=332.96s)]
*  first and started it was somewhat peaceful because all they did was destroy the past. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=339.84s)]
*  In Mao's words it's the four old ideas, old culture, old custom and old habits. Get rid of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  them all. That includes destroy all the statues. The statues mostly Buddhist statues, Christian [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=358.64s)]
*  statues, everything has to come down and everything that is old has to be destroyed. So when they [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=365.76s)]
*  finish with the public spaces they went to people's homes and I witnessed the Red Guards went to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=372.32s)]
*  people's homes, took everything they thought was old. Old is bad. Old is something that needs to be [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=379.52s)]
*  get rid of including furniture, people's old photos and everything because the goal is to get [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=386.24s)]
*  rid of the past so we can replace it with the pure Maoism. I remember reading about the Cultural [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=395.52s)]
*  Revolution years ago reading a biography of Mao and was so struck by how much Mao hated the Chinese, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=403.52s)]
*  hated the country, hated the history, hated the culture and yet he was in charge of the country. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=410.32s)]
*  I thought that's very strange. So we were taught that Mao was our savior and we have some saying [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=414.64s)]
*  that he was our savior. He made it possible for us to have a better life. Why? Because he removed [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=422.0s)]
*  these three big mountains that had been suppressing Chinese people. They are the foreign imperialism, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=430.0s)]
*  the old feudalism and the bourgeois or capitalism. He removed them all. That's why we could have such [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=438.64s)]
*  happy life. So no, no, no. We never taught that he hate us. No, he did but we were taught we should [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=447.12s)]
*  be so grateful and he was our not only savior during the Cultural Revolution. He really became our God. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=454.88s)]
*  Do you remember the moment that the Red Guard went from carrying slogans and yelling at people, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=462.32s)]
*  humiliating them to the point where they went to killing people? Were you shocked by that? Were [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=468.79999999999995s)]
*  people shocked by that? Actually it started about the same time because in the very beginning [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=474.79999999999995s)]
*  beginning it only started on campuses and and killing started as early as August of 1966, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=481.36s)]
*  few months after the Cultural Revolution. The first killing took place in a very prestigious [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=491.12s)]
*  middle school for girls. They, a bunch of girls, young girls as young as 12 as old as 16, they [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=498.8s)]
*  beat, tortured and killed their principal. That was in August 1966 and I was an elementary school [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=507.92s)]
*  student. So in my school I did not see killing but I did see attacks by the kids and one of the things [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=518.96s)]
*  I remember so vividly is a teacher. She is a pretty teacher and she usually will dress kind of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=526.48s)]
*  nicely and that's considered bourgeois. So the kids followed her, called her names, eventually [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=535.6s)]
*  they surrounded her and spit on her. So after a while she was covered with spit from head to toe [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=543.76s)]
*  and that was considered mild because she was not hurt physically. The same time we heard [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=552.4s)]
*  killing happened in middle school especially in universities but the police were told to stay away [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=561.04s)]
*  from campuses and if the Red Guards hit them they are not allowed to hit back just like here. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=568.72s)]
*  So what happened to you as you got older during this period? So the violence of the Red Guard [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=576.8s)]
*  movement lasted until 1969. By then all the power was taken down by the Red Guards [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=583.84s)]
*  for miles. So basically all the institutions were paralyzed. There's no one in charge. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=594.48s)]
*  So they thought okay now it's time for us to get some power and then they start to fight each other [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=602.8000000000001s)]
*  for power and that's when it's getting really really violent. It becomes almost like a civil war. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=610.9599999999999s)]
*  They raided the military places and got real weapons. Before it was just sticks and stones [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=618.24s)]
*  and rocks and now it's a real weapon and they started to kill each other. The different Red [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=627.76s)]
*  Guard factions? Factions because they thought now it's time for us to get power and then exactly [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=633.6s)]
*  the faction. It got so bad that tanks were deployed in cities where there's a lot of defense [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=640.16s)]
*  factories and that's not that far from where I live and it was not safe by then for us to go [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=648.0s)]
*  to the street. One day a three bullet landed under our window when we have dinner. So it was [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  and it was so bad that one day I described in my book that we were outside and we heard this [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=662.9599999999999s)]
*  really awful Chinese funeral music and then words came back that they have a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=670.72s)]
*  corp parade. So it's one faction of the Red Guards try to gain public sympathy. So they had the people [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=677.68s)]
*  that were killed by the other faction on the parade. That is the time that Mao got rid of them. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=687.52s)]
*  So they basically they were his creation. He gave them all this power to consolidate his own [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=695.12s)]
*  but once they became a threat to him he did what? He suppressed them. Yeah. Send military to suppress [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=702.0s)]
*  them. So they we don't know the number the real number but he killed tens of thousands of Red [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=709.36s)]
*  Guards and then eventually he got them together the leaders and said you disappointed me and then [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=717.76s)]
*  just like that the whole movement was dismantled and they all sent to the countryside. Many of them [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=726.48s)]
*  sent to the virgin land like a gulag to be re-educated through physical labor and that's [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=734.56s)]
*  how you become real communists. You can't just do the what you did in the city. You have to be [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=743.4399999999999s)]
*  really go through hard labor to become real communists and off they go and for from 19 [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=749.5999999999999s)]
*  from 1969 from that time on all city kids from high school were sent to the countryside [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=758.32s)]
*  and when I graduated from high school in 1975 I was too sent to the countryside doing the physical [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=767.76s)]
*  labor that was very primitive and I stayed there for three years after Mao died and after Deng [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=777.12s)]
*  Xiaoping reopened universities that's how I could go to college to study. What did you do in the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=784.32s)]
*  countryside? Yeah that is not a farm so a lot of people think about the countryside to think about [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  farm no. Yeah countryside here is a good thing. Yeah no no no it's a a commune every rural area [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=797.9200000000001s)]
*  was arranged or organized as commune commune's collective farming so in the commune there are a [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=806.32s)]
*  lot of production teams and so it's all run by the CCP so what I did is every day we would gather [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=813.52s)]
*  in the meeting place of the production team and the leader would tell us what to do so we do [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=822.4s)]
*  their work and we get a point and then in the harvest time you use the point to get some [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=828.0s)]
*  produce, green or potato or whatever. To get food? To get food yeah so I not only experienced and [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=835.8399999999999s)]
*  witnessed the whole cultural revolution I also got three years working in the field and get to know [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=844.88s)]
*  how peasants did. Those peasants put Mao in power. He mobilized the whole peasantry and promised them [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=852.8s)]

*  and I remember in a class that I took and it's about special education when the the act of [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1048.3200000000002s)]

*  just took the class but there are others that were special ed teachers that we should be very [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1072.08s)]
*  very respectful and we should never say blind we should say people with vision [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1077.6799999999998s)]
*  impaired vision something like that I don't even remember and I was so impressed as it's Americans [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1084.96s)]

*  and now we know right during the process and we were taught you can't say vision [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1097.04s)]
*  impaired now it's something something something different and now you know what what's the correct [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1103.76s)]
*  way to call those people blind yeah according to Stanford now that is the correct way so that just [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1108.56s)]
*  remind me of the cultural revolution that there was only one correct way of thinking of talking [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1116.0s)]
*  and if you don't do it you're getting into trouble so I just noticed so when the language [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1124.08s)]
*  started changing and people announced that you know from here on out we're calling x y we're [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1130.32s)]
*  calling I don't know Peking Beijing or the orient Asia or whatever the blind visually impaired that [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1136.6399999999999s)]
*  reminded you of the cultural revolution a little bit I'm just saying if you ask me what I noticed [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1145.12s)]
*  that was something I noticed because I noticed later you can't say that you can't there are so [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1152.08s)]
*  many things you can't say or you have to say it differently and who tell you the authority tell you [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1157.44s)]
*  that's the correct way of saying saying things and that's correct way of basically thinking [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1162.88s)]
*  okay but still I did not lose my sleep over those things and until later and in my book I did say [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1167.68s)]
*  Trent Law probably is the thing the person that came to my mind that can really pin down [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1176.8s)]
*  the moment I really say this kind of really like cultural revolution I don't even know the story [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1182.0s)]
*  whatever he was called a racist because he said something I said that really sounds like cultural [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1189.6s)]
*  revolution you say something and your life is over. Trent Law was a Republican senator from [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1195.6s)]
*  Mississippi who went to the funeral of the longest-serving Republican senator from South [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1200.08s)]
*  Carolina Strom Thurmond and praised him at his funeral and for that he was forced to resign right [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1204.56s)]
*  yeah and that is that really made an impression on me I think that's just like cultural revolution [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1211.76s)]
*  and but things get from bad to worse and it was way before 2020 that I know that things is really [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1218.3999999999999s)]
*  really going wrong because in the workplace I was invited to be a member of DNI diversity and [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1226.56s)]
*  inclusion council and I noticed every member is has identity there and I just realized [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1238.72s)]
*  this is not really about making people work together help people work together it's more like [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1246.88s)]
*  a political identity yes and but things you know got so much bad in the 2020 when I saw the Antifa [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1253.52s)]
*  and the BMN burning our cities I said this is no longer some kind of troubling sign here there this [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1264.48s)]
*  is a full-blown Marxist revolution this is exactly what I noticed or what I witnessed during cultural [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1270.24s)]
*  revolution so I said I got to do something I have to get involved the one way or the other [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1277.92s)]
*  and that's the end of 2020 I got involved with the Laudan Republican Laudan County Republican [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1284.0s)]
*  Committee and after that and now we get emails you know ask us to go to school board and I was [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1291.6000000000001s)]
*  never never involved politically to go and give a public speech it was just intimidating to me [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1299.6000000000001s)]
*  and but I got so much support from the members say I said I don't even have children in school [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1307.12s)]
*  at that time this it doesn't matter we all are taxpayer payers and then you should have [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1312.56s)]
*  go there and then voice your your opinion so I said okay okay I've been very alarmed about [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1319.1999999999998s)]
*  what's going on in our school you are now teaching training our children to be social justice warriors [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1326.0s)]
*  to lose our country and our history going up in mouse china all this thing very familiar [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  the communist regime use the same critical theory to divide people the only difference [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1337.8400000000001s)]
*  is they use class instead of race and back then you know you have the wear a mask I said thank [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1343.04s)]

*  just as a foreigner reading about it of the cultural revolution that's always struck me [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1360.64s)]
*  is the mass hysteria rational people becoming irrational people going crazy getting caught [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1364.64s)]
*  up in this frenzy and really believing things that are that are absurd I want to show you a [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1371.0400000000002s)]

*  this is a table of affluent white ladies who have paid money to be told they're racist [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1384.72s)]
*  and I just want to get your view of this watch this actually Margaret you didn't say yours what [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1391.36s)]

*  I also work in environmental engineering I have absolutely no people of color or minimal people [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1410.56s)]
*  of color possibly the exclusion being slightly Hispanic Saeira doesn't like her attitudes [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1416.72s)]
*  I can say a racist thing you've done because it just happened when you just talked to me the [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1424.08s)]
*  way you just did this is how white women talk to us all the time these are microaggressions [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1429.04s)]
*  when I say the exact same thing to my girlfriend who says the same exact thing I don't care if [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1434.72s)]
*  you talk to everybody like that the way you just spoke to me was straight up white supremacy you [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1440.48s)]
*  actually just answered with racism white supremacy is said to be hidden in innocuous phrases and [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1446.88s)]
*  banal behavior the smallest things could be considered racist it's enough that a person [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1452.08s)]
*  from a minority group feels insulted absolutely sounding terribly white I don't know that I was [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1457.44s)]
*  all that racist to start with but I also would be more aware or hyper aware of my [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1464.4s)]
*  thoughts or reactions to circumstances that would be racist so here we have privileged white ladies [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1475.44s)]
*  being barked at by even more privileged non-white ladies about their sins and the white ladies are [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1482.0800000000002s)]
*  loving it but what is that that's a struggle session and that's something that everyone have [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1488.32s)]
*  to go through in the during the cultural revolution in the very beginning that was those in power that [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1495.28s)]
*  was taken down by the red guards they were struggled against in the so-called struggle session [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1500.96s)]
*  that was brutal some of them were killed right there in a public trial but everyone have to go [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1507.28s)]
*  through the gentler form of struggle session and that's called criticism and self-criticism [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1513.84s)]
*  so as kids we will have that kind of a struggle session every week and we will sit together [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1521.28s)]
*  and after you know referring some of the mouse quotes and we will criticize self you really [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1528.48s)]
*  start with yourself and you would say and I did this and that not quite up to the requirement [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1535.9199999999998s)]
*  by mouse instruction and and I still have this bourgeois influence in me and and then everyone [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1542.8s)]
*  will join and say yes you're right you did this and this that day you said this is this that day [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1550.72s)]
*  and then we go around so we struggle against others and we against ourselves so to get rid of [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1556.1599999999999s)]
*  every little incorrect thoughts from our mind that's what it is so China is I mean overwhelmingly [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1563.44s)]
*  hand Chinese so you're not going to have racial lines in a country that's got one race [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1572.32s)]
*  but if you take the race stuff out white supremacists it's identical right identity politics [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1580.56s)]
*  that's exactly what it is in China it started with class yes and they divide the whole population [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1587.9199999999998s)]
*  into two classes red class and the black class and you can figure out pretty much what it means [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1596.16s)]
*  red are the correct class and black is the incorrect plus those are the property owners [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1602.96s)]
*  landlords or people with bourgeois worldview they're all black class so they are the enemy [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1611.2s)]
*  of the state we all look alike right but that's how China was divided [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1619.52s)]
*  by Mao and I'm talking about identity it's not something you know you say okay I'm black class [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1626.96s)]
*  no you are black class and that is your identity and that is required in every government document [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1633.2s)]
*  just like here race you have to figure out you have to fill out what you raise what your race is [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1640.08s)]
*  there you have to fill out what your class is and then you pass it down to your children [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1646.4s)]
*  and your children's children and you will forever be the enemy of the state and here [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1653.2s)]
*  we have we still have class you know Bernie Sanders still talk about one percent versus 99 [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1660.0800000000002s)]
*  yes but race is the most potent way to divide America and that's just exactly the same thing [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1667.0400000000002s)]
*  that happened in China what maybe there's similarities that the people who are screaming [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1675.52s)]
*  about privilege themselves have the most privilege right I mean so the people leading the struggle [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1681.2s)]
*  sections were obviously more privileged than the people being interrogated correct it's in the [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1688.48s)]
*  revolution most of the revolution you can see who started it's usually the elite yes Mao was from [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1692.8s)]
*  a rich family yes yeah all his comrades are from rich family only people from rich family had the [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1701.12s)]

*  the Chinese cultural revolution the critical race theory has its roots in cultural Marxism [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1880.96s)]

*  and they do not teach the horror or the history of communism because those that in control they [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1934.64s)]
*  are marxists they want to use the same tactics to gain power that's why it's not taught it's [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=1941.84s)]

*  I have no access to other information I could not think thinking I think it [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2073.12s)]
*  requires you know something you have information you have different sources of information [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2080.72s)]
*  and hopefully you can you know go through them and come up with your own conclusion that's critical [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2085.44s)]
*  thinking right when you have only one information you can't think I can only think one way that's [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2092.8s)]
*  Mao's way that's the correct way and I have been like that for a long time some people will say [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2098.88s)]
*  that they see through things within the culture not me I'm totally into it I'm totally accept [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2104.5600000000004s)]

*  be wrong you've seen the the whole cycle I mean you're born 10 years after the communist revolution [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2117.76s)]
*  and you you know you you watch the whole cycle of it um so given that where do you think things [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2124.48s)]
*  are going in this country right now where are we in that progression people ask me that a lot [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2131.44s)]
*  you know it is really really decades in the making in America after the um the 60s [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2138.0800000000004s)]
*  when the marxists took over all universities they have been creating generations not just [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2146.56s)]
*  one generation generations of marxists all people who absolutely um follow that those ideologies [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2152.48s)]
*  now they are in our institutions in every institutions including educational system [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2161.36s)]
*  corporations government and even our military it is everywhere so I always say that the infiltration [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2168.56s)]
*  of communism is complete in this country and so it is it is really really we're in dire situation [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2178.48s)]
*  so what do we do well we have to start from educating people and to wake people up [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2189.12s)]
*  by telling them history by telling them that what's going on here is nothing new it happened [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2195.76s)]
*  before not that long ago it happened to me 50 years ago the witness the survivors are still here [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2201.76s)]
*  trying to tell American people this is communist revolution and the goal is to destroy this country [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2208.7200000000003s)]
*  and the goal is for the globalist I always say globalist to take power can it be stopped [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2217.44s)]
*  it has to be stopped so we have to wake people up get involved and sometimes I feel so um just [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2224.56s)]
*  feel like there's no hope but many times I do feel like there's a great hope I have been invited to [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2234.56s)]
*  talk to so many people around the country and I met people who are parents who never involved [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2241.68s)]
*  politically just like me but they are involved now they're fighting they're fighting in the trenches [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2247.52s)]
*  and so I say there's a hope there's a great hope and we can't just fight because we kind of figure [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2254.0s)]
*  we might win to me we have to fight because we believe in it and what I believe in is America [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2262.2400000000002s)]
*  and so there's no choice but to fight people who grew up in this country most I know assume [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2271.36s)]
*  um that it can never get too out of control here yes there's a revolution going on we're living [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2280.0s)]
*  through it right now but because it's America that revolution will never entail the killing of a lot [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2285.44s)]
*  of people all revolutions end up killing a lot of people but ours won't somehow what do you think [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2291.2799999999997s)]
*  just looking out on the streets and the campus today look those people who have no empathy [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2296.48s)]
*  because their empathy is guided by the ideology that ideology is Marxist ideology [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2304.4s)]
*  about oppressors and oppressed the worldview is looking everything in terms of who is the [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2313.28s)]
*  oppressor and who is the oppressed and that is absolutely communist worldview and for those who [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2320.0s)]
*  are oppressed anything they do to the oppressor is justified that include murder [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2327.36s)]
*  kidnap and raping this all justified just like the cultural revolution [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2337.2000000000003s)]
*  and that's what's happening in today's America those are the absolute result of decades of [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2342.0s)]
*  indoctrination so people with no empathy will kill will kill and today they're just out there [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIay3uL17Jg&t=2350.16s)]
