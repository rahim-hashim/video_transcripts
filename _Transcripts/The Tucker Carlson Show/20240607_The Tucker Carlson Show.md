# Rep. Thomas Massie Reveals Deep State Secrets and Teaches You How to Live Off-Grid
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo)
*  Do you know James Carville? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1.28s)]
*  So he got stuck at a roast one time when we worked together in New Orleans [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2.16s)]
*  and had to take a leak and it was on C-SPAN. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6.24s)]
*  And on the tape, which I have seen, he's sitting there and he's kind of shuffling in a seat. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=9.92s)]
*  All of a sudden he takes this water pitcher off the table and sort of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  sticks a leak in the water. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=16.72s)]
*  Oh gosh. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=18.0s)]
*  So what is that thing moving on your lapel on your pocket? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=22.88s)]
*  That's the debt. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=27.68s)]
*  That's my anxiety generator. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=28.64s)]
*  It's actually making me really anxious. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=31.44s)]
*  Is that real time? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=33.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=35.2s)]
*  So it's synced to treasury. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=35.52s)]
*  It gets the debt to the penny once a day and then it looks at what the debt was a year ago [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=37.2s)]
*  and it comes up with a rolling average debt per second and it interpolates on weekends [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=42.56s)]
*  and holidays when the treasury is not paying attention. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=46.88s)]
*  I am. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=49.84s)]
*  So I think you're the only one who wants to know. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=50.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=52.96s)]
*  And I want my colleagues to know and it's great to wear this thing in an elevator [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  with like Adam Schiff and he's got nowhere to look. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=57.04s)]
*  I once caught a female congresswoman staring at it and had to tell her my eyes were up here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=60.64s)]
*  She asked me why I didn't make a belt buckle out of it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Can you say who it was? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Because I like- [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=72.4s)]
*  No, I cannot. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=72.96s)]
*  Oh, well she's funny. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=74.08s)]
*  That's very impressive. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=75.36s)]
*  So what's the message of it? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  The message is this is urgent. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's hard to comprehend 14 digits of debt, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=82.16s)]
*  but when you see the last five digits are moving so fast you can't [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=86.08s)]
*  perceive them with your eyes, then you kind of understand, whoa, we have a problem here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=90.24s)]
*  I mean, it's a hundred thousand dollars a second roughly. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  So imagine we had this catapult and we were launching [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=98.48s)]
*  cyber trucks once a second into the ocean. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=102.24s)]
*  That's how much debt we're taking on continuously. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=105.2s)]
*  Now there is some good news. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=109.2s)]
*  I noticed last month it went down and I'm like, is my debt clock broken? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=110.4s)]
*  Why is it going down? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=116.08s)]
*  And I realized, oh, it's April 15th. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=116.96s)]
*  Everybody's paying their taxes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=119.36s)]
*  So the good news is we balanced it for a month. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  The bad news is April 15th is the only reason that happened. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=124.0s)]
*  And now the debt's going back up again. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=127.92s)]
*  So maybe when it gets so big, it becomes something that you have to ignore. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=129.84s)]
*  It's almost like if you fall off the wagon from drinking, you binge. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=135.44s)]
*  If you fall off your New Year's diet, you just eat the pizza and a grater. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=139.44s)]
*  It's like, why do you care? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=143.12s)]
*  You sort of go crazy and it feels like we're there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  I am trying to make people feel very uncomfortable. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=148.48s)]
*  I wear this on the floor of the house and people literally, they'll press the button [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  that says yay or nay. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=157.04s)]
*  I've argued we should relabel the voting button, spend and don't spend. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  They're red and green. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  If you got that far and can't read, I say it's like stop and go. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  But I've seen people press the spend button, then turn around and look at my debt badge [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  and ask, did it just go up? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  But I want them to realize there are consequences to what they're doing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=173.52s)]
*  because they have been, I think, as you said, just ignoring it, putting it off to the side. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=176.72s)]
*  It almost feels like it's so big that why even deal with it? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=180.88s)]
*  That's where we are. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=187.44s)]
*  I think a lot of lawmakers are apathetic. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=188.88s)]
*  They're like, well, we can't fix it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=191.6s)]
*  We're not going to fix it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=194.0s)]
*  We might as well indulge in it and I'll see what I can get. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=195.2s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=197.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=198.24s)]
*  So where does it end? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=198.88s)]
*  Right now, we're able to finance it because we're the world's reserve currency. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=200.56s)]
*  And when we print more money, which we're doing all the time, the Fed is doing that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=206.48s)]
*  We're actually taxing the world. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=211.76s)]
*  Everybody in the world who holds dollars gets like a 3% transaction fee. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=213.52s)]
*  I say we're kind of like the credit card at the gas station that gets 3% [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=218.64s)]
*  because you're using that credit card. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=222.32s)]
*  Well, we get 3% from inflation we cause because the world is using our currency. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=224.0s)]
*  We can do that as long as they use our currency. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=230.48s)]
*  But I think it's going to end at some point. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=232.64s)]
*  They're going to quit using our dollars as reserve currency. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=235.2s)]
*  I mean, I watched your interview with Putin and one of the things, whether you hate him or not, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=238.08s)]
*  one of the things he said that is true is when we sanctioned him, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=245.12s)]
*  before we sanctioned Russia, 70% of their transactions were in US dollars. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=248.08s)]
*  And after the sanctions, it's less than 20% of their transactions are in US dollars. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=253.2s)]
*  So what we're doing with all these sanctions, ironically, we're shooting ourselves in the foot [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=258.56s)]
*  every time we sanction a country and say you can't use our currency to have a transaction. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=262.96s)]
*  We're taking away our ability to charge them 3% for that transaction because when we print [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=268.4s)]
*  3% more dollars, we're just taking that money. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=274.0s)]
*  And we're also sending a really clear signal, which is the dollar is not safe for you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=276.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=280.08s)]
*  And it's the reserve currency because it's a safe haven because it's a stable country. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=280.88s)]
*  It's the most stable country in the world and we're not going to weaponize the dollar [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=284.48s)]
*  because that would be shooting ourselves. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=287.68s)]
*  But suddenly we are. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=289.76s)]
*  And they'll tolerate like 3% because we're not backed by dollars, we're backed by aircraft [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=291.36s)]
*  carriers right now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=296.8s)]
*  So they'll sort of tolerate that 3%. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=298.16s)]
*  But one of the things we recently did in Congress, we passed something called the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=300.48s)]
*  repo act where we said we're just going to seize all of Russia's sovereign assets in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=303.52s)]
*  the United States. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=308.56s)]
*  Well, it turns out a lot of that is treasury debt that they've agreed to buy so that they [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  can hold dollars. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=313.92s)]
*  And here's the problem with that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=315.28s)]
*  When people see that we've seized their money that they gave us in exchange for these [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=318.23999999999995s)]
*  treasury notes, then other countries won't want to buy our debt. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  It's already happening. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=326.96s)]
*  And the price of a long term bond that the treasury puts out will go, it's already gone [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=328.4s)]
*  above 4%. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=333.28s)]
*  It's like over 4.5%. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  They don't want to buy them anymore because we probably wouldn't seize Great Britain's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=336.32s)]
*  assets. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=341.84s)]
*  But I could see a seizing China's assets. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=342.4s)]
*  Why would, I mean, that seems like theft. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=344.96s)]
*  Just like take a country's assets. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=347.44s)]
*  I mean, that belongs to the people of the country, right? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=348.96s)]
*  It's not just Putin. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=350.64s)]
*  It is theft. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=352.0s)]
*  Like it's immoral. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=352.88s)]
*  But even if you're okay with the amorality or immorality of it, it's short-sighted because [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  eventually it'll catch up with us. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  So do any of the dumbos you work with understand that? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=362.4s)]
*  Did you say, wait a second, if we do this, first of all, it's wrong. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  And if we're going to be a beacon of light and order and justice in the world, we should [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  abide by those principles. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=373.12s)]
*  But even if you don't care about the, even if, as you said, you're immoral, like it's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=374.24s)]
*  self-defeating to do this. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=378.8s)]
*  Do they understand that? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  Some of them understand it, but it doesn't matter. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  They'll still vote for something like the repo act anyway, because it's popular. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=383.44s)]
*  And with whom? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=388.16s)]
*  With voters. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=389.92s)]
*  They think, yeah, take Russia's money. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=390.72s)]
*  Like, you know, let's take, yeah, yeah, that'd be great. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=393.04s)]
*  Let's take their money and use it in a war against them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=395.68s)]
*  It kind of feels good. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  But the problem is it's not moral in the long run and it won't work in the long run, even [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=400.0s)]
*  if you were okay with it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=405.44s)]
*  Why are we in a war with Russia? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=406.56s)]
*  I've never figured that out. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=407.84s)]
*  Why Russia? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=409.6s)]
*  It almost seems like they picked it off a mat. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=410.16s)]
*  Like, why would it be a war with Russia? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=411.68s)]
*  You know, what's interesting is we were in Afghanistan and I was tracking this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=413.36s)]
*  I talked to the special inspector general, John Sopko, about twice a year about the money [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=416.8s)]
*  that was being wasted in Afghanistan. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=422.72s)]
*  It was about $50 billion a year. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=424.48s)]
*  And I was glad to see us get out of Afghanistan, but kind of like feathering the clutch and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=427.44s)]
*  shifting gears, we just went from second gear to third gear because as soon as we quit spending [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  $50 billion a year in Afghanistan, we started spending more than $50 billion a year in Ukraine. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  There's a military industrial complex. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  They call it the Defense Industrial Base now in the United States. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=444.24s)]
*  They say we have to, they're hungry and we've got to keep them fed. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=447.68s)]
*  And since we don't have any of our own wars and we don't have a reason to deplete our [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=450.48s)]
*  stocks and our bombs and weapons that we have, we'll engage in these other things [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=454.64s)]
*  to keep them healthy and thriving. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=459.12s)]
*  In fact, the Biden administration even made that argument in a letter to Congress for [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  why we should do this supplemental foreign aid to Israel, to Ukraine, to Taiwan. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  They made the argument that the Defense Industrial Base needs to be strong and so we need to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=472.96s)]
*  spend this money. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=477.84s)]
*  And they gave a list of all the states in the United States that would benefit from [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=478.56s)]
*  this spending and that's why they said we should do it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=482.88s)]
*  But if you're, if, I mean, look, everyone who lives here wants to be proud of the country. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=484.88s)]
*  I always have been and I'm proud of its people still, but if your main export is death, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=488.96s)]
*  you know, that, I mean, what? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=496.0s)]
*  It doesn't work in the long run. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=498.32s)]
*  I mean, there is a blowback. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=499.6s)]
*  What's wrong? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=500.88s)]
*  We're engendering a lot of ill will. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=501.68s)]
*  Look, 10 years ago, even more recently than that, the only way we could get to the space [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=503.92s)]
*  station was on a Russian rocket. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=509.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=511.84s)]
*  And we, you know, we had a collaboration with them. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=512.24s)]
*  We were able to get to space that way and now we don't. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=515.04s)]
*  I mean, it's, and the bad thing that's, you know, like in the Middle East, Israel's creating [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=520.0s)]
*  tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people who are going to hate the United [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=527.76s)]
*  States and, you know, they're going to hate Israel also. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=532.72s)]
*  But because we're giving Israel the weapons to do what they're doing, we're creating a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=535.28s)]
*  lot of people who hate us in this country. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=539.84s)]
*  But we're told that it's essential to our national security to do that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=542.4s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=546.0s)]
*  No, I don't see that. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=547.6s)]
*  I mean, one of the reasons, like I said, the Biden ladder said, well, we need to keep our [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=549.44s)]
*  industrial base strong, so let's fund all these weapons and send them over. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=553.6s)]
*  But I don't see how it's strengthening our country. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=557.36s)]
*  In fact, we're getting weaker by doing it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=560.24s)]
*  So you've been, I think, the lone Republican to dissent from a lot of these votes. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=563.28s)]
*  How many votes have there been on this question? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=568.64s)]
*  And where have you voted on them? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=571.52s)]
*  Oh, I've tried to keep track. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=573.52s)]
*  There were something like 18 votes on Ukraine. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=575.52s)]
*  And I voted against every one of them since like 2014. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  When we started, you know, saber rattling, we do these nonbinding resolutions, whereas, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  you know, Russia's evil, you know, whereas we support democracy. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, even then, we knew that Ukraine was just corrupt as hell. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=594.24s)]
*  But, you know, I the most corrupt country in Europe by far. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=598.96s)]
*  Yeah. So I started, you know, there's been 16 or 20 votes on Ukraine. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=602.48s)]
*  I've been against all of those. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=607.2s)]
*  Just in the last seven months, there have been probably 30 votes on Israel in the Middle East. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=608.96s)]
*  30? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=615.2s)]
*  30. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=615.84s)]
*  How many votes on the US border during that time? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=617.52s)]
*  Oh, maybe, maybe four show votes that, you know, where we know they're going nowhere in the Senate. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=620.32s)]
*  Look, we haven't named 30 post offices. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=629.2s)]
*  Last month, we voted like 15 or 16 times on issues related to Israel. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I've been hit because I voted no on all of those. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=638.72s)]
*  Why do you because you hate Israel or is there another reason? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=642.24s)]
*  No, because I'm against sending our money overseas. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=644.88s)]
*  I'm against starting another proxy war. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=648.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm against sanctions because it's going to weaken the dollar. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=651.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm for free speech. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=655.36s)]
*  Like all of these resolutions run afoul of those things, and that's why I can't vote for them. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=657.12s)]
*  Tell us what the free speech part of it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=662.24s)]
*  So recently they brought a bill to Congress and this was actually a binding bill, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=664.88s)]
*  not a non-binding resolution. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=669.36s)]
*  Like this was going to have the effect of law and people would get, you know, prosecuted [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=670.96s)]
*  if they engaged in anti-Semitism on campuses. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=675.76s)]
*  And the problem with this bill is they use some international definition of anti-Semitism [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=679.68s)]
*  on a website somewhere. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=684.64s)]
*  My first question is, why don't you just put the definition in the bill? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=685.84s)]
*  Why are you pointing to somebody's URL in a piece of legislation? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  You are the Congress, right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=694.08s)]
*  Right. We are the right. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=695.28s)]
*  The laws we should be. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=696.08s)]
*  Instead, we're referencing a website, some that's not even, you know, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=698.0s)]
*  hosted in the United States. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  And so but so I went to this website and it's got a fairly short definition, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  but it's also got examples of things that would be considered anti-Semitism. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=709.84s)]
*  And some of these are actually passages in the New Testament, if you will, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=714.72s)]
*  would be banned by this international definition of anti-Semitism. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=719.36s)]
*  For instance, saying that Jews killed Jesus, which is, you know, in the Bible, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=723.52s)]
*  he was he was not welcome among his own people. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=730.48s)]
*  Okay. And so that would be anti-Semitism. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=733.28s)]
*  And if you engaged in that on campus or just offered that as a thought, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  let's say in a classroom, you would be anti-Semitic and you would run afoul [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=742.0s)]
*  of the Department of Education and some federal laws. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=746.88s)]
*  And, you know, there were other examples in there that were hard to believe. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=750.08s)]
*  For instance, comparing the policies of Israel to to the Nazi regime would be anti-Semitic. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=754.24s)]
*  But the question is, what if they're what if their policies ever became the same? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=761.44s)]
*  Is this a static definition? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=765.6s)]
*  Or what if we just have different opinions and your opinion is now a crime? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=767.52s)]
*  Right. I mean, even if it's abhorrent, even if it's wrong and stupid. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=772.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's still legal. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=775.44s)]
*  It should be. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=778.0s)]
*  You may have come to the obvious conclusion that the real debate is not between Republican [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=779.36s)]
*  and Democrat or socialist and capitalists right left. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=783.28s)]
*  The real battle is between people who are lying on purpose [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=788.64s)]
*  and people who are trying to tell you the truth. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=791.92s)]
*  It's between good and evil. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=794.8s)]
*  It's between honesty and falsehood. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=796.32s)]
*  And we hope we are on the former side. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=799.12s)]
*  That's why we created this network, the Tucker Carlson Network, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=802.0s)]
*  and we invite you to subscribe to it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=804.32s)]
*  You go to Tucker Carlson dot com slash podcast. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=806.08s)]
*  Our entire archive is there. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=809.2s)]
*  A lot of behind the scenes footage of what actually happens in this barn [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=810.56s)]
*  when only an iPhone is running. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=814.32s)]
*  Tucker Carlson dot com slash podcast. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=816.24s)]
*  You will not regret it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=820.32s)]
*  So your colleagues, I think it passed, right? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=822.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it passed with flying colors, but at least a few people woke up to this. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=825.52s)]
*  So but the members of Congress who go to church on Sunday, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=831.4399999999999s)]
*  who've just voted to ban the New Testament on campus, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=834.8s)]
*  make it illegal to quote from the New Testament, the Christian Bible. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=838.8s)]
*  How did they square that? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=843.2s)]
*  I think their voters let them get away with it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=846.64s)]
*  They don't have to square it unless they're. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=849.84s)]
*  Why would they want to do something like that? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=851.68s)]
*  Because there's a lot of pressure in Congress to vote for these things. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=854.24s)]
*  And our Republican leadership thinks they're so smart. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=858.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, we're in an election year and they want to bring up issues. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=861.0400000000001s)]
*  They want to put them in front of Congress and make us vote on them, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=864.24s)]
*  whether they're going anywhere in the Senate or not. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=868.0s)]
*  And they want to split the Democrats. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  They want to show that Republicans are united and then split the Democrats. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=872.4000000000001s)]
*  That's one of the reasons they do it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=875.7600000000001s)]
*  Another reason they do it is there's a foreign interest group called APAC [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=877.5200000000001s)]
*  that's got the ear of this current speaker and demanded 16 votes in April. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  On Israel or the Middle East. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=888.08s)]
*  We haven't had 16 votes in April on the United States in Congress. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=889.7600000000001s)]
*  So what's APAC? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=894.4000000000001s)]
*  APAC is the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=895.6800000000001s)]
*  And they didn't start out as a PAC in the sense of a political action committee, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=900.4000000000001s)]
*  but now they have a political action committee. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=906.1600000000001s)]
*  Ostensibly, it's a group of Americans who lobby on behalf of Israel. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=910.0s)]
*  They're for anything Israel. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=915.28s)]
*  And they're a very effective lobbying group. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=918.64s)]
*  They get in there. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=920.9599999999999s)]
*  They try to get me to write a white paper as a candidate, for instance, for Congress. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=922.9599999999999s)]
*  They almost get on Israel. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  And I wouldn't do it. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=931.92s)]
*  And they said, why? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=933.12s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't do homework for lobbyists, right? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=933.8399999999999s)]
*  I didn't like writing term papers at college. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=938.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm not writing one for you. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=940.48s)]
*  What did they say? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=943.76s)]
*  They said, oh, well, here, just copy Rand Paul's term paper and put your name on it. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=944.96s)]
*  We'll accept that. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=949.36s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I'm still not cribbing somebody else's homework to do homework. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=950.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm not turning in my homework for you. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=954.88s)]
*  You're laughing, but you know what? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=960.5600000000001s)]
*  I bet I may be the only Republican in Congress who hasn't done homework for APAC. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=962.72s)]
*  And it's just what it is, it's conditioning. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=968.24s)]
*  They want you to do something very simple and benign and for them. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=970.96s)]
*  They don't really grade your term paper. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=975.3599999999999s)]
*  They just want to know that you'll do something for them. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=977.5999999999999s)]
*  And if you'll do something for them as a candidate, you're more likely to do something for them [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=979.8399999999999s)]
*  as a congressman when you get in there. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=984.2399999999999s)]
*  So my rift started out in 2012 when I refused to turn in an Israel term paper. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=987.1999999999999s)]
*  And how did they respond to that? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=993.04s)]
*  Well, they kind of got in my race a little too late there in the beginning, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=995.5999999999999s)]
*  because it was hard to tell that I was actually going to win. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1000.88s)]
*  And when they saw I was going to win, that's when they tried to get me to do the term paper. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1003.28s)]
*  They didn't have a political action committee at the time. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1007.8399999999999s)]
*  They couldn't spend hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars against me at that time. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1011.12s)]
*  It was just sort of like a whisper campaign to try to, hey, don't vote for him, blah, blah, blah. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1016.0s)]
*  Because at that point, they sensed I wouldn't do what they wanted. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1023.1999999999999s)]
*  But what did they whisper against you? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1026.0s)]
*  What were they saying about you? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1027.52s)]
*  Well, they would do it through, for instance, churches, evangelical churches. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1029.3600000000001s)]
*  They've got an organization called Christians United for Israel, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1033.92s)]
*  where they've sort of co-opted evangelicals. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1037.44s)]
*  People think it's a grassroots movement in Kentucky. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1041.1200000000001s)]
*  It's actually a top-down movement from APAC, so that people who aren't even Jewish [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1043.76s)]
*  will feel like they've got to support Israel, you know, no matter what. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1049.1200000000001s)]
*  And even if it's a secular state that funds abortions, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1054.24s)]
*  they just sort of forget that part and we've got to fund Israel. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1057.52s)]
*  So they have networks, so it's more than just about the money. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1061.68s)]
*  So you get elected despite their efforts. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1065.28s)]
*  And then what happens? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1070.0800000000002s)]
*  Do you talk to them after that? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  And by the way, let me just put a little footnote here. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1072.4s)]
*  I'm not against Israel. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1075.68s)]
*  I've never voted to sanction Israel. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1077.28s)]
*  I've never said anything particularly critical of Israel, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1080.0s)]
*  you know, other than, for instance, right now they're bombing. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1084.72s)]
*  They've killed 1% of the civilian population in Gaza. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1088.64s)]
*  That's concerning to me. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1091.44s)]
*  So what do they do now? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1094.5600000000002s)]
*  You get elected 2012. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1096.88s)]
*  Do you hear from them again? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1098.8000000000002s)]
*  I vote my conscience, which they won't tolerate. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1100.3200000000002s)]
*  So they ran with their 501C4 before they had a super PAC. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  They were running educational advocacy ads against me saying that, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1110.24s)]
*  you know, I'm bad on Israel. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1115.6s)]
*  They didn't say don't vote for him. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1116.8799999999999s)]
*  They just said he's a bad guy. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1118.24s)]
*  And so I said, all right, well, you're not welcome in my office anymore [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1120.8799999999999s)]
*  because for years I invited them into my office. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1124.0s)]
*  Let's talk this through. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1126.72s)]
*  Let me explain to you. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1127.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm a libertarian leaning Republican. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1129.28s)]
*  I don't vote for foreign aid for anybody. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1131.4399999999998s)]
*  So don't be offended when I don't vote for your foreign aid. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1134.08s)]
*  I don't vote for wars anywhere. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1136.9599999999998s)]
*  So don't be offended if I tell you that. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1138.64s)]
*  I'm for free speech, even if it's abhorrent. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1140.64s)]
*  And, you know, we used to talk, but now they're banned from my office. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1144.8000000000002s)]
*  Situation from bad to worse. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1148.48s)]
*  This election cycle, they spent $400,000 against me. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1150.8000000000002s)]
*  $90,000 last fall running TV ads in my district and Facebook ads and whatnot, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1154.48s)]
*  trying to equate me with the squad. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1160.0s)]
*  And then this most recently, in fact, as I'm speaking to you today, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1162.48s)]
*  even though my election is over, they're still running [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1167.44s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of dollars of negative ads. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1170.0800000000002s)]
*  It's a little weird, though, because as you said, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1172.0800000000002s)]
*  you're probably the only Republican in the House [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1174.16s)]
*  who hasn't done homework for them, who isn't on their side. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1176.24s)]
*  And but that's OK. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1180.72s)]
*  I mean, you can have, you know, you're a libertarian oriented Republican [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1182.0800000000002s)]
*  from Northern Kentucky. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1186.0800000000002s)]
*  You're probably not going to single handedly determine our foreign policy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1187.76s)]
*  So I think you should, but you don't. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1193.68s)]
*  And you're not going to. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1194.0s)]
*  So why do they care? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1195.28s)]
*  Why not just let Thomas Massey be Thomas Massey in Northern Kentucky? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1196.8s)]
*  Like, why? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1200.08s)]
*  Why the need to crush you? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1200.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1202.8s)]
*  I think it's they don't want one horse out of the barn. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1203.76s)]
*  If one person starts speaking the truth, they're afraid it could be contagious, perhaps. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1206.32s)]
*  Or it's like a new car. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1211.2s)]
*  They go to Mike Johnson. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1212.8s)]
*  They say we want a Cadillac Escalade with pearl white paint. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1214.32s)]
*  And here's, you know, here's the rims we want. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1219.68s)]
*  And Mike Johnson puts that bill on the floor. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1222.08s)]
*  It passes with a unanimous vote, except for one guy votes no. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1224.64s)]
*  And I think they feel like it's a scratch on their car. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1228.88s)]
*  They wanted a brand new car and it got scratched by this guy named Massey. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1231.76s)]
*  They were going to drive it over to the Senate and ask for unanimous consent. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1235.8400000000001s)]
*  But now the senators are say, wait, why this wasn't unanimous in the House? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1239.1200000000001s)]
*  Why should we do it unanimously in the Senate? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1243.68s)]
*  And it starts raising questions. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1246.0s)]
*  And I think that's why they get mad. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1247.44s)]
*  What I find interesting is that it's not just that they disagree with your [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1249.76s)]
*  views, which they do. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1254.4s)]
*  And I think they have an absolute right to disagree with anybody's views. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1255.2s)]
*  We all do. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1258.0800000000002s)]
*  But they've called you a bigot and they call you an anti-Semite and say you're a [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1259.3600000000001s)]
*  hater and try to destroy your character. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1265.1200000000001s)]
*  That seems like a very different level of response to me. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1266.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1270.48s)]
*  They there's no need to do that. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1270.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm not anti-Semitic. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1272.48s)]
*  I don't have an anti-Semitic hair in my head. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1273.92s)]
*  OK, it's I mean, I don't like APAC anymore. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1276.5600000000002s)]
*  Like I used to be neutral toward APAC. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1281.76s)]
*  But I have no antagonistic feelings toward Jewish people. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1284.56s)]
*  I am the last thing. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1290.72s)]
*  I think I'm probably the least xenophobic person in Congress. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1292.32s)]
*  I mean, these are the guys that my colleagues want to sanction everybody, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1295.36s)]
*  you know, declare them terrorist states, you know, come up with these strongly [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1299.6s)]
*  worded resolutions. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1303.2s)]
*  I don't vote for any of that crap. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1304.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1305.44s)]
*  I'll unless somebody does harm to me, I'm not going to call them anything. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1306.0s)]
*  So I get called names just for staying out of all of this political posture. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1310.72s)]
*  That's disgusting, though, isn't it? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1314.96s)]
*  You know, I guess that's your character. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1317.76s)]
*  They can disagree with your views, but to call you like the worst thing you can be [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1319.2s)]
*  in America, like that's disgusting. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1323.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, I have a thick skin. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1326.88s)]
*  Apparently. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  And here's the good news, Tucker. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1330.4s)]
*  My constituents aren't falling for it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1332.72s)]
*  Two weeks ago, I just had a primary and got 76 percent of the vote [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1335.0400000000002s)]
*  with a pack running hundreds of thousand dollars of ads. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1338.88s)]
*  So it's not working against me. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1342.48s)]
*  I think it's short-sighted on their, you know, on their side to do this. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1345.2800000000002s)]
*  They're just burning money, but they're trying to make an example of me. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1350.16s)]
*  But they're also exposing their weakness. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1353.76s)]
*  I think they are. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1356.24s)]
*  I think they've exposed a real weakness here. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1357.0400000000002s)]
*  And, you know, it used to be just me voting against some of these resolutions. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1359.3600000000001s)]
*  But recently, where they tried to ban passages in the New Testament, I think we got like [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1363.6000000000001s)]
*  almost two dozen Republicans who say, wait, hold on there. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1368.16s)]
*  I think there's a fundamental question. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1371.44s)]
*  So the Biden administration has put a bunch of people in jail for violating something [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1373.68s)]
*  called FARA, the Foreign Agent Registration Act 1936 ish. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1376.96s)]
*  It's been on the books for, you know, 90 years and it's never been enforced ever [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1380.88s)]
*  until recently, until really the Trump era and Biden era. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1386.3200000000002s)]
*  So but the law requires people who lobby on behalf of foreign governments to register. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1391.44s)]
*  It was that simple. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1396.3200000000002s)]
*  And this is the largest lobby in the most effective lobby in the United States on [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1397.84s)]
*  behalf of a foreign government. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1401.44s)]
*  Are they registered with FARA? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1402.32s)]
*  They're not, but they should be. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1403.52s)]
*  Well, how can that be? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1405.2s)]
*  How can they put Paul Manafort in jail, which they did on a FARA violation and a bunch of [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1406.96s)]
*  other people in jail on FARA violations, but the largest and most effective and most feared [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1412.6399999999999s)]
*  foreign lobby working for a foreign government doesn't have to register under the law? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1417.2s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1421.2s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1422.6399999999999s)]
*  Don't make me take their side, but I'll explain as best as I can what their argument is. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1423.28s)]
*  I mean, maybe I'm wrong. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1428.32s)]
*  Maybe we should take their side. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1429.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1430.24s)]
*  Well, I'm going to agree with you at a second, but let me at least offer what I think is [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1430.6399999999999s)]
*  their argument. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1434.96s)]
*  They would say we are Americans. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1436.32s)]
*  You know, the members of APAC are Americans and they have the right to free speech. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1439.04s)]
*  Paul Manafort's an American. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1445.44s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1446.72s)]
*  Yeah, so there's the good rebuttal is FARA applies not to foreigners, to foreign agents [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1447.6799999999998s)]
*  of foreign principles, agents of foreign principles. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1454.3999999999999s)]
*  Americans lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1456.7199999999998s)]
*  Correct. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1459.1999999999998s)]
*  So this is, APAC is exactly what FARA is meant for. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1459.6799999999998s)]
*  Now they would say, and we have the First Amendment, right? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1462.9599999999998s)]
*  Okay, well, I agree with you there, but we also have election laws and to the, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1465.76s)]
*  it's disclosure, right? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1471.76s)]
*  FARA doesn't say you can't say Thomas Massie's, you know, an ignorant hillbilly. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1474.24s)]
*  You're allowed to say that if you want to, but we just want to check where your money's [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1479.3600000000001s)]
*  coming from. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1483.2s)]
*  Tell us where it's coming from, what you're spending it on, and if you are lobbying on [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1483.8400000000001s)]
*  behalf of a foreign country. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1488.3200000000002s)]
*  So they should be, now to your point, they should be registered with FARA. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1490.8s)]
*  This is what FARA is, is where there's gray area, where it's an American representing [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1495.44s)]
*  a foreign country. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1500.24s)]
*  Let's look and see if you're getting any money from that foreign country. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1501.8400000000001s)]
*  Are you a dual citizen with that foreign country? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1505.2s)]
*  Are you being directed by, for instance, is Netanyahu speaking to your group, advising [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1508.88s)]
*  you on your next move? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1514.0s)]
*  Are you getting money from the military industrial complex? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1516.64s)]
*  Because to understand APAC, I think it's easiest to model them as a military industrial lobby. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1520.16s)]
*  Like their biggest thing is they want more equipment, more military equipment from the [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1528.96s)]
*  United States going to Israel. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1535.84s)]
*  In fact, when they used to be allowed in my office, the thing they, the argument they [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1538.24s)]
*  would make is, oh, we're just stimulating the U.S. military industrial complex because [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1543.2s)]
*  every single penny of the 3.8 billion that they nominally get, now they're getting way [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1549.36s)]
*  more than that, but that Israel nominally gets goes to U.S. military contractors. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1554.24s)]
*  Now that didn't make me warm and fuzzy, okay, but that is their argument. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1560.64s)]
*  If you notice what they advocate for, I think sometimes they advocate for things that even [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1564.96s)]
*  Israelis wouldn't advocate for. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1570.24s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1572.16s)]
*  They would, I think, be okay with a war with Iran, like an all-out apocalyptic war with [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1573.44s)]
*  Iran, whereas there are people in Israel who say, whoa, hold on a second. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1578.96s)]
*  We'd rather not have a war with Iran, but AIPAC does things that lead us in that direction. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1582.8799999999999s)]
*  So they're kind of like what the NRA is to gun owners, AIPAC is to Israel, or what the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1588.32s)]
*  Farm Bureau is to farmers, AIPAC is to Israel. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1595.28s)]
*  In other words- [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1598.56s)]
*  Represents a faction. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1598.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1600.1599999999999s)]
*  They represent a faction, but usually a corporate faction. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1600.3999999999999s)]
*  And they're using the imprimatur of grassroots that they've diluted or confused into [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1605.76s)]
*  bullying congressmen. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1612.32s)]
*  And the NRA does that and Farm Bureau does that. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1613.76s)]
*  I'm picking on some other right-wing groups here. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1616.4s)]
*  Well, for sure. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1619.36s)]
*  And by the way, I think there are probably a lot of things that AIPAC is for that. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1620.32s)]
*  I'm for and Farm Bureau, NRA, same thing. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1623.44s)]
*  I just, the idea of a foreign government playing in our political campaigns openly- [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1627.68s)]
*  Openly in that they're showing you they're doing it, but opaquely in that you can't [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1634.88s)]
*  track it because they're not registered. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1642.0s)]
*  Is there any other Republican who has your views on this? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1644.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, I have Republicans who come to me on the floor and say, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1648.4s)]
*  I wish I could vote with you today. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1652.64s)]
*  Yours is the right vote, but I would just take too much flack back home. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1654.72s)]
*  And I have Republicans who come to me and say, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1660.24s)]
*  that's wrong what AIPAC is doing to you. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1663.84s)]
*  Let me talk to my AIPAC person. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1666.08s)]
*  By the way, everybody but me has an AIPAC person. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1668.56s)]
*  What does that mean, an AIPAC person? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1672.0s)]
*  It's like your babysitter, your AIPAC babysitter who is always talking to you for AIPAC. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1673.44s)]
*  They're probably a constituent in your district, but they are, you know, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1679.84s)]
*  firmly embedded in AIPAC. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1685.04s)]
*  Every member has something like this? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1687.68s)]
*  I don't know how it works on the Democrat side, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1690.88s)]
*  but that's how it works on the Republican side. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1693.92s)]
*  And when they come to DC, you go have lunch with them. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1696.72s)]
*  And they've got your cell number and you have conversations with them. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1700.24s)]
*  So I've had like- [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1704.24s)]
*  That's absolutely crazy. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1706.0800000000002s)]
*  I've had four members of Congress say, I'll talk to my AIPAC person. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1707.52s)]
*  It's really what we call them, my AIPAC guy. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1712.56s)]
*  I'll talk to my AIPAC guy and see if I can get him to, you know, dial those ads back. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1715.84s)]
*  Why have I never heard this before? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  It doesn't benefit anybody. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1723.1999999999998s)]
*  Why would they want to tell their constituents that they've basically got a buddy system [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1725.28s)]
*  with somebody who's representing a foreign country? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1730.8s)]
*  It doesn't benefit the congressmen for people to know that, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1734.9599999999998s)]
*  so they're not going to tell you that. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1737.4399999999998s)]
*  Have you seen any other country do anything like this? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1740.9599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1742.8s)]
*  Russia. Russia obviously determines the outcome of our elections. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1743.44s)]
*  We keep hearing that. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1746.48s)]
*  Does anyone have a Putin guy that they talk to? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1748.0800000000002s)]
*  Not only do they not have a Putin guy, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1751.1200000000001s)]
*  look, they don't have a Britain guy. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1753.76s)]
*  They don't have an Australian guy. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1757.6000000000001s)]
*  They don't have a Germany dude. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1760.72s)]
*  Like, it's the only country that does this, that has somebody that like, uniformly- [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1762.8s)]
*  I guarantee there's some spreadsheet at AIPAC where, you know, the AIPAC dude who's matched [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1770.0s)]
*  up with the congressman is there, and then all the congressman's votes on the issue. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1777.84s)]
*  Oh, has the congressman been to Israel? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1782.08s)]
*  They pay for trips for congressmen and their spouses to go to Israel. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1785.28s)]
*  I may be- I mean, I'm not the only Republican who hasn't taken the AIPAC trip to Israel, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1788.96s)]
*  but I'm probably one of a dozen that hasn't taken that trip, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1795.68s)]
*  and the other ones just haven't got around to it. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1799.04s)]
*  What's the trip like, do you know? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1801.44s)]
*  It's kind of like, I think, vacation-y. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1803.76s)]
*  You go see the wall, you go see the, you know, the sights, things like that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1806.32s)]
*  It's such a great- I must say, it's such a great country, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1812.6399999999999s)]
*  Jerusalem especially, it's just such a wonderful place that that's got to have a big effect. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1815.6s)]
*  You go, like, swim in the Dead Sea. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1820.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I've done that. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1822.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1823.44s)]
*  Not on an AIPAC trip, but I would recommend it to anyone. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1823.76s)]
*  Are you sure it wasn't an AIPAC trip? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1826.24s)]
*  Paid for it myself. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1828.32s)]
*  No, I mean, it's just funny. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1829.52s)]
*  I mean, I am like a legit lover of Israel, of the place Israel, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1831.36s)]
*  I like the people, and I love the food, and like, the whole thing is so great. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1835.68s)]
*  But that's distinct from the government of Israel, which is just a foreign government. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1839.84s)]
*  My sense is the people are very entrepreneurial. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1843.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1846.96s)]
*  That they're publicly minded, you know, they care about their country, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1847.44s)]
*  that they're generally good people, right? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1854.8799999999999s)]
*  That's certainly been my experience in trips there, for sure, it's great. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1856.64s)]
*  It's just that's, I mean, I think it's probably one of my favorite, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1860.0800000000002s)]
*  maybe my all-time favorite place to go with my family. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1862.96s)]
*  But that's just a completely different thing from taking orders from its government. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1867.0400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1871.76s)]
*  I mean, right? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1872.72s)]
*  Now, again, they'll say these are American citizens who are, you know, coordinating all- [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1874.0800000000002s)]
*  It's just, again, this is almost a rhetorical question, but in your, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1878.88s)]
*  whatever, 12, 14 years in Congress, 12 years, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1882.8000000000002s)]
*  have you ever seen any indication that Russia is influencing election outcomes or candidates or [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1886.88s)]
*  members? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1892.0s)]
*  Not in a quiet way. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1893.68s)]
*  Like, you know, they'll put out statements. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1896.3200000000002s)]
*  Russia obviously has, Russia Today, RT. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1900.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's been banned, but yeah. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1903.44s)]
*  I like, you know, Kentucky Fried Chicken, of which I'm a big fan, being from Kentucky, right? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1905.1200000000001s)]
*  They realized that fried became sort of a pejorative, and people didn't want to eat [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1910.16s)]
*  fried food, so they changed the name to KFC, so you don't have to say fried. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1914.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1919.2s)]
*  Russia Today changed their name to RT, so you don't have to say Russia. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1919.76s)]
*  But there's a strong analogy there. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1924.24s)]
*  But I mean, there are efforts. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1926.1599999999999s)]
*  You'd be a fool to think that they're not trying to influence things here, just like we are there. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1928.6399999999999s)]
*  We, you know, we have, what is it, Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1934.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1940.72s)]
*  I mean, we spend a billion dollars, well over a billion dollars on the foreign propaganda [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1941.52s)]
*  that's out in the open that we know about, right? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1946.0s)]
*  So there are foreigners spending money on propaganda over here as well. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1948.88s)]
*  I don't want to say they're not involved, but people don't say, oh, I need to go talk to my Russia guy. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1952.48s)]
*  But you've never, like, in the cloakroom or on the floor at dinner, you've never heard [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1957.68s)]
*  another Republican member say, I'd love to vote for this, but Putin doesn't want me to. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1961.68s)]
*  I have never heard that. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1965.3600000000001s)]
*  You haven't? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1966.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1967.44s)]
*  What about China? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1968.32s)]
*  No, there's, I mean, unless it's a spy sleeping with a Democrat, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1970.16s)]
*  there's some of that going on. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1975.68s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not in public. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1976.96s)]
*  So how do you think, it's just interesting because you're clearly not a bigot. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1978.96s)]
*  I think it's very obvious. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1984.56s)]
*  And they've called you one and they've spent millions of dollars against you over the years, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1986.4s)]
*  and it has had no effect. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1991.92s)]
*  You get re-elected in the primary in the 70s. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1993.2s)]
*  So like, why are they still spending against you in your state, statewide? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=1996.0800000000002s)]
*  And can you just continue to serve in Congress while disobeying? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2000.64s)]
*  Well, they say that they don't want me to run statewide. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2005.3600000000001s)]
*  They're worried that I'll run for McConnell's seat. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2009.3600000000001s)]
*  And so they're trying to send me a message. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2012.16s)]
*  That's what they would tell you. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2013.92s)]
*  But why? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2017.68s)]
*  I don't know what the message is. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2019.28s)]
*  Maybe it's a little presumptuous to decide to get to be. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2020.64s)]
*  I've never said that I'm running for the Senate, right? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2023.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2026.0s)]
*  I'm pretty much disinterested in it, personally and publicly. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2026.72s)]
*  But just in case, they're running ads statewide. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2031.76s)]
*  Now, mind you, there are six congressional districts in Kentucky, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2034.72s)]
*  and I only represent one of them. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2037.68s)]
*  They're running the ads in all six congressional districts, just in case. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2039.36s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2044.32s)]
*  What do you think of Mitch McConnell after all these years of being in the delegation with him? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2045.28s)]
*  He's a shrewd guy. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2050.16s)]
*  Yep. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2051.2799999999997s)]
*  He's quick. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2051.84s)]
*  He's... Let me give you an example of how quick he is. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2052.96s)]
*  So we had a Congressman Jamie Comer who's now chair of the oversight committee. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2057.76s)]
*  He got elected in a special election, which means you come in in the middle of a term, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2061.2s)]
*  and you have to boot up with no staff. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2065.12s)]
*  And so it's kind of disorienting. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2067.52s)]
*  So Mitch McConnell had an event for Jamie Comer on his first day in Congress. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2071.28s)]
*  It was in a townhouse with like 200 lobbyists. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2076.64s)]
*  By the way, I'm never going to get invited to one of these now that I tell you the story. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2079.12s)]
*  And so Jamie's there and McConnell goes, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2083.36s)]
*  I believe Jamie took his first vote tonight. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2086.4s)]
*  And... [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2089.84s)]
*  That is such a perfect imitation. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2090.96s)]
*  And I wasn't supposed to speak, but I interrupted Senator McConnell, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2093.52s)]
*  who was at the time the majority leader. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2097.2s)]
*  And I said, yes, Senator McConnell, he did take his first vote. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2099.68s)]
*  And I know he has no staff. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2103.36s)]
*  So I advise Jamie, when you walk into the chamber, look at how I vote, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2105.12s)]
*  and then vote the other way and you'll be just fine. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2110.24s)]
*  And every, you know, 200 lobbyists thought it was a pretty good joke and they were laughing. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2113.6s)]
*  And as the laughter died down, McConnell goes, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2118.4s)]
*  well, Thomas, I'm glad you and I are giving Jamie the same advice. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2121.36s)]
*  And then the place just the walls are most... [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2128.24s)]
*  Now he's good. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2130.64s)]
*  He's good that way. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2131.52s)]
*  But I think it's time for new leadership in the Senate. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2134.72s)]
*  I mean, he's obviously, it's way past time. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2137.52s)]
*  And this is just a fact. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2140.56s)]
*  I'll say it. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2141.84s)]
*  I'll get in trouble for saying it. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2142.4s)]
*  I'm in races in Kentucky. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2145.68s)]
*  So we poll things in case, you know, we polled Trump's popularity. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2147.12s)]
*  We polled the Senator's popularity in case they get involved in your race. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2150.8s)]
*  Senator McConnell's favorabilities are lower among Republican primary voters [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2155.04s)]
*  than our Democrat governor's favorabilities. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2160.56s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2162.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2163.52s)]
*  Lower than Governor Beshear? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2163.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2164.8s)]
*  Beshear's around 40% among Republican primary voters and McConnell's around 30%. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2165.2s)]
*  Well deserved. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2171.12s)]
*  Well deserved. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2172.16s)]
*  So I'm glad to hear that because I like Kentucky and I think its voters are sensible. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2172.8799999999997s)]
*  What do you think it counts for in the final months and years of his public career, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2179.2s)]
*  his public statements that all that matters is Ukraine? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2184.64s)]
*  What is that? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2189.52s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2190.3999999999996s)]
*  By the way, I have so many fights in the House [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2191.3599999999997s)]
*  that I try to avoid every fight in the Senate that I can. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2194.08s)]
*  You're trying to draw me in and I love you and I'll indulge these questions, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2197.68s)]
*  but for 12 years my strategy has been pick my fights in the House. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2201.84s)]
*  Smart. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2206.0s)]
*  Let Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Ted Cruz and, you know, J.D. Vance, Rick Scott, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2206.48s)]
*  let those guys figure out the Senate because I haven't been able to fix the House. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2213.04s)]
*  So I'm damn sure not going to be able to fix the Senate. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2216.88s)]
*  But it's just interesting. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2220.24s)]
*  Okay, taking McConnell out of it and even the Senate out of it, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2222.3199999999997s)]
*  but some of the committee chairman in the House, for example, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2226.48s)]
*  seem like Ukraine is all that matters to them. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2229.52s)]
*  And there's, of course, the questions you noted of donations from Lockheed, etc., [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2233.12s)]
*  the military industrial complex, but it almost seems messianic to me. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2237.8399999999997s)]
*  It seems heartfelt to me. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2241.3599999999997s)]
*  It seems sincere that they think that this is all that matters, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2242.56s)]
*  winning this war against Russia. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2246.48s)]
*  Do you have any sense of why they feel that way? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2248.16s)]
*  I don't. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2250.7999999999997s)]
*  And the hardest ones to understand are people like Mike Johnson, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2251.68s)]
*  who used to be against sending more money to Ukraine. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2255.52s)]
*  But now that he's the speaker, he's like you said, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2260.56s)]
*  he seems strongly convicted that we should be sending money there. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2263.04s)]
*  Almost like it's a religious calling or something. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2268.16s)]
*  It seems totally real to me. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2270.4799999999996s)]
*  It doesn't seem fake. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2271.9199999999996s)]
*  I've heard the argument. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2273.2s)]
*  I think it's immoral, but I've heard the argument that, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2274.8799999999997s)]
*  oh, this is a great deal. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2277.52s)]
*  We just spend money and we're grinding up Russia's capacity to wage war, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2278.8s)]
*  particularly lots of Russians are dying. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2283.84s)]
*  And so we're told that's a good thing. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2286.2400000000002s)]
*  Since the Cold War began, we've been taught that [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2289.44s)]
*  it would be good for Russia to be diminished. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2292.5600000000004s)]
*  But they've gone so far as to say Russians dying, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2295.2000000000003s)]
*  to the tune of 300,000 casualties, they say, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2301.2000000000003s)]
*  is just such a great thing that we need to keep this thing going. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2304.4s)]
*  And my answer to that is, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2308.56s)]
*  why don't you tell us the Ukrainian casualties? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2311.12s)]
*  I have been in classified settings with CIA, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2314.64s)]
*  the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2320.72s)]
*  not their assistants, but those people in the room. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2324.16s)]
*  And they're bragging about how many Russians have died and been injured. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2328.16s)]
*  And I asked them how many Ukrainians have died and been injured. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2332.4s)]
*  And they claimed they didn't know. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2335.92s)]
*  I mean, that's just a flat out lie. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2338.0s)]
*  And they said they would get back to me. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2340.1600000000003s)]
*  And they've never gotten back to me. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2341.84s)]
*  Like, not only is our Americans being fed propaganda about this war, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2343.92s)]
*  Congress is being fed propaganda by our State Department [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2348.88s)]
*  and our Secretary of Defense and our intelligence agencies. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2352.48s)]
*  And you can just ask a few questions in these classified hearings. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2356.32s)]
*  If nothing else, my colleagues should be convicted of a lack of curiosity. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2359.76s)]
*  Like, they sit there and they believe everything they're told [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2364.4s)]
*  because these are supposed to be the authorities and they know things we don't. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2367.04s)]
*  But you can expose them with two or three questions, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2370.56s)]
*  like how many Ukrainians have died? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2372.7200000000003s)]
*  And they refuse to answer. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2374.7200000000003s)]
*  I've asked that very same question to Mike Johnson, actually, directly. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2375.6800000000003s)]
*  But I've also asked him and a number of committee chairmen, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2380.2400000000002s)]
*  just in personal conversations, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2383.28s)]
*  do you believe your intel briefings? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2385.92s)]
*  Because only a child would believe an intel briefing. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2387.52s)]
*  Take it at face value, there may be truth in there. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2390.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2392.0s)]
*  Maybe largely true, but you're being spun, you're being manipulated. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2392.4s)]
*  And if you don't know that, then you're a moron. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2396.4s)]
*  But they seem to believe them. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2399.92s)]
*  They, because they have no other reference. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2402.7200000000003s)]
*  And then here's what else happens, Tucker. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2405.2000000000003s)]
*  When you go into a classified setting, like a skiff, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2407.52s)]
*  you lock up your phone, you take off your Fitbit, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2411.28s)]
*  you take every electronic device. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2414.4s)]
*  They even make me take off my debt badge. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2416.4s)]
*  What? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2418.4s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2418.96s)]
*  Do you feel naked? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2419.6800000000003s)]
*  I feel exposed. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2420.96s)]
*  I do feel naked if I'm not wearing this. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2423.84s)]
*  I've been wearing it for a year, every day of my life. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2425.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2428.2400000000002s)]
*  But they make you, they strip you of every outside reference. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2430.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2434.4s)]
*  And now your staff is not allowed in that meeting either. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2435.04s)]
*  Remember, congressmen, our primary roles are like raising money, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2439.12s)]
*  being friendly to constituents, you know, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2444.72s)]
*  putting on a good face, campaigning. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2448.1600000000003s)]
*  And then, you know, once a day or maybe twice a day, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2450.32s)]
*  we roll in there and press the vote buttons based on what staff advises you. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2453.44s)]
*  Well, when you go into a skiff, you don't have your smartphone, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2457.6800000000003s)]
*  so you're not very smart. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2460.5600000000004s)]
*  They start using acronyms that you don't know, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2461.92s)]
*  remember what the acronym stands for. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2464.5600000000004s)]
*  You can't just like, okay, what's the IDGFBZ? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2466.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2470.0s)]
*  I must be stupid. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2470.88s)]
*  But, you know, if you were in a regular setting, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2473.0400000000004s)]
*  you just pull your phone out and like, oh, okay, that's what that is. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2475.44s)]
*  I know what that is. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2478.0s)]
*  And then you also can't ask your staff a question while you're in that setting. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2479.04s)]
*  You know, we have legislative staffers who handle certain specific areas. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2483.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2488.56s)]
*  You can't bring them in. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2489.2000000000003s)]
*  And then when you go back to the office, you can't tell them what you heard. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2490.32s)]
*  So it's really quite an experience. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2494.2400000000002s)]
*  It's sort of, you know, it's a deprivation experience of any outside reference. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2497.84s)]
*  So it's designed to produce Stockholm Syndrome, it sounds like. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2502.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2505.6s)]
*  And when you get in there, they really don't give you classified information. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2506.08s)]
*  I say there's three levels of classification in the SCIF. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2509.6800000000003s)]
*  There's Facebook level, there's a Twitter level, and there's New York Times level. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2512.56s)]
*  Like, and the New York Times level is the highest level of classification. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2517.6s)]
*  I mean, it's you're getting to the good stuff when they're telling you [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2521.76s)]
*  what's in the New York Times that week. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2524.96s)]
*  Have you ever heard anything you thought was genuinely secret? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2527.6s)]
*  Occasionally, just a few times. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2531.1200000000003s)]
*  And obviously, I can't say what that is. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2532.96s)]
*  But they slip up and commit candor occasionally in there. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2534.96s)]
*  And you're like, whoa, I didn't know that. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2538.88s)]
*  You know, nothing like what's at Area 51. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2541.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2543.76s)]
*  But occasionally, you're like, what do people think is at Area 51, by the way? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2544.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2548.64s)]
*  I'm not a. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2549.2s)]
*  You guys passed this law, the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2550.64s)]
*  and then they never disclosed anything. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2554.2400000000002s)]
*  What is that? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2556.16s)]
*  Not my area of expertise. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2557.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2559.04s)]
*  Don't know. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2559.52s)]
*  But do members of Congress ever say, wait a second, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2560.4s)]
*  we're a co-equal branch for the legislative branch. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2563.12s)]
*  We have as much power as the president collectively. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2565.12s)]
*  And you can't keep this stuff secret from us. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2567.68s)]
*  You're not allowed to do that. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2569.44s)]
*  But see, like I have this in hearings all the time. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2570.7999999999997s)]
*  I'll ask the ATF director, this just this happened just last week. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2574.0s)]
*  Dedelbach or I'll ask Merrick Garland something or Christopher Wray. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2578.0s)]
*  Like I've asked all them this and they give you the same answer. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2583.04s)]
*  It's longstanding DOJ policy not to comment on ongoing investigations. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2586.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2593.52s)]
*  That's fine to tell a reporter, but you can't tell the branch of government [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2593.92s)]
*  that created you that that funded you. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2598.32s)]
*  You can't tell them that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2600.96s)]
*  That's why the omnibus was so disappointing to me, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2602.4s)]
*  is the only way these three letter agencies are going to come to heel [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2606.7200000000003s)]
*  is if we cut their funding in some specific area. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2609.84s)]
*  I've joked we could just withhold one toner cartridge for one printer at the FBI, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2612.88s)]
*  and they would come over with a whole binder full of information. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2617.68s)]
*  But we can't even bring ourselves to deprive them of a toner cartridge. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2620.96s)]
*  So we put $200 million for new FBI building in the omnibus bill. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2625.12s)]
*  And to their credit, Jim Jordan and Jamie Comer didn't vote for that. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2630.64s)]
*  And they're chairman of committees, but they are completely frustrated [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2635.52s)]
*  with the fact that the FBI just thumbs their noses. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2639.12s)]
*  So is that the speaker who allowed that to happen? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2641.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, he absolutely allowed it to happen. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2643.6800000000003s)]
*  So to what extent are members of Congress, committee chairman, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2645.6800000000003s)]
*  leadership controlled by blackmail? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2648.88s)]
*  I really don't think there's much blackmail. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2653.92s)]
*  If there is, I'm not aware of it. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2657.84s)]
*  I have people come up to me. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2661.04s)]
*  I travel around the country, Texas and other states, and speak to groups, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2662.96s)]
*  food freedom groups, First Amendment, Second Amendment groups. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2669.6800000000003s)]
*  And they come to me and they say, why did my congressman sell out? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2674.7200000000003s)]
*  Bob was such a great guy. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2679.36s)]
*  And I campaigned for him. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2681.12s)]
*  I made phone calls. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2682.56s)]
*  I put up signs. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2683.44s)]
*  And then we sent Bob to Congress and he votes the wrong way every time. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2684.2400000000002s)]
*  Why is it? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2688.6400000000003s)]
*  Do they have his kids in a basement somewhere? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2690.0s)]
*  Do they have kiddie porn on him? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2692.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, what is it? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2694.32s)]
*  Why did Bob go bad? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2695.2000000000003s)]
*  And I have to look him in the eye and say, Bob just wanted to be liked. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2697.52s)]
*  There is a gene inside of congressmen. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2703.6800000000003s)]
*  If you look for a common denominator, they like people and they want to be liked, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2708.2400000000002s)]
*  for the most part. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2715.36s)]
*  And they're likable. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2717.52s)]
*  If they're not likable, it's hard to get elected. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2719.36s)]
*  Okay, so this self-selects for likable people, but likable people want to be liked. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2722.56s)]
*  And they're not surrounded by their wives and children who usually give them plenty of like. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2727.1200000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2731.28s)]
*  When they're in DC, it's like, who am I going to go to dinner with tonight? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2731.76s)]
*  I want to eat food with somebody that likes me. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2735.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2738.08s)]
*  So if you're not going to eat alone and you have to be liked, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2738.8s)]
*  and you generally have to be liked to get elected to Congress, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2741.84s)]
*  you better be liked. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2744.7200000000003s)]
*  And so it's literally, it's almost like kindergarten when somebody says, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2747.12s)]
*  I won't be your friend anymore if you don't give me your lunch. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2750.4s)]
*  Congressman fall for that. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2754.96s)]
*  They're in their 30s, 40s, 50s and they fall for that. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2756.56s)]
*  How do you have, it's interesting. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2759.28s)]
*  You like people. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2760.64s)]
*  I've asked around. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2762.32s)]
*  You don't seem to have any real enemies in the Congress. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2763.04s)]
*  I don't even think APAC hates you. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2765.68s)]
*  They just want you to obey, but it doesn't seem personal. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2767.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2770.72s)]
*  You don't seem to be a personal war with anybody. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2771.12s)]
*  That's my take on it. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2774.88s)]
*  I have a mutation. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2775.84s)]
*  So you like people. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2777.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2779.2s)]
*  Obviously you're not some weird autist who doesn't care about other people. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2779.68s)]
*  You like other people. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2782.72s)]
*  I love people. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2783.68s)]
*  I can tell. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2784.64s)]
*  And your colleagues say that, but you also don't feel like you need to fit in. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2785.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2792.0s)]
*  Same time. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2792.24s)]
*  What is that? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2792.8799999999997s)]
*  It's a mutation. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2793.7599999999998s)]
*  That chromosome, the liking people and likability chromosome usually has another gene on it right [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2794.8799999999997s)]
*  next to it, which is the need to be liked. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2802.08s)]
*  And I'm missing the need to be like gene. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2804.4799999999996s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2808.24s)]
*  I can go like on the cares act. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2810.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2812.3199999999997s)]
*  This was under President Trump, the 11th day to slow the spread of 15. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2813.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2818.4799999999996s)]
*  They said we're going to pass a $2.2 trillion package and you all just stay home. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2819.68s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2825.2s)]
*  We'll just do it by unanimous consent. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2827.2s)]
*  And it was 11 PM. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2829.52s)]
*  I'm sitting in my living room and they send us this message and I'm like WTF. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2830.9599999999996s)]
*  Like this is the space. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2836.3999999999996s)]
*  This is twice the size of the omnibus bill. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2837.4399999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2839.6s)]
*  This is going to cause massive inflation. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2840.0s)]
*  The policies in it are going to cause shortages. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2842.3199999999997s)]
*  And if we don't show up to vote, we're sending a message to all 50 states that you don't [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2844.56s)]
*  have to show up to vote in this election. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2848.56s)]
*  So it was like, I got my car and I drove eight hours. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2850.88s)]
*  I slept one hour in a rest stop because I knew I had to be there by 9 AM. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2855.2s)]
*  This was March 27th, 2020. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2859.12s)]
*  Actually, the 25th is the day I got to Congress to stop it. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2862.16s)]
*  And I got there and I said, it's not going by unanimous consent. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2865.92s)]
*  And I was literally sleeping in my wife's SUV, eating those peanut butter filled pretzels. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2869.44s)]
*  Like I had a big jug of those. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2875.28s)]
*  Those are good. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2876.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2876.96s)]
*  For my three days of nerd shit, I'm sitting in an SUV eating that big tub of pretzels [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2877.52s)]
*  with peanut butter in the middle. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2882.64s)]
*  Like waiting, just waiting for them to try to call it in session and sneak this bill [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2884.32s)]
*  passed. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2888.48s)]
*  And they're like, shit, Massey's going to do it. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2889.12s)]
*  So they loaded up congressmen. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2892.48s)]
*  You know, the airports were shut down for the most part. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2894.88s)]
*  There were some planes coming from California that only had two passengers and they were [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2897.36s)]
*  both congressmen. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2900.64s)]
*  So they roll them all back to Congress. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2901.84s)]
*  It takes them two days to assemble a quorum. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2904.8s)]
*  They went to the parliamentarian and they're like, is there any way around this? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2908.32s)]
*  He's like, nope, Massey's right. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2911.52s)]
*  The constitution requires a quorum. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2912.96s)]
*  If one, you know, he didn't call me an asshole, but if one asshole just shows up, objects [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2914.7200000000003s)]
*  and says there's no quorum here. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2920.08s)]
*  So they brought every back. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2921.6s)]
*  I go to the floor. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2923.04s)]
*  Actually got a, everybody was hating me. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2925.44s)]
*  I mean, everybody. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2927.92s)]
*  Did you know what it's like to be in a room of 434 people and they're all staring at you? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2930.08s)]
*  Like there, I had maybe 10 friends who were like looking at me like that guy is dead. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2935.04s)]
*  Like we've never seen Harry Carey like this. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2942.08s)]
*  They were worried for me, but the rest of them hated me. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2945.2s)]
*  They would come up to me and say, I live with my mother and when I go back home, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2948.56s)]
*  you're going to cause me to take COVID to her and she's going to die. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2953.68s)]
*  And I'm blaming you for this. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2956.88s)]
*  And I said, wait, yeah. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2959.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2961.12s)]
*  Well, like, no, it wasn't just one. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2961.7599999999998s)]
*  It was like when he was done, there was a line of people. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2963.68s)]
*  I was like, stood there and they're all coming to hate on me. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2966.24s)]
*  And I was like, but what about the guy that's going to the grocery store and bagging your [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2969.8399999999997s)]
*  groceries and carrying them out to the car? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2975.2s)]
*  Does he live with his mother too? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2976.96s)]
*  Like, what about the trucker who's out there driving and interacting with people in order [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2978.96s)]
*  to get the goods to where you need to be? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2983.9199999999996s)]
*  What about the nurse who's going to work every single day, taking care of people? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2985.68s)]
*  Is she going to kill her parents? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2990.16s)]
*  Like, why are you special? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2991.6s)]
*  They carved a hole in the side of a mountain in West Virginia for us in the case of emergency. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=2995.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3000.0s)]
*  Well, the sad but realistic thing is now they don't have a place for us. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3001.04s)]
*  We're so useless, right? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3004.96s)]
*  It's like, well, here's where we were going to keep them if shit hit the fan. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3006.64s)]
*  But now we've realized they're like useless. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3010.56s)]
*  We can declare war without them in the event of a nuclear strike. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3014.16s)]
*  So, you know, they're just a rounding error. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3017.2s)]
*  Three branches we can operate with two. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3020.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes, I've noticed. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3023.12s)]
*  So anyways, these are the kind of people who are supposed to respond in an emergency, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3024.3199999999997s)]
*  and they all wanted to stay home. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3027.6s)]
*  They all hated me for recognize our constitutional duty. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3028.72s)]
*  And Trump called me three times on the floor of the house while I was getting ready to [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3033.44s)]
*  make the motion to object. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3038.24s)]
*  And I let it go to voicemail three times in a row, which is probably not good. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3040.08s)]
*  But I couldn't leave the microphone because I was asking people, would you make this motion [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3044.08s)]
*  if I go to the restroom? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3048.96s)]
*  They're like, oh, no, no, no. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3050.0s)]
*  I mean, so I sat there. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3051.68s)]
*  I finally they yielded time for debate. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3055.52s)]
*  I go off the floor and called the White House switchboard back. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3057.7599999999998s)]
*  And and, you know, I didn't have his number. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3061.04s)]
*  I just like if you want to tour the White House, you call the number I called. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3063.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3067.2799999999997s)]
*  And the intern is like, oh, is this Congress of Massie? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3067.92s)]
*  I'm putting you through to Trump right now. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3070.56s)]
*  And so he comes off and goes, I'm coming at you like you've never seen never in your life before. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3072.48s)]
*  Have you seen the way in which I will come at you? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3078.96s)]
*  I'm more popular than you in Kentucky and you know it. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3081.52s)]
*  I'm back in your primary opponent and you're going to lose. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3084.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh crap, I probably will lose. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3090.0s)]
*  I mean, I had 95 percent popularity in among my Republican electorate who I had to face [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3093.52s)]
*  in about eight weeks. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3100.32s)]
*  In my primary. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3102.16s)]
*  And I had a well-funded opponent in here. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3103.52s)]
*  Now Trump was mad at me. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3105.52s)]
*  So he screamed at me for two or three minutes. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3108.0s)]
*  I kept trying to talk and he just screamed louder. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3110.3199999999997s)]
*  Then he repeated it all. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3112.8799999999997s)]
*  He goes, no, this is the second time you've done something like this. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3114.08s)]
*  And they took me out of it before, but not this time. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3118.48s)]
*  And then you're going to lose. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3121.8399999999997s)]
*  And he hangs up. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3124.0s)]
*  And like the thing is, like I had he said he thought it was the second time. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3125.04s)]
*  I'd done that like eight times since he was president. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3129.44s)]
*  He just started realizing it's the same guy. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3132.16s)]
*  The time before that was on war with Iran. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3136.32s)]
*  The Democrats were in the majority and he had just vaporized Soleimani. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3139.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3145.6s)]
*  And we were worried that he would attack mainland Iran without a vote of Congress. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3146.0s)]
*  So the Democrats actually insincerely, there aren't too many anti-war Democrats left. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3150.32s)]
*  I've noticed. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3154.64s)]
*  But they realized this was a chance to make a statement. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3155.44s)]
*  So they put a bill on the floor saying Trump, you can't go to war with Iran [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3158.96s)]
*  without a vote of Congress, which is constitutionally obvious. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3162.16s)]
*  So I had to vote for it, but I was only one of three Republicans to do it. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3165.2s)]
*  So he remembered that time, but he didn't remember the fake Obamacare [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3168.8s)]
*  repeal and some of the other things that I was kind of, you know, deterred in the punch bowl on. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3172.48s)]
*  Did it change your views at all? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3178.2400000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3181.52s)]
*  The president tweeted that I was a third rate grandstander and that [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3183.36s)]
*  this is before I got back to my seat. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3187.52s)]
*  I go back from the speaker's lobby to go to my seat to get ready to make the motion. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3190.8s)]
*  And one of the congress was like, you better look at your phone, Massey. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3194.96s)]
*  Look at your Twitter. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3198.2400000000002s)]
*  And I turned it on. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3199.0400000000004s)]
*  He's like tweeting hard and heavy against me. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3199.76s)]
*  He said I should be thrown out of the party. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3202.1600000000003s)]
*  Then the best one is I'm chairman of the Second Amendment Caucus. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3204.2400000000002s)]
*  So his third tweet was, he's terrible on guns. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3208.32s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3212.0s)]
*  Where did that come from? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3213.1200000000003s)]
*  Have you seen my Christmas card picture? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3214.7200000000003s)]
*  What's your Christmas card picture? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3217.76s)]
*  Oh, well, it's a little infamous. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3219.52s)]
*  No, I've actually seen it, but I just for the benefit of those who have not. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3222.0800000000004s)]
*  So, you know, I got my family together for Christmas and we got bluegrass instruments out. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3226.0800000000004s)]
*  We play music together and we took a Christmas card picture with bluegrass instruments. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3230.8s)]
*  And I said, hey, wouldn't it be kind of neat if we just like [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3235.44s)]
*  change these all out for machine guns and took a picture. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3238.5600000000004s)]
*  And that was supposed to stay on my phone for eternity. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3241.76s)]
*  But I had had a couple of medical margaritas one night. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3245.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't do medical marijuana, but I had a few medical margaritas. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3248.6400000000003s)]
*  And I looked at that picture and I thought, well, that's pretty good picture. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3252.48s)]
*  Be ashamed if nobody ever saw it. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3255.44s)]
*  And I tweeted it and I caught all kinds of hate for that. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3257.04s)]
*  The archbishop of Canterbury condemned it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3261.84s)]
*  This is the head of the Church of England condemned my tweet. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3266.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm like, oh my gosh. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3269.2000000000003s)]
*  Are you an Episcopalian? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3270.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm a Methodist. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3272.2400000000002s)]
*  Good. So you can ignore him. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3273.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, he's a disgrace. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3274.64s)]
*  So anyways, the press asked me as we're talking about the need to be liked, Gene, right? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3277.76s)]
*  If I had that, I would have been devastated that day. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3284.0s)]
*  If I had needed to be liked, I couldn't have carried that through. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3288.48s)]
*  And I walked out of that chamber. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3292.56s)]
*  Everybody's hate me in the chamber. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3295.12s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi called me a dangerous nuisance. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3296.7200000000003s)]
*  CNN called me the most hated person in DC. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3298.8s)]
*  John Kerry called me an asshole or something. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3301.8399999999997s)]
*  And President Trump called me a third rate grandstander. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3305.7599999999998s)]
*  This is all in the course of a few minutes, right? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3308.56s)]
*  I walk out of the chamber of the house and the reporters like swarm me, you know, like they do. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3310.7999999999997s)]
*  And I'm just trying to run back to the SUV with the pretzels with peanut butter in them [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3315.2799999999997s)]
*  and get out of there. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3320.24s)]
*  And the press said, what do you have to say for yourself? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3322.3199999999997s)]
*  Your own president just called you a third rate grandstander. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3327.52s)]
*  And I paused for a second and I said, I was offended. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3331.04s)]
*  I'm at least second rate. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3333.92s)]
*  What happened to your relationship with Trump? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3337.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, I think he respects people that stand up. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3341.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3343.7599999999998s)]
*  Disagrees with you. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3345.68s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3346.64s)]
*  And two years later, he did endorse me. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3347.36s)]
*  No way. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3350.32s)]
*  Yep. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3351.12s)]
*  Did you get along with him OK now? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3352.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3354.16s)]
*  I mean, I did endorse Ron DeSantis, not out of spite, but or animosity, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3355.04s)]
*  because we had already patched things up just because I served with Ron DeSantis for six years. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3360.4s)]
*  And he and I were really good friends. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3365.28s)]
*  We talked about bills when he was in Congress. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3366.8s)]
*  He and I fought over who was going to introduce the bill to eliminate congressional pensions. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3370.48s)]
*  And he won and I co-sponsored it. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3376.0s)]
*  Now I'm the sponsor now that he's a governor. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3377.6800000000003s)]
*  But I knew he was a good person and he thinks things through and he was smart. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3379.92s)]
*  So I endorsed him. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3383.04s)]
*  But, you know, because I have I call it natural immunity. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3385.36s)]
*  I have Trump antibodies at this point. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3388.32s)]
*  They may wear off at some point. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3390.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you think if you did run for, say, just pulling us out of a hat, but governor of [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3393.6s)]
*  Kentucky, do you think Trump would endorse you? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3398.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3401.76s)]
*  He'd probably do some polling and see who was winning. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3402.56s)]
*  Fair. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3406.1600000000003s)]
*  Fair. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3406.64s)]
*  Totally fair. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3406.96s)]
*  I wouldn't turn down an endorsement. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3408.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3410.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3410.88s)]
*  So it's not. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3411.6800000000003s)]
*  Are you at war with anybody in the Congress? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3412.88s)]
*  No. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3414.96s)]
*  I get along with everybody. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3415.6s)]
*  And people try to use this against me. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3418.4s)]
*  You know, when APAC was running those ads that say I always vote with AOC [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3420.56s)]
*  and Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, you know. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3426.0s)]
*  So I introduced an amendment and forced to vote on eliminating the kill switch in automobiles. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3429.44s)]
*  It's mandated. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3435.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3436.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3437.52s)]
*  Well, I was losing Republicans on that. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3438.0s)]
*  I lost like 20 Republicans. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3440.64s)]
*  So I knew I needed some. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3442.08s)]
*  Just to be clear for the people who don't know what you're talking about. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3443.28s)]
*  In new vehicles, this has been the case for years. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3446.2400000000002s)]
*  They can be turned off remotely by the authorities, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3449.2799999999997s)]
*  which is like the most North Korean thing ever to happen. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3452.32s)]
*  That's what you're talking about. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3455.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3456.64s)]
*  By 2026, every new automobile sold has to be able to turn itself off [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3456.7999999999997s)]
*  if it doesn't like your driving. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3462.96s)]
*  So I'm like, how do you appeal this conviction at the roadside? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3466.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3469.92s)]
*  Maybe you swerve to Missadir and pulled over for an ambulance [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3470.16s)]
*  and you got your kids in the car and it stops. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3473.04s)]
*  How could anyone vote for something that evil? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3474.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3476.64s)]
*  Because again, they know that I'm right, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3477.84s)]
*  but they're worried about, for instance, mothers against drunk driving. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3482.2400000000002s)]
*  Or they don't have the bravery. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3485.52s)]
*  Wait, worse, we just let in millions of illegal aliens [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3488.48s)]
*  who are allowed to drunk drive. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3490.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3492.7200000000003s)]
*  And Biden has told us that drunk driving is not a big deal. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3493.04s)]
*  It's not grounds for deporting. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3495.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3497.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3497.52s)]
*  So mothers against drunk driving, as far as I know, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3497.76s)]
*  said nothing about this. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3500.96s)]
*  Like who cares what they think? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3501.6800000000003s)]
*  I know. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3503.76s)]
*  But there may be, let's say, one constituent in your district [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3504.56s)]
*  who gets a hold of you and they lost a child to drunk driving, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3507.12s)]
*  which is terrible. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3509.52s)]
*  And they say, you don't care about me if you vote for Masty's amendment. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3510.7999999999997s)]
*  And they make that personal phone call. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3516.96s)]
*  That congressman doesn't have the fortitude to say, or knowledge, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3519.04s)]
*  to say, look, this technology can't work. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3523.04s)]
*  I really care about your child. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3525.92s)]
*  I think you're drunk driving is a scourge and I want to fix it. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3527.92s)]
*  But this is a false promise. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3531.44s)]
*  And it's only going to increase the price of automobiles [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3533.3599999999997s)]
*  and give the government more control. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3536.0s)]
*  So I'm going to vote with Masty. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3538.32s)]
*  They don't have the courage to say that. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3540.0s)]
*  So long story short, I lost 20 Republicans. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3542.4s)]
*  I needed some Democrats. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3546.08s)]
*  So I went over to AOC, who I get along with just fine. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3547.44s)]
*  Don't hate me for saying that. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3551.04s)]
*  I don't. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3552.4s)]
*  And I said, AOC, they're running ads right now that say you always vote, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3553.84s)]
*  or that I always vote with you. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3557.36s)]
*  Just once, could you vote with me? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3559.04s)]
*  Could you vote for my kill switch amendment [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3561.04s)]
*  since they're running ads the other way? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3563.2s)]
*  And she did. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3564.72s)]
*  She voted to defund the automobile kill switch. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3565.84s)]
*  For her. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3568.88s)]
*  So she ran. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3569.84s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3572.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, obviously, I don't like her, but I think she's talented. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3572.88s)]
*  She is definitely talented. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3577.52s)]
*  But she ran as a radical, as someone from the outside, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3579.2000000000003s)]
*  which I'm, of course, very sympathetic to. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3581.76s)]
*  But she doesn't seem to actually be that person. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3584.0800000000004s)]
*  So like, for example, on the foreign aid stuff, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3586.96s)]
*  how often does she vote with you? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3590.0800000000004s)]
*  Quite frequently, but I had a funny moment. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3592.72s)]
*  You know, this 15 or 16 votes we had on Israel in April. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3596.16s)]
*  Well, the squad and I, and I know this is going to be used in the next ad against me, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3600.48s)]
*  this clip from Tucker. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3605.52s)]
*  But I was the only no sometimes. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3607.2799999999997s)]
*  Sometimes most of the squad voted with me, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3609.84s)]
*  but I noticed AOC wasn't always there with me. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3612.96s)]
*  So I went over to the squad on the Democrat side of the aisle. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3615.7599999999998s)]
*  They literally sit together? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3618.48s)]
*  They hang out together. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3619.6s)]
*  Yeah, they kind of, it's really clique-ish. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3620.8s)]
*  Even, you know, the Freedom Caucus sits together. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3623.1200000000003s)]
*  The Texas delegation sits together. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3625.92s)]
*  There are different cliques. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3629.44s)]
*  The appropriators sit together. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3630.5600000000004s)]
*  It's the military guys, the intel guys sit together. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3633.04s)]
*  Sometimes it's by state, sometimes it's by clique. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3637.04s)]
*  A lot of the Congressional Black Caucus sits together. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3639.44s)]
*  I can't get the Second Amendment Caucus to sit together. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3643.2000000000003s)]
*  That's my caucus. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3645.6800000000003s)]
*  They're too independent minded. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3646.48s)]
*  Too independent. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3647.36s)]
*  But so I go over to their- [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3648.4s)]
*  But this is just high school cafeteria. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3649.6s)]
*  It's high school cafeteria. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3650.88s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3652.24s)]
*  And why would you, again, they need to be liked, right? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3653.2s)]
*  They don't want to sit next to people they don't like [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3655.68s)]
*  or who don't like them. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3657.6s)]
*  So I go over, I went over to the squad a few weeks ago [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3658.88s)]
*  and I said, I told AOC and for the squad, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3661.68s)]
*  I said, we're going to kick you out [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3664.24s)]
*  if you don't keep voting with this more consistently. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3665.52s)]
*  What did she say? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3668.4s)]
*  She laughed. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3669.2799999999997s)]
*  She thought it was funny. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3669.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, she has a sense of humor. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3670.64s)]
*  These people are humans. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3672.24s)]
*  There are 435, I call them goldfish in the aquarium. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3673.68s)]
*  You have to get 218 of them to pass a bill. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3677.68s)]
*  So it doesn't benefit me to hate on any of them. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3681.04s)]
*  Someday, you know, on some days they may vote with me. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3683.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, they're also people. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3686.56s)]
*  And if you can help it, you shouldn't hate people, period. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3687.68s)]
*  We've formed coalitions on the First Amendment, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3690.64s)]
*  on the Fourth Amendment, on war sometimes, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3693.44s)]
*  like to eliminate cluster bombs, delivering cluster bombs. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3696.64s)]
*  Even though the Democrats, almost to a person, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3699.6s)]
*  actually to a person, want to give Ukraine more aid, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3702.72s)]
*  some of them are like, well, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3705.3599999999997s)]
*  the cluster bombs, maybe we shouldn't do that. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3707.28s)]
*  OK? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3709.36s)]
*  And so you can form coalitions. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3710.0800000000004s)]
*  So I try to do that when I can. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3712.0s)]
*  But why aren't there anti-war Democrats? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3714.5600000000004s)]
*  Since it was the anti-war party for like 40 years. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3717.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3721.36s)]
*  And we've lost a lot of them on privacy and free speech as well. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3722.0800000000004s)]
*  I think with Russia, you asked this before, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3727.44s)]
*  there's this element that I didn't answer. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3730.6400000000003s)]
*  It's sort of a proxy against Trump for them now. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3732.96s)]
*  They, in their file folders, in their brain, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3736.16s)]
*  Trump and Russia are in the same file folder. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3739.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3742.24s)]
*  Even though that's a false narrative that's been dispelled long ago, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3742.7999999999997s)]
*  it's still in their same file folder. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3746.88s)]
*  So when they see Ukraine is fighting Russia, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3748.96s)]
*  they use that as a proxy for their hate for Trump. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3751.6s)]
*  And so they'll vote for that. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3755.04s)]
*  And they did. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3757.12s)]
*  They waved, I don't know if you saw this, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3757.7599999999998s)]
*  they were waving Ukrainian flags after Mike Johnson put the bill on the floor. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3759.68s)]
*  And every Democrat voted for it. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3764.08s)]
*  This was premeditated. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3765.7599999999998s)]
*  Somebody had to go buy 200 Ukrainian flags and hand them out. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3766.88s)]
*  And I filmed it, which you're not supposed to do, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3772.4s)]
*  but you're also not supposed to wave flags of other countries on the floor of the House. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3776.08s)]
*  So I'm like, all right, I'm going to expose this. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3780.08s)]
*  So I filmed it and I put it on Twitter to show what, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3783.44s)]
*  the humiliation that Mike Johnson brought upon us [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3787.04s)]
*  by bringing the Democrat bill to the floor [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3791.12s)]
*  and it was leveraged too, even if you're a Republican [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3794.16s)]
*  and you're okay with sending money to Ukraine, that's a leverage point. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3796.4s)]
*  Do something for our country and require that as a condition of doing whatever that is. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3800.48s)]
*  But he gave up all the leverage. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3805.36s)]
*  I put that video on Twitter. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3806.64s)]
*  Three days later, the sergeant at arms tracks down one of my staffers in Kentucky [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3808.48s)]
*  because we're no longer in session and says he needs to delete that video from Twitter [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3814.56s)]
*  or we're going to take a fine out of his salary, out of his congressional salary. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3819.84s)]
*  And so my staffer, he knew what I was going to do. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3824.7200000000003s)]
*  He told me what they had just said. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3827.6000000000004s)]
*  I said, all right, I'm retweeting it. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3829.36s)]
*  Did you? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3833.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3833.84s)]
*  And it got like 8 million views. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3834.56s)]
*  It went from 4 million to 8 million. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3835.92s)]
*  And then, you know, sometimes you just got to double down [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3838.1600000000003s)]
*  and the speaker had to announce on Twitter that I wouldn't be fined for that. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3841.6000000000004s)]
*  But no one was considering finding any member who waved the flag of a foreign nation on the floor of the House of Representatives. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3846.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3852.48s)]
*  And they were taking selfies of them with their foreign flags too. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3852.96s)]
*  And none of them got a phone call. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3856.7200000000003s)]
*  Only I got a phone call because I exposed the humiliation. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3858.6400000000003s)]
*  It wasn't just a humiliation of those of us in Congress. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3861.76s)]
*  It was a humiliation of our country. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3865.76s)]
*  I mean, it's one of the most corrupt countries in the world. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3868.96s)]
*  And they got everything they wanted for them. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3872.7200000000003s)]
*  And the Democrats are waving the flag, even though the Ukrainian flag, even though they're in the majority. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3877.04s)]
*  And we just have to like sit there and take that. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3881.28s)]
*  It was horrible. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3884.56s)]
*  Do you think any, I mean, the leader of Ukraine is not elected anymore. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3887.52s)]
*  His term has ended. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3892.4s)]
*  He's not having a new election. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3894.0800000000004s)]
*  He's the unelected maximum power. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3895.44s)]
*  In some places, we call that a dictator. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3898.4s)]
*  And yet they're still hitting us with a democracy, pro-democracy talking points. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3900.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you think, I mean, have they thought this through at all? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3905.12s)]
*  Are they just lying? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3908.16s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3908.96s)]
*  They're lying. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3911.52s)]
*  I mean, they know it. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3912.7200000000003s)]
*  And the good news is some Republicans are waking up to it. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3914.32s)]
*  Remember, when we started voting on these Ukraine resolutions, even, you know, as soon as the war started, I was the only no. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3917.28s)]
*  There was like this open-ended promise in a non-binding resolution that said, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3925.2000000000003s)]
*  give them whatever they need. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3929.6800000000003s)]
*  And there were only like two other Republicans that joined me on this. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3931.36s)]
*  But now we've got a majority of Republicans in Congress who are saying, wait, this is, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3935.2000000000003s)]
*  they aren't using this money like we thought they were. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3940.96s)]
*  And we're giving them money to fund pensions of retired politicians in Ukraine who were most certainly corrupt. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3945.44s)]
*  And we're paying their pensions with this money. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3953.84s)]
*  But most Republicans don't support it. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3955.6800000000003s)]
*  So that means that your speaker, the Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, is working for the Democrats. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3957.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's that simple. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3962.48s)]
*  I mean, and that's one of the reasons we went through with the motion to vacate. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3964.0s)]
*  Paul Gosar and I co-sponsored Marjorie's motion to vacate. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3968.56s)]
*  There were ultimately 11 of us who voted for it. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3972.16s)]
*  Motion vacate would be to fire him. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3974.56s)]
*  To fire Speaker Johnson, just like they had done Kevin McCarthy. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3975.92s)]
*  Although I thought inappropriately and at the wrong time and for the wrong reasons, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3981.2799999999997s)]
*  they did that to McCarthy. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3986.08s)]
*  But here we had Speaker Johnson, who is doing all the things people were afraid McCarthy might do. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3987.36s)]
*  They pre convicted McCarthy for things they thought he would do. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3993.7599999999998s)]
*  And here Mike Johnson came and did all these things. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3997.04s)]
*  He put an omnibus on the floor. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=3999.6s)]
*  He passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, re-upped that without warrants, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4001.04s)]
*  built the FBI a new building and gave Ukraine all this money. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4006.08s)]
*  So what happened, what Marjorie and I and Paul decided ultimately is we needed to expose the [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4009.52s)]
*  Uniparty. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4016.48s)]
*  And never before have you had Democrats vote for a Republican Speaker. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4017.76s)]
*  And that's why we forced the question. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4022.8s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi voted for him. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4024.96s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries went on national TV and said, why would we want to get rid of him? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4026.8s)]
*  He's given us everything we want. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4031.6s)]
*  I mean, the Uniparty has never been so exposed as it was when we called that motion to vacate. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4033.8399999999997s)]
*  I know some people got mad at us, said we shouldn't have done it. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4040.08s)]
*  But it's a long game, which we certainly hope that he doesn't become Speaker next January. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4043.2799999999997s)]
*  And hopefully people will have seen with Nancy Pelosi rushing to Speaker Johnson's aid that [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4049.44s)]
*  he's not the Speaker you want when Trump wins the White House and we keep the majority. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4055.04s)]
*  Do you think he will be? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4061.04s)]
*  A lot of this depends on what the people want and if they can see it. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4063.84s)]
*  Hopefully also Trump sees it that Mike Johnson would be even worse than Paul Ryan. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4067.52s)]
*  Paul Ryan, while he was still in the majority, Paul Ryan sent like a dozen CRs or omnibus bills [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4072.88s)]
*  to President Trump's desk because he didn't have any money for a wall in it. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4082.4s)]
*  Like he had no intention of ever funding a wall, Paul Ryan did. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4087.28s)]
*  And so I think Mike Johnson is going to be similarly the same way. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4092.48s)]
*  He's basically working for the Deep State at this point in the Uniparty. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4095.44s)]
*  How did that happen? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4099.04s)]
*  Do you have any idea? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4099.92s)]
*  The Paul Ryan bit or... [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4102.32s)]
*  No, well, Paul Ryan is a... [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4103.4400000000005s)]
*  Change. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4105.28s)]
*  Is a sinister person, I happen to know, but also just kind of not a genius and an ideologue [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4106.96s)]
*  at the same time, which is like a bad combination. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4112.72s)]
*  Dumb ideologues are the scariest. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4114.88s)]
*  But Mike Johnson seemed like kind of a moderately conservative, kind of sincere, decent guy. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4116.96s)]
*  Maybe he would babysit your kids and do an okay job. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4124.4800000000005s)]
*  Unlike Paul Ryan. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4128.16s)]
*  But he just... [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4129.52s)]
*  And then he immediately just becomes a tool of CIA and Jake Sullivan and the Biden administration. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4130.320000000001s)]
*  How did that happen so fast? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4136.8s)]
*  Well, one of the things he claims, which I don't believe is true, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4138.56s)]
*  and I have reason to say this, is that he says he went in a skiff. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4142.32s)]
*  Like he's had some 180 degree turns on some things, like for instance, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4147.2s)]
*  whether you need a warrant to spy on Americans using the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4151.44s)]
*  702 program. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4155.679999999999s)]
*  Well, he used to be on judiciary committee with me and Jim Jordan, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4157.12s)]
*  trying to reform that, trying to get... [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4161.2s)]
*  So he understood what it was. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4162.88s)]
*  He knew completely what we were talking about. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4164.24s)]
*  He's an attorney too, right? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4166.08s)]
*  And he knows the Constitution. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4167.759999999999s)]
*  He knows this is required. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4169.5199999999995s)]
*  But he claims he spent time in a skiff and he learned things. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4170.64s)]
*  Skiff, that's a secure compartmentalized information facility or something. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4174.320000000001s)]
*  It's where we go. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4179.84s)]
*  We have to leave our phones locked up, no staff in there. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4180.56s)]
*  He claims he spent time in skiff and learned things that changed his mind. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4184.0s)]
*  Here's the problem, Tucker. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4187.92s)]
*  I was in skiff with him. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4189.12s)]
*  We had DNI, not just the current DNI, but the former DNI, John Radcliffe, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4193.76s)]
*  Trump's DNI. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4199.76s)]
*  We had CIA. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4201.04s)]
*  We had FBI. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4202.8s)]
*  We even had a FISA judge in there and we spent three and a half hours. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4204.8s)]
*  It was a four hour meeting and after three and a half hours, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4208.96s)]
*  it was basically a PsyOP where they were just trying to beat you down and do the things. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4212.16s)]
*  And I was like, this is ridiculous. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4217.6s)]
*  They didn't give us one example of any time ever since FISA was created [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4221.04s)]
*  that getting a warrant would have kept them from solving or preventing an act of terrorism. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4226.48s)]
*  They gave hypotheticals, but they had no specific. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4231.679999999999s)]
*  I think FISA has been in place since 1978, since the 70s. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4234.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4238.08s)]
*  So almost 50 years and they couldn't give you one example? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4238.719999999999s)]
*  Not one example. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4241.599999999999s)]
*  Now, they also expanded it after 9-11 to do the program to go against civilians, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4242.48s)]
*  to spy on civilians. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4251.04s)]
*  And actually that product came out of the Judiciary Committee. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4252.96s)]
*  Here's another place where the speaker betrayed us. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4256.48s)]
*  FISA 702 was created by John Conyers and Jim Sensenbrenner. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4261.12s)]
*  Conyers was the chairman and Sensenbrenner was the ranking member. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4265.679999999999s)]
*  And what Mike Johnson said this year was, well, even though the Judiciary Committee [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4270.4s)]
*  created this and is responsible for overseeing it, I'm going to let the Intel Committee bring [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4276.0s)]
*  the bill to the floor without warrants in it. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4281.12s)]
*  It wasn't even their jurisdiction. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4283.84s)]
*  They have jurisdiction over FISA as long as it's for the CIA, but not for the FBI. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4285.76s)]
*  So that was frustrating. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4293.599999999999s)]
*  It's shocking. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4296.48s)]
*  It's shocking. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4297.28s)]
*  It is shocking. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4298.0s)]
*  So he said, you know. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4298.64s)]
*  Like end of civil liberties level stuff. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4299.599999999999s)]
*  So yes. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4301.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4303.12s)]
*  But it's not like he learned new information in the skiff. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4304.4s)]
*  No, he did not. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4307.5199999999995s)]
*  I was there. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4308.48s)]
*  So what? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4309.12s)]
*  So that's a lie. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4310.64s)]
*  That's the problem, right? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4311.2s)]
*  The problem, the fact that I was there. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4312.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4314.5599999999995s)]
*  So that's a lie. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4314.96s)]
*  Telling people on your show that I was there for three and a half hours. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4315.5199999999995s)]
*  And Mike Johnson, go ask Mike Johnson. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4319.68s)]
*  He'll say, yep, he was there three and a half hours. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4321.2s)]
*  So what is the truth? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4324.24s)]
*  What do you think changed? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4325.2s)]
*  I think he's kind of a lost ball in tall weeds. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4330.08s)]
*  I think he's in a position of power he never imagined he would get to at this point in his life. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4333.2s)]
*  He's not done anything in private practice or political arena that's prepared him for this. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4338.88s)]
*  He took the job with a very small staff. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4344.96s)]
*  He didn't have people to put in all positions on the field. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4347.84s)]
*  And he had to accept a lot of suggestions in areas he didn't know a whole lot about. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4352.88s)]
*  Although he gets no pass on FISA. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4359.12s)]
*  He gets no pass on Ukraine. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4362.24s)]
*  Because he does, as you pointed out, he doesn't even know how many [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4364.56s)]
*  casualties have been incurred on the Ukrainian side. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4367.44s)]
*  I mean, he's the second person in line for president after Kamala Harris. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4371.36s)]
*  This is scary to me. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4376.5599999999995s)]
*  He's basically getting moved around. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4379.28s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4383.28s)]
*  You said nothing he did in his life before this prepared him for it. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4384.0s)]
*  But that itself may be kind of a more charitable explanation because- [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4389.839999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to be charitable. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4395.839999999999s)]
*  I've got to go back to work with him next week. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4397.6s)]
*  Nothing in your life prepared you for this. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4398.88s)]
*  For those who don't know, you went to MIT. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4401.28s)]
*  Your high school girlfriend joined you at MIT. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4404.4s)]
*  You married her while she was still there. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4406.24s)]
*  And then together you started a company based on a very sophisticated invention that you came up with. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4409.5199999999995s)]
*  Maybe the first of about 30 patents that you now have. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4416.88s)]
*  You ran this company for a long time. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4419.2s)]
*  Then you moved back to Kentucky. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4421.04s)]
*  And a lot of things happened and you went up running for Congress. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4422.96s)]
*  That's not the background. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4426.799999999999s)]
*  Well, so nothing in the political arena. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4428.639999999999s)]
*  But in my private life, I raised $32 million of venture capital and I swam with the sharks. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4431.44s)]
*  I had lots of moral dilemmas in the course of creating that company. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4439.2s)]
*  I could have taken money off the table and gone and done other things. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4442.879999999999s)]
*  But instead, I felt a commitment to my staff and to other investors. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4446.5599999999995s)]
*  I had investors who said, if you'll just shit can that guy you hired as president, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4450.799999999999s)]
*  we'll double our investment. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4456.48s)]
*  And I'm like, no, he's my partner. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4458.4s)]
*  He helped me get to this point. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4461.36s)]
*  I'm not going to abandon him. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4462.799999999999s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4464.0s)]
*  And so I had experiences in life. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4464.799999999999s)]
*  And then also just put my hands in the dirt on my farm. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4469.2s)]
*  So tell me about that. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4472.719999999999s)]
*  Tell us about how you live and where you live. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4474.5599999999995s)]
*  Because I think it's one of the most unusual things about you. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4476.959999999999s)]
*  So I spent, I grew up as a hillbilly in Eastern Kentucky. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4480.16s)]
*  What county? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4484.879999999999s)]
*  Lewis County. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4485.76s)]
*  Lewis County. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4486.4800000000005s)]
*  How many people in your town? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4487.12s)]
*  13,000 people, 13,000 cattle. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4488.08s)]
*  It's a huge landmass. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4490.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's a great county. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4493.52s)]
*  It's one of the 21 counties that I represent. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4496.4800000000005s)]
*  It's actually the poorest county per capita income that I represent. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4500.0s)]
*  But it's the one I grew up in. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4503.84s)]
*  So it's very unlikely that the congressman for the district [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4505.04s)]
*  would come from the poorest county. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4507.84s)]
*  So I grew up as a little nerd. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4509.92s)]
*  I love taking stuff apart because I was bored. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4512.320000000001s)]
*  There were no malls. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4514.8s)]
*  You couldn't ride your bicycle to any store. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4515.68s)]
*  And if you did, you didn't have any money. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4520.16s)]
*  So I had to find things to do at home. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4522.24s)]
*  I took apart things, built things, entered science fairs, built robots, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4524.24s)]
*  made it to the International Science Fair as a little hillbilly. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4528.16s)]
*  Won an award from NASA there. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4533.76s)]
*  And at the age of 15, I won the high school level awards. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4536.0s)]
*  And got into MIT, never visited the campus, didn't really have the money to go visit it. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4541.599999999999s)]
*  But I read about it. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4550.0s)]
*  There was no internet. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4551.12s)]
*  Seemed like a good place. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4552.4s)]
*  I got there. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4554.08s)]
*  I'd lived in a town of 1900 people all my life. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4555.36s)]
*  And I was there for six hours in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4558.96s)]
*  I crossed Massachusetts Avenue. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4562.08s)]
*  They had a crosswalk and a stoplight. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4564.5599999999995s)]
*  I'd never really seen two of those things together. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4566.72s)]
*  I'd seen crosswalks and stoplights. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4569.68s)]
*  So I walked through the crosswalk and a car honked, like that short little Boston. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4572.320000000001s)]
*  And I thought, oh my gosh, I've been here six hours and already run into somebody from Kentucky. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4578.240000000001s)]
*  And I turned around and waved at the car as big as I could. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4583.4400000000005s)]
*  Was it people from Kentucky? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4587.360000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4588.72s)]
*  I think they had one finger up and wave it back. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4589.6s)]
*  And people were like, that's not a true story. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4595.4400000000005s)]
*  Not only is it true, it took me a month to quit waving at cars that beeped. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4597.84s)]
*  It was just 18 years of conditioning. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4603.2s)]
*  You thought beeping was, hey. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4606.5599999999995s)]
*  Hey there. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4608.24s)]
*  That's what we thought that little thing in the middle of your steering wheel was for. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4609.2s)]
*  If you saw somebody and they couldn't see you through the windshield, just toot the horn. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4612.24s)]
*  Then you'd throw your hand up and wave. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4615.92s)]
*  They roll down the window. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4617.679999999999s)]
*  That's Bob. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4618.88s)]
*  And if you didn't wave, I mean, you were pariah. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4620.88s)]
*  You were probably an axe murderer who was in our town, right? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4623.679999999999s)]
*  Or you were just an a-hole. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4627.28s)]
*  So I didn't want to be either. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4630.24s)]
*  So I waved at that car in Massachusetts and kept waving for about a month. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4631.2s)]
*  But anyways, long story short, as you said, I invented a virtual reality device that lets [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4636.0s)]
*  you touch three-dimensional objects, started a company, raised venture capital, did that [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4640.8s)]
*  for 10 years, moved to the live free or die state. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4644.88s)]
*  New Hampshire. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4648.08s)]
*  New Hampshire. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4648.639999999999s)]
*  My company was in Massachusetts. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4649.28s)]
*  I couldn't move the center of gravity too far out of Cambridge. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4650.88s)]
*  Up to 128 on Woburn. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4654.56s)]
*  And then I commuted 40 miles every day so I could live in a state that lets you have [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4656.4s)]
*  machine guns and old cars and cool stuff. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4660.56s)]
*  Redneck sports. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4664.08s)]
*  The best. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4666.16s)]
*  The best sports. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4667.04s)]
*  Why did you move back to Kentucky? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4669.04s)]
*  After 10 years of doing it, we had three kids and we wanted to raise them like we were raised [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4671.12s)]
*  in Kentucky. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4680.64s)]
*  And we wanted to be near their grandparents. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4682.08s)]
*  Both my parents were still alive. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4684.4s)]
*  Both my wife's parents were still alive. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4685.68s)]
*  And you learn so much from your grandparents because your parents are really busy just [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4687.28s)]
*  trying to earn a living or whatever. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4691.84s)]
*  And if you're lucky enough to have a relationship with your grandparents, that's where I think [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4693.2s)]
*  the generational stuff carries on. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4697.68s)]
*  And I had a great relationship with my grandparents. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4700.4s)]
*  So we wanted our kids to live in that environment. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4703.12s)]
*  And we came back. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4705.6s)]
*  We bought the farm that my wife grew up on. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4706.5599999999995s)]
*  We built a house off the grid. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4709.5199999999995s)]
*  It runs on a Rekt Model S Tesla battery. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4711.52s)]
*  It's been running continuously for six and a half years. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4713.76s)]
*  So you built the house. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4715.84s)]
*  Who built the house? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4717.2s)]
*  I did. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4718.56s)]
*  Like we had an ice storm and a lot of trees fell down. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4719.2s)]
*  How big is the property? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4723.36s)]
*  It's 1,500 acres. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4724.88s)]
*  And it's wooded. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4728.32s)]
*  It's almost all woods. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4729.76s)]
*  Like, and it's too steep. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4731.6s)]
*  I don't want you to think this is like valuable Iowa. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4732.8s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4735.2s)]
*  I know the part of the state you're in. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4735.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4736.8s)]
*  Pack your lunch if you're on the ridge and you fall off the ridge because you're going [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4737.2s)]
*  to be hungry by the time you get to the bottom. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4740.32s)]
*  You're going to be grabbing like tree roots and stuff to keep from sliding. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4742.08s)]
*  But it grows trees and some of it is flat and you know, in the bottom. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4745.5199999999995s)]
*  But this is not plantation land. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4749.2s)]
*  No, these are hollers. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4750.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4752.0s)]
*  So in fact, interestingly enough, it's been a Republican county since the Civil War, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4752.639999999999s)]
*  even though all the counties around it have been Democrats since the Civil War. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4758.5599999999995s)]
*  Because the geography. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4762.0s)]
*  Because the geography. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4762.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4763.92s)]
*  The topography did not allow for consolidation of farms. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4764.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4768.0s)]
*  So there was no scale at which slavery made sense. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4768.32s)]
*  You could basically in your holler, you only had enough land that your family, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4771.44s)]
*  if you had enough kids, could farm. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4775.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4778.0s)]
*  And so that's the way people grew up. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4778.5599999999995s)]
*  And by the way, it's kind of libertarian. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4780.719999999999s)]
*  You know, I'll do my thing in my holler. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4782.639999999999s)]
*  You do your thing in your holler. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4785.44s)]
*  That's right. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4786.88s)]
*  If you need some help, let me know. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4787.28s)]
*  I'll come over and help you. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4788.719999999999s)]
*  Southwest Virginia is like this. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4789.599999999999s)]
*  West Virginia is like this. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4790.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4791.76s)]
*  Because the topography. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4792.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4793.2s)]
*  It's the reason West Virginia was Republican and seceded from Virginia. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4793.44s)]
*  So, by the way, half my family's from West Virginia and half my family's from Kentucky. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4799.5199999999995s)]
*  My mamawls, who's 97 right now, is still alive. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4803.92s)]
*  Her grandfather was Union soldier. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4808.4s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4811.2s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4812.0s)]
*  From West Virginia. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4813.759999999999s)]
*  From West Virginia, yeah. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4814.639999999999s)]
*  She still lives in West Virginia. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4815.92s)]
*  But like, we're not that far away from the Civil War. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4817.92s)]
*  No, I know. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4820.96s)]
*  I know. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4821.679999999999s)]
*  You can talk to people who were alive when people who fought in the Civil War. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4822.5599999999995s)]
*  I worked with a guy when I was at the newspaper in Arkansas. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4827.12s)]
*  The guy shared a desk with Bob Salee from Texarkana, Arkansas. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4829.44s)]
*  He said, I knew Confederate veterans. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4834.8s)]
*  That's in my lifetime. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4837.04s)]
*  I knew a man who knew Confederate veterans or Civil War veterans. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4838.0s)]
*  That's just absolutely crazy. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4840.72s)]
*  But my whole point of that was she's a Republican. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4841.76s)]
*  She's been a Republican, my mamawl, since the Civil War. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4844.32s)]
*  And like, nobody marries into our family if you're a Democrat. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4847.6s)]
*  You got to go see mamawl and she'll either approve or disapprove. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4851.28s)]
*  And she's had pretty good luck at sniffing out the Democrats. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4855.2s)]
*  Yeah, the liberals. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4859.84s)]
*  So you had an ice storm. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4861.12s)]
*  There was an ice storm on your property. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4862.08s)]
*  How does that figure into your house? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4863.44s)]
*  So I already had a bulldozer. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4864.5599999999995s)]
*  So I got a winch so I could drag these trees out. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4865.679999999999s)]
*  I got a sawmill, cut these into timbers, built a timber frame house. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4868.24s)]
*  What kind of wood? [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4872.24s)]
*  It's 17 kinds of wood because whatever fell down in the ice storm. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4873.28s)]
*  We've got oak, yellow poplar, hickory, beech. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4877.68s)]
*  So hardwood. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4881.52s)]
*  Hardwood, yep. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4882.320000000001s)]
*  And then we wanted to be self-sustaining. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4883.68s)]
*  How did she know how to timber frame? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4887.92s)]
*  I found a class on eBay for $500 in Tennessee and I bought it now. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4890.240000000001s)]
*  And I drove to Tennessee and took a one-week class and we built a little shed, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4895.360000000001s)]
*  slash cabin. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4900.0s)]
*  And I called my wife from a payphone and I said, I want to do this. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4901.12s)]
*  Like instead of going to get a job, we had just ended, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4905.200000000001s)]
*  like left our company after 10 years of working there and we'd moved back to Kentucky. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4908.64s)]
*  And I said, well, just build a timber frame house. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4913.120000000001s)]
*  Like full-time? [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4915.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4916.8s)]
*  Woke up every morning, had my coffee and started chiseling away or [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4917.52s)]
*  going up in the woods and dragging more trees out that had fallen down. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4922.400000000001s)]
*  So you built your house full-time like as a job every day? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4925.68s)]
*  And this is what our kids saw too. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4929.84s)]
*  The flooring for our kitchen came out of the creek. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4932.4s)]
*  We call it a crick. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4934.72s)]
*  What do you mean the flooring came out of the creek? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4936.5599999999995s)]
*  There are rocks in the creek that are flat that they look like the stuff you buy at Lowe's that's [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4939.12s)]
*  fake and like, oh, this is what they modeled the fake stuff after. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4945.68s)]
*  It's free. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4950.16s)]
*  Let's just go pick it up. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4950.72s)]
*  Now, we probably have, we're paying ourselves about $3 an hour compared to if we had just [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4952.16s)]
*  gone to one of the box stores and bought it in terms of harvesting it. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4957.28s)]
*  But our kids, I think in addition to being with their grandparents, learned a big lesson [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4961.76s)]
*  that, wow, mom and dad are growing our food. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4966.64s)]
*  They are collecting the materials for the house here from the environment [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4970.0s)]
*  that you don't have to rely, you know, neighbors are good though, right? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4976.56s)]
*  We actually sent them to public school, which was, and we let them ride the bus. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4980.400000000001s)]
*  It was only three miles away, but we figured the bus ride was important too, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4985.52s)]
*  because when you get to school, they sort of separate you. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4989.12s)]
*  But you've got, can be 15 terrifying minutes on the bus where you interact with everybody, right? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4991.92s)]
*  I remember my son, he was like 10 years old. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=4999.599999999999s)]
*  He traded some Yu-Gi-Oh cards on the bus and for this like awesome, the best Yu-Gi-Oh card ever. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5002.8s)]
*  And he showed it to us and it was a little plastic thing. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5010.48s)]
*  And we're like, well, did you want to take it out of plastic? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5012.88s)]
*  No, no, he told me to leave it in here. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5015.2s)]
*  And we take it out and it was a fake. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5017.2s)]
*  And he was so mad, but it turns out his dad had sold me a leaky bulldozer [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5019.92s)]
*  and said there was no leaks in it. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5024.88s)]
*  It ran in the family. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5027.76s)]
*  It ran in the family. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5028.88s)]
*  The same kid who stiffed my son, it stiffed me on this dozer. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5030.0s)]
*  But you learn these, these are life lessons, right? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5035.12s)]
*  They didn't lead a sheltered life. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5037.28s)]
*  And so we grew up, you know, they grew up there. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5039.36s)]
*  What percent of the timbers in the timber frame came from your property? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5043.12s)]
*  All of it. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5047.36s)]
*  In fact, they never left the farm. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5048.08s)]
*  Really? [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5050.400000000001s)]
*  So you milled it there? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5051.2s)]
*  Milled it there, chiseled it there, made the mortise and tenons and the dovetails. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5052.32s)]
*  It was a lot of work. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5057.12s)]
*  Personally. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5057.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5058.8s)]
*  How did you, you know, cutting a mortise and tenon, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5059.6s)]
*  cutting a dovetail joint, these are, having done it, very difficult. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5062.96s)]
*  How did you learn to do that? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5067.84s)]
*  I kept telling myself, look, farmers without calculators pulled this off 200 years ago. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5069.360000000001s)]
*  And so surely if I've got a computer and some, you know, electricity, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5074.88s)]
*  I should be able to do this as well. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5080.0s)]
*  Just dent of will. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5083.76s)]
*  But she'd been like an electrical engineer, software programmer. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5085.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5091.599999999999s)]
*  But not a... [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5092.4s)]
*  Nothing that scale. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5093.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5095.12s)]
*  I mean, the only thing I built before that was a tree house, right? [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5096.16s)]
*  And even that didn't get finished. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5100.16s)]
*  So, but I mean, some of that stuff is very complex, like actually complex. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5102.72s)]
*  Timber framing, some of the joints are difficult to cut and the design itself is complicated. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5107.76s)]
*  Yeah. You don't like, you have to plan it all ahead. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5115.599999999999s)]
*  You don't like hold the timber up there like you would a two by four. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5119.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5121.76s)]
*  Oh, we need to solve two more inches. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5122.26s)]
*  It's not balloon framing. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5123.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5124.5599999999995s)]
*  Totally right. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5124.88s)]
*  Or, oh, that 45 needs to be a 42 degree angle. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5125.68s)]
*  Let's, you know, saw off a little bit more. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5128.96s)]
*  You can't do that while it's, you know, you're up in the middle of the air on scaffolding, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5130.8s)]
*  trying to get two pieces to fit together. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5134.64s)]
*  It's actually, it's a fun math problem. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5136.72s)]
*  So I enjoyed it. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5138.72s)]
*  But is there something honest about it? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5139.68s)]
*  Because all the fasteners are wooden too. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5141.6s)]
*  So it's one medium that you learn. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5143.92s)]
*  There's no like bolts. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5146.320000000001s)]
*  So it's all pegs. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5147.52s)]
*  Nails, all pegs. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5148.24s)]
*  And once you realize that... [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5149.68s)]
*  So there are no metal fasteners in the frame? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5151.84s)]
*  Correct. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5153.92s)]
*  None. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5154.72s)]
*  I mean, we had to nail the floor to the frame. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5155.84s)]
*  I got it. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5158.0s)]
*  And the walls on it. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5158.8s)]
*  Of course. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5159.4400000000005s)]
*  But the frame itself... [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5160.0s)]
*  The frame that... [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5160.96s)]
*  No metal fasteners. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5161.68s)]
*  And it's 46 feet tall. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5162.8s)]
*  It's 46 feet tall? [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5164.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5166.0s)]
*  From the basement slab, which I timber framed the basement too. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5166.8s)]
*  I still don't even know how to stick frame. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5170.16s)]
*  Like, I'm like, well, I'm going to build one house. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5172.72s)]
*  I'm going to learn one technology. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5175.52s)]
*  Which is the framing that your house is if you're watching this. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5176.48s)]
*  It's stick frame. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5178.96s)]
*  It's stick frame. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5179.68s)]
*  So I was like, well, let's build the basement timber frame too. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5180.64s)]
*  And the dormers, like if you paid a company to build timber frame, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5183.84s)]
*  they would stick frame the dormers. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5186.64s)]
*  Well, of course. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5188.24s)]
*  Or buy them and just bolt them on. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5189.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5190.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5191.12s)]
*  I timber framed that. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5192.32s)]
*  I'm just like, let's just be pure the whole way. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5193.5199999999995s)]
*  And there's... [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5195.92s)]
*  As an engineer, I thought, well, I want to build a house with timbers. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5197.44s)]
*  I like how timbers look. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5201.28s)]
*  Me too. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5202.32s)]
*  But, you know, we'll just bolt them together. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5203.12s)]
*  We'll use iron brackets. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5205.5199999999995s)]
*  That's the best way to do it. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5206.8s)]
*  But in the course of this one week class, I came to realize, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5208.32s)]
*  wow, if you just let go and make everything out of wood, it solves problems [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5212.0s)]
*  that you would create when you start using metal fasteners. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5216.88s)]
*  Like wood shrinks. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5219.68s)]
*  It takes like six or eight years for a big timber to fully dry out. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5221.84s)]
*  So how do you deal with metal fasteners and shrinking wood? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5226.56s)]
*  Well, the metal fasteners can rip out. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5229.92s)]
*  But if you build your fasteners out of wood, like it can all work. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5231.76s)]
*  It moves together. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5235.68s)]
*  And there's, you know, if you go to Germany, there's homes that are [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5236.56s)]
*  four or five hundred years old to show that it can work. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5240.72s)]
*  So all the timbers came from the property. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5244.64s)]
*  What about the stone? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5246.72s)]
*  There's a lot of stone in the house. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5247.52s)]
*  Yep. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5248.72s)]
*  We got some of it out of the creek. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5249.04s)]
*  We dug some of it out of the ground. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5250.96s)]
*  All of the stone is from the property. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5252.56s)]
*  How did you dig it out of the ground? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5254.4800000000005s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5255.68s)]
*  You started a stone quarry on your own property? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5256.240000000001s)]
*  In my front yard. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5258.88s)]
*  It's now a pond. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5259.68s)]
*  But there was an old logging road and the erosion had exposed this layer of rock. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5261.84s)]
*  And I thought, well, that layer of rock must go pretty far. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5267.68s)]
*  So I started digging using a backhoe. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5271.84s)]
*  I started digging the dirt off of that layer of rock. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5274.0s)]
*  And I'm like, wow, there are lots of rocks here. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5276.88s)]
*  And I just I almost giggled out loud when I shoved on that layer of rock with my backhoe. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5279.5199999999995s)]
*  And all these rocks started rolling out in front of the blade. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5285.44s)]
*  And they looked like rocks you could buy at the store. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5288.24s)]
*  You know, like, well, why would I go buy them? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5291.36s)]
*  Like, I can just like shove three tons of them out of here in, you know, a few minutes. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5293.92s)]
*  And then I had people coming and visiting. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5301.2s)]
*  Obviously, it looked like a bunch of weirdos building this timber frame house up on the hill. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5303.12s)]
*  And people would come up and they were you living at this point? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5308.88s)]
*  We lived in a mobile home. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5311.599999999999s)]
*  Like, we just pulled in a mobile home and I told my wife we don't live in it for six months. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5313.04s)]
*  We end up two years in a 900 square foot mobile home with four kids. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5318.32s)]
*  No way. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5322.88s)]
*  It's but I mean, it's actually not that bad. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5324.0s)]
*  You get to know your family really well. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5327.12s)]
*  You can hear it's like being on a boat. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5329.6s)]
*  Yeah, you try to go to the bathroom. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5331.4400000000005s)]
*  And if you're gone for more than five minutes, like the wall between the kitchen and the bathroom is so thin. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5333.200000000001s)]
*  You're just enjoying private moment there on the throne. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5338.080000000001s)]
*  Trying to read a magazine about timber framing or something. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5342.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5345.6s)]
*  And you can hear the kids at the dinner table saying, where daddy go? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5346.240000000001s)]
*  Where daddy? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5349.6s)]
*  Where's daddy? [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5350.320000000001s)]
*  And then start trying to find daddy. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5351.200000000001s)]
*  Anyways, it was a good comfy experience. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5354.8s)]
*  And now we actually kept the mobile home and we lease it to deer hunters. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5357.52s)]
*  Really? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5362.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5362.88s)]
*  It's a double wide. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5363.52s)]
*  So it's full of deer heads and bunk beds now. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5364.96s)]
*  And the hunters call it the lodge, which we find amusing. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5367.4400000000005s)]
*  My wife calls it the double lodge since it's a double wide. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5371.040000000001s)]
*  Do you have a lot of deer on your land? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5374.160000000001s)]
*  We have trophy deer all over. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5375.92s)]
*  What do you charge to rent it just in case people are interested? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5379.120000000001s)]
*  We're booked up. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5383.4400000000005s)]
*  You don't have any weird internet people on your land. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5384.16s)]
*  We are booked up. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5388.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5389.68s)]
*  So how long did it take you to finish this house? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5390.32s)]
*  It's not finished. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5393.36s)]
*  I've been criticized. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5394.8s)]
*  In campaigns, people try to use this against me. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5396.72s)]
*  Some guy goes, he doesn't even have doors on all these rooms. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5399.2s)]
*  He's some kind of weirdo. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5402.0s)]
*  Well, we haven't made that door yet, right? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5405.68s)]
*  You're making the doors? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5407.92s)]
*  We have made a few of them. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5409.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5410.96s)]
*  We're kind of breaking down now and buying a few doors. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5411.599999999999s)]
*  Now that the kids are gone. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5415.04s)]
*  That was like your kids. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5418.08s)]
*  How long has this process been? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5420.639999999999s)]
*  We started in 2003. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5422.24s)]
*  21 years? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5425.12s)]
*  21 years. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5425.76s)]
*  And we've been off the grid that long too. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5426.32s)]
*  Again. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5428.48s)]
*  When you say off the grid, what do you mean? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5429.04s)]
*  We're not connected to any public utility. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5431.5199999999995s)]
*  Not electricity, not water, not sewer, not phone. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5434.0s)]
*  The house is totally disconnected from everything. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5439.12s)]
*  Did you build those systems yourself? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5442.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5444.639999999999s)]
*  A lot of it's off the shelf stuff, but some of it's improvised. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5445.84s)]
*  Field expedient. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5449.5199999999995s)]
*  Like the Tesla battery, the car battery that runs the house. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5451.599999999999s)]
*  You can't buy that out of a catalog. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5454.16s)]
*  You go to a junkyard and say, how much do you want for that wrecked Model S? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5456.0s)]
*  And like, I'll sell you the battery for 15,000. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5460.72s)]
*  Why can't you just buy the battery separately? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5463.76s)]
*  They won't. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5466.72s)]
*  Tesla wouldn't sell me a Powerwall. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5468.0s)]
*  I tried to buy one for years. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5470.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5471.92s)]
*  Because it has to be connected to the grid for some reason. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5472.56s)]
*  Their business model involves that. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5475.28s)]
*  So I was like, all right, well, I'll get a battery. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5477.84s)]
*  How much different can it be from the batteries in their car? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5481.12s)]
*  So I drove to Lake Lanier, Georgia with a little trailer, landscaping trailer. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5484.16s)]
*  The battery weighs, I think 1200 pounds. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5489.36s)]
*  But here's the funny thing. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5493.52s)]
*  It's considered hazardous material if you pull it on a trailer. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5494.88s)]
*  But if it's in a car, it's just fine. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5499.68s)]
*  So I hurried up and got back to Kentucky with the trailer. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5502.56s)]
*  I don't have a hazmat life. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5506.64s)]
*  So it was a wrecked Tesla Model S and you pulled the battery out of it. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5507.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5512.4s)]
*  And what did you do with it? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5512.64s)]
*  Disassembled it. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5513.92s)]
*  I paid $15,000 cash, but this is like, you know, I'm I this probably like 15 or 20 years. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5515.2s)]
*  Hopefully it'll last. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5521.04s)]
*  And so I brought it home, took it apart. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5522.96s)]
*  Actually, I made a YouTube video of this. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5526.16s)]
*  And what's kind of funny is I had these big rubber gloves that a friend who had worked on [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5528.24s)]
*  power lines, you know, they were leftovers and he gave to me. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5532.08s)]
*  And so like in the YouTube video, I try to make sure like I'm using big rubber gloves and stuff. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5534.96s)]
*  And I did like this fast forward, you know, of the disassembly of the battery. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5540.4s)]
*  And I forgot like my two little boys are in there helping me and they don't have the gloves on. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5545.5199999999995s)]
*  They haven't earned the right to have gloves. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5550.72s)]
*  Don't put stuff on the internet. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5552.96s)]
*  Like I once I have a Tesla Model S, one of the very first ones made. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5555.280000000001s)]
*  And I've got friends of coal license plates on it. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5560.8s)]
*  Like in Kentucky, you can get friends of coal. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5563.76s)]
*  It's a totally black hole. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5565.84s)]
*  See, you'll see. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5567.120000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5568.080000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5568.96s)]
*  So because in Kentucky, that's if you plug into the grid, that's likely where your electricity is. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5569.52s)]
*  Or I would think. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5573.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5574.4800000000005s)]
*  So I'm driving this thing back from D.C. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5574.96s)]
*  This was when gas was, you know, getting close to $5 a gallon. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5576.72s)]
*  It was over $4 a gallon. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5579.68s)]
*  And I and I stopped in West Virginia to charge my Tesla at a supercharging station. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5581.599999999999s)]
*  It just to kind of troll people on the internet. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5586.0s)]
*  And I made sure to get a picture of my friends of coal license plate. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5588.5599999999995s)]
*  And I said, I'm just charging up with coal here in West Virginia. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5591.12s)]
*  And within 30 seconds, I knew I'd made a mistake because somebody had zoomed in on the picture and [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5594.5599999999995s)]
*  my tags were expired. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5601.36s)]
*  And they started tagging the Kentucky State Police, my local sheriff, the DMV. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5603.599999999999s)]
*  No way. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5609.599999999999s)]
*  They were trying to get me in trouble. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5611.12s)]
*  And I'm like, there's no way to stop this now. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5612.8s)]
*  And so they were relentless. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5616.0s)]
*  But then somebody realized they had been expired for 18 months. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5619.04s)]
*  And I'd actually made it a year without paying taxes and was maybe likely to get out of a year of taxes. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5622.32s)]
*  Well, it's your win then. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5628.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5629.68s)]
*  But in Kentucky, I think they make you go back and pay the old taxes. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5630.24s)]
*  Anyways, what I learned there is like search everything in the picture before you put it on the. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5634.08s)]
*  Well, yes. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5638.88s)]
*  And others with zest to your personal lives than you have learned this the hard way. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5639.68s)]
*  No, it doesn't seem. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5645.2s)]
*  You've got enough. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5646.4800000000005s)]
*  Minor minor tax evasion issue here. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5647.12s)]
*  You don't have time to be too weird. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5650.56s)]
*  So you get the Tesla battery back to your off grid house. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5652.16s)]
*  And what do you have to do? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5656.16s)]
*  Because it's not made for this. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5658.24s)]
*  It's a car battery. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5659.28s)]
*  It's a car battery. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5660.16s)]
*  It's made to run 400 volts. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5660.96s)]
*  All of my existing system was made to run on 48 volts. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5663.04s)]
*  But there were 16 modules, each nominally 25 volts. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5666.96s)]
*  And I realized if you put two of those in series, you could make 50 volts. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5670.4s)]
*  So I put eight sets of two in series and so put eight paralleled, a paralleled eight sets of two in series. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5674.0s)]
*  So I got 50 volts at a lot more amperage than what the Tesla car would normally draw. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5681.12s)]
*  It was capable of doing that. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5687.44s)]
*  How hard is that to do? [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5689.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, it took a few days. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5693.52s)]
*  But it's lasted for six and a half years. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5696.96s)]
*  I wouldn't advise doing this at home. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5699.36s)]
*  Why? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5702.64s)]
*  Put it in an outbuilding. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5703.6s)]
*  I mean, if it catches on fire, it's probably like Chernobyl, that mini series. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5704.64s)]
*  Don't look at the reactor. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5708.4s)]
*  God cannot put out. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5709.52s)]
*  He created lithium ion, but he can't put the fire out if it starts. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5711.04s)]
*  So I would not attach it to your house. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5715.2s)]
*  Mine is like. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5717.28s)]
*  Is it attached to your house? [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5719.68s)]
*  Kind of, yeah. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5721.12s)]
*  It's like a basement room that's not under the house. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5722.08s)]
*  I don't want to get into everything under my house right now. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5726.16s)]
*  OK, so my wife says our house is my science project and she's the mouse. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5730.16s)]
*  She doesn't mind that, but I keep rearranging the maze on the weekends when I come back from D.C. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5735.12s)]
*  And then she has to find the cheese while I'm in D.C. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5740.08s)]
*  But she's more like the astronaut, I think, in a rocket. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5743.4400000000005s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5746.56s)]
*  She's the only. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5747.68s)]
*  It's the same trust level required. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5748.320000000001s)]
*  Correct, yes. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5750.0s)]
*  She trusts me while I'm in D.C. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5751.200000000001s)]
*  And I trust her to fly the house while she's in Kentucky. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5752.64s)]
*  So what? [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5755.36s)]
*  She's also an MIT graduate. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5756.639999999999s)]
*  So I assume she is like kind of understand some of the stuff. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5757.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5760.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5761.2s)]
*  Although she would like to have just one thing in the house where if something went wrong, [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5762.719999999999s)]
*  she could call somebody, but she can't. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5766.08s)]
*  She's got to like call me and then I walk her through it. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5768.5599999999995s)]
*  By the way, it's a good like marriage security. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5772.0s)]
*  She's like, if we ever whoever broke up or if let's say she put something in my coffee [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5775.599999999999s)]
*  and I didn't wake up the next day, she'd have a hard time running the house. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5781.04s)]
*  So so you put these you put the nodules, which is basically separate batteries. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5786.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5791.679999999999s)]
*  OK, within that. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5792.08s)]
*  And within the big battery battery. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5793.12s)]
*  Then I put a computer on it, a Raspberry Pi, and I made a little graphic screen [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5794.48s)]
*  and the Raspberry Pi using an Arduino talks to the CAN bus, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5799.679999999999s)]
*  which is a proprietary Tesla communication system. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5805.599999999999s)]
*  So I use the battery management system that's native to the Tesla battery modules. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5809.599999999999s)]
*  If there's a nerd listening to this, this makes complete sense. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5814.24s)]
*  And they'll be like, oh, well, why wouldn't you do that? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5817.2s)]
*  And everybody else is going to be like, he's just BSing. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5819.44s)]
*  So did you have to add new software to this to run it? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5822.4s)]
*  I had to write software from scratch. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5825.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5827.44s)]
*  But it's fun. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5830.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, this is what I do. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5831.2s)]
*  Look, I've been in Congress for 12 years. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5832.24s)]
*  My brain has atrophied to the size of a walnut. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5834.32s)]
*  Actually, to a raisin. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5838.719999999999s)]
*  And it expands to a walnut if I can go home and do these projects. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5840.08s)]
*  And then I go back to DC and it's back down to the raisin. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5844.0s)]
*  I believe that. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5848.0s)]
*  I don't understand how these projects work, but I know what brain atrophy looks like. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5848.88s)]
*  And I know that Congress induces it. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5852.32s)]
*  It's not a worm. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5854.4s)]
*  It just shrinks. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5855.2s)]
*  So how does it work? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5856.8s)]
*  It works great. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5859.12s)]
*  We can run the air conditioner. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5859.92s)]
*  Like, for the first 11 years, we had lead acid batteries and they didn't work that great. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5861.44s)]
*  You had to add water to them. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5865.44s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5866.64s)]
*  They put off hydrogen gas, which is explosive. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5867.36s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5870.48s)]
*  They put off a sulfide gas that can kill you. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5871.04s)]
*  Lead acids are bad and they're over 100 years old. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5874.0s)]
*  But by the way, I love solar panels. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5877.76s)]
*  Republicans are like, they look at me like, you have solar panels? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5881.4400000000005s)]
*  You have an electric car? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5884.72s)]
*  Are you sure you're one of us? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5886.56s)]
*  I'm like, well, the solar panels are rocks that make electricity. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5888.320000000001s)]
*  They are amazing things. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5892.24s)]
*  They take sunlight and turn it into something we can all use. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5894.400000000001s)]
*  I tell Republicans, you can hate the subsidies. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5899.84s)]
*  You can hate the bailouts. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5902.56s)]
*  You can hate the mandates. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5904.88s)]
*  I hate all of those things as well. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5906.0s)]
*  But don't hate solar panels. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5907.84s)]
*  Don't hate the technology. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5909.52s)]
*  Right, because it's actually given me and can give other people a license to be independent. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5910.8s)]
*  So let's get specific about it. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5916.96s)]
*  So you have this Tesla battery that allows you to do everything a normal house can do. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5918.24s)]
*  You can run air conditioning. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5922.48s)]
*  You've got a dishwasher. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5923.44s)]
*  You've got washer, dryer. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5924.32s)]
*  I'm assuming all this. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5925.2s)]
*  Four deep freezers, refrigerator. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5926.24s)]
*  Four deep freezers? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5928.32s)]
*  Full of peaches, beef, and chickens. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5929.28s)]
*  Running continuously. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5931.04s)]
*  Continuously. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5932.0s)]
*  So your power draw is significant on all those appliances, obviously. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5934.4s)]
*  And the battery handles it fine. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5938.24s)]
*  How much propane or how much diesel or would I assume you have a generator to recharge? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5940.32s)]
*  Backup generator that runs occasionally in the winter. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5946.08s)]
*  So your solar panels recharge the battery? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5951.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5953.68s)]
*  For nine months out of the year, the backup generator doesn't run except for its test run [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5954.16s)]
*  every Friday. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5958.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5959.28s)]
*  When we bust out the machine guns, like who's in the driveway? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5960.08s)]
*  Okay, back down to level one. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5963.5199999999995s)]
*  That's just the backup generator. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5964.96s)]
*  So your electricity is, I mean, as long as you know how to operate the system, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5968.08s)]
*  which apparently only you do, but if you can do that, then you're just living a completely [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5972.08s)]
*  normal life with electricity. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5977.5199999999995s)]
*  Correct. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5980.16s)]
*  How do you do heat? [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5980.24s)]
*  How do you heat your house? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5981.2s)]
*  So in one of the greenest ways possible. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5982.4s)]
*  Like I think the whole carbon thing is a scam. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5985.12s)]
*  Of course it's a scam. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5987.5199999999995s)]
*  But if you do care about carbon neutrality, I wish we had more carbon. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5988.48s)]
*  We need more CO2. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5992.08s)]
*  And periods in the earth's history, we had more CO2 and plant life was doing better. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5993.919999999999s)]
*  And we've seen plant life, we've seen the coverage of green on the globe increase as [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=5998.48s)]
*  CO2 levels go up. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6003.2s)]
*  Crop production goes up as CO2 levels go up. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6004.799999999999s)]
*  But if you did care about CO2, I am using wood on my farm, like just trees that fall down. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6007.44s)]
*  I'm not even going out and cutting a living tree. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6015.12s)]
*  There's enough trees falling down. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6017.6s)]
*  Dead fall. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6019.6s)]
*  Dead fall that if I don't get to them, the termites do. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6020.240000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6023.68s)]
*  And they turn them into CO2 and methane. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6024.0s)]
*  But I can get to them and cut them up and bring them to my house and burn them in a [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6026.88s)]
*  wood gasifying boiler, which is super efficient. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6031.4400000000005s)]
*  By the way, once you start cutting wood for heat efficiency, like if you figure out a [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6035.4400000000005s)]
*  boiler is twice as efficient, you can cut half as much wood. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6039.76s)]
*  So wood gas, can you, because anyone who's made it this far in the interview is probably [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6042.240000000001s)]
*  interested in wood gasification. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6045.92s)]
*  Can you explain what that is? [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6047.12s)]
*  How is it different from a normal wood fired boiler or a wood stove? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6048.08s)]
*  Yeah, in a normal wood stove, you put the wood in there. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6051.04s)]
*  It can be green. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6054.0s)]
*  You light it on fire. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6056.08s)]
*  You get it going. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6057.12s)]
*  And then you control the air that goes to it to keep it from getting too hot. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6057.92s)]
*  And a lot of smoke comes out, especially when it's idling because it's an inefficient [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6061.92s)]
*  combustion process. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6066.96s)]
*  And it's at a relatively low temperature under, let's say, a thousand degrees. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6068.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6072.8s)]
*  But in a wood gasifying boiler, you get the fire started and it basically turns the wood [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6073.28s)]
*  into charcoal and drives the gases out of it into a secondary chamber that's ceramic [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6077.92s)]
*  because it's burning at over 1500 degrees. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6084.48s)]
*  So some of the stuff that wouldn't you get wood to burn that hot, you just you deprive [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6087.44s)]
*  it of oxygen at first and get it hot. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6091.679999999999s)]
*  And then you drive all the gases off and you put more oxygen in in that secondary chamber. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6095.2s)]
*  And it looks like it's burning gas, like it'll be a blue flame and then it'll turn into [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6100.8s)]
*  a yellow flame. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6106.4800000000005s)]
*  It starts out actually. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6108.8s)]
*  And this is just oak maple beech. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6110.240000000001s)]
*  This is just conventional firewood. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6112.0s)]
*  I burn near wood, nearest wood to the house. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6114.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6116.8s)]
*  Like near what? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6117.2s)]
*  I'm thinking I don't remember that near wood. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6118.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, near wood. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6121.12s)]
*  Near you burn softwood in it. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6121.92s)]
*  You can. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6123.6s)]
*  But the BT again, if you're doing this yourself, care about efficiency. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6124.08s)]
*  Like if you look at the old timers, they were the greenest people on the planet. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6129.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6133.68s)]
*  They didn't waste a thing and they figured out the most efficient way to do things because [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6134.0s)]
*  it was minutes out of their lives. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6139.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6141.2s)]
*  So you start figuring out how to be more efficient when you're trying to be self-sustaining. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6141.599999999999s)]
*  So I've got on my Twitter bio, I used to say, and it may still say this on their [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6146.72s)]
*  greenest member of Congress. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6151.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean I just got there and I'm green. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6153.5199999999995s)]
*  Nobody. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6156.4800000000005s)]
*  I never got any of the fact checkers to come after me on that. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6157.04s)]
*  Nobody wants to fact check me because I probably am the greenest member of Congress. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6160.320000000001s)]
*  Who has self-sustaining food, self-sustaining without externalities, right? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6165.84s)]
*  Self-sustaining power, self-sustaining water. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6172.4800000000005s)]
*  So you heat with wood. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6176.64s)]
*  How much wood do you burn? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6179.360000000001s)]
*  Would you say a season? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6180.400000000001s)]
*  The size of this table, maybe four stacks of wood the size of this table. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6181.68s)]
*  So this is about a quart. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6189.04s)]
*  This is about a quart is four by four by eight. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6190.56s)]
*  So it's like roughly that. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6193.280000000001s)]
*  So four quarts a year. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6194.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6195.76s)]
*  That's not much. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6196.08s)]
*  That's impressive. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6196.88s)]
*  How do you get hot water? [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6198.240000000001s)]
*  We've got three ways to make hot water. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6199.92s)]
*  When our geothermal unit's running in the summertime, doing the air conditioning, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6202.320000000001s)]
*  it takes the heat out of the living room and puts it in the hot water tank. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6206.08s)]
*  So we have free hot water from like May until September when the air conditioner's running. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6209.28s)]
*  And then in the winter when the boiler, the wood boiler is running, that makes hot water. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6215.44s)]
*  And then if there's ever not the air conditioner running or the boiler running, [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6219.92s)]
*  we have an on-demand, this is where we cheat, [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6223.44s)]
*  on-demand propane hot water heater that makes up the difference. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6225.5199999999995s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6229.76s)]
*  But you could pretty easily set up a wood-fired outdoor. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6230.32s)]
*  You could. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6234.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6235.2s)]
*  But in the summer, again, you get it for free from the air conditioning. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6235.599999999999s)]
*  I actually have a fourth way to make hot water too. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6238.96s)]
*  So when we're not connected to the grid, a lot of people who have solar panels [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6243.44s)]
*  are connected to the grid. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6248.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6249.84s)]
*  And if they have extra power, they sell it back. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6249.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6251.84s)]
*  I'm always depressed when I have extra power. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6253.04s)]
*  My solar panels just turn off and I'm like, run around, turn on some lights, turn on something. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6255.44s)]
*  I don't want to waste this free electricity. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6261.68s)]
*  So I got extra hot water heater elements that run on DC. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6264.16s)]
*  So that when the sun, when our house is full, the first thing it does is it tries to charge [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6268.64s)]
*  the Tesla that's sitting in the garage. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6274.32s)]
*  So the Tesla's sitting there at half full and a solid state breaker in my breaker box comes on [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6276.72s)]
*  and starts the Tesla charging. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6281.92s)]
*  Then when the Tesla gets full and the house battery is full, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6283.92s)]
*  I create hot water with the electricity. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6287.5199999999995s)]
*  So I've got like a fourth way to make hot water. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6291.12s)]
*  Hot water is almost as good as water. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6293.76s)]
*  I mean, if you've ever gone without water, you know it's bad. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6296.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6299.2s)]
*  But going out without hot water is almost just as bad. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6299.68s)]
*  Yeah. I have experience with that. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6302.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. Where do you get your water? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6304.5599999999995s)]
*  So I dug a well. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6306.96s)]
*  And dug not drill. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6310.16s)]
*  There are lots of old dug wells on our farm, so I knew it could work. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6313.44s)]
*  The way they would do it, they would dig a big pit. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6317.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6319.68s)]
*  They didn't dig it just straight down. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6320.0s)]
*  They dug a big pit and then they laid up stones in a circle. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6321.68s)]
*  The stones you see when you look in an old well. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6326.32s)]
*  But then they backfilled the pit with stones. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6328.5599999999995s)]
*  So that extra area becomes like a reservoir. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6331.28s)]
*  And then they put dirt on top of that so that when a raccoon poops an extra well, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6334.08s)]
*  it doesn't necessarily go right into the reservoir. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6338.8s)]
*  So I did a very similar thing, but I hit a bedrock and I borrowed a friend's jackhammer [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6341.28s)]
*  and spent a day inside of that hole with a jackhammer trying to get even deeper through [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6348.24s)]
*  the bedrock. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6352.8s)]
*  I finally took my friend's jackhammer back and said, OK, that's deep enough. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6353.36s)]
*  What was the jackhammer like? [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6357.12s)]
*  I mean, that's the best argument for public health care. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6359.5199999999995s)]
*  Because I have a new appreciation for somebody that's running a jackhammer. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6366.32s)]
*  Those would wear your body out quickly. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6373.599999999999s)]
*  Really quickly. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6376.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6376.719999999999s)]
*  Did you lose a crown? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6377.599999999999s)]
*  I did not lose a crown. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6380.24s)]
*  So does the well, the dug well work? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6381.52s)]
*  It works. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6384.0s)]
*  One month out of the year, we're kind of short on water. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6384.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6387.4400000000005s)]
*  August. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6388.320000000001s)]
*  Yes, August. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6389.360000000001s)]
*  How did you know that? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6390.240000000001s)]
*  Have you ever? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6391.040000000001s)]
*  I have a dug well. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6391.6s)]
*  Lived in this situation. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6392.320000000001s)]
*  Yes, I have a dug well, so I'm aware of that. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6393.280000000001s)]
*  But again, you conserve, right? [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6395.84s)]
*  Of course. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6397.68s)]
*  If you're connected to city water and it seems what's on the other side is opaque to you, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6398.88s)]
*  you just use as much as you want. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6403.76s)]
*  And what happens is during those peak periods, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6407.76s)]
*  that's when the utility company has to work extra hard. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6410.48s)]
*  That's when the price and the inefficiency goes way up is in those peak periods, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6413.839999999999s)]
*  when people aren't cutting back in response to the supply because [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6418.16s)]
*  the actual cost of producing it isn't known. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6422.08s)]
*  When you're making it yourself, it's known. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6424.639999999999s)]
*  But I've argued that water and electricity, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6427.28s)]
*  even when they come from, especially when they come from utilities, [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6431.12s)]
*  should have variable pricing based on the cost at that very instant to produce it. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6433.839999999999s)]
*  And then you could have appliances not mandated, but smart appliances. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6440.08s)]
*  If you're rich, you don't care when the price of power goes up. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6444.48s)]
*  You don't know what it costs. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6447.44s)]
*  You don't know what it costs. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6448.32s)]
*  If you're poor and you've got a little screen that says the power just went up, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6449.36s)]
*  you'll go turn it off, right? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6452.72s)]
*  100%. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6453.92s)]
*  You'll say, we'll do the dishes tonight, right, when it's cheaper. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6454.72s)]
*  And if you're middle income, you'll probably, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6458.4s)]
*  eventually the market will respond to this and automate these things so that, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6461.12s)]
*  you know, if you know the price of electricity, your appliance can know the price. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6465.679999999999s)]
*  I don't want the utility company to know what you're doing with it. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6470.16s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6472.96s)]
*  But you can have these smart systems that make a lot more efficient use of our resources. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6473.679999999999s)]
*  So because you're not connected to the grid, to any public utility at all, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6479.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, you're actually independent in a way that no one outside of Alaska I've ever met is. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6484.5599999999995s)]
*  And it sounds like you're not giving up anything. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6490.4s)]
*  You're not living in a- [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6492.639999999999s)]
*  Not too much. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6494.08s)]
*  There are some sacrifices. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6494.96s)]
*  Like? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6496.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, you know, if it's cloudy for a lot of days and hot, we may turn the thermostat up. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6497.12s)]
*  Just so we don't have to hear the backup generator run. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6504.32s)]
*  That doesn't seem like a crazy sacrifice. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6507.28s)]
*  There's some people would think the instant they had to turn the thermostat from 72 to 75 [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6509.44s)]
*  was be screwed, I'm out of here. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6514.4s)]
*  I'm going back to the grid. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6516.96s)]
*  But it means that the state kind of has no control over your land. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6518.08s)]
*  Correct. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6522.64s)]
*  Or me. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6524.16s)]
*  So when I go to DC and they threaten me or try to bribe me, it's like, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6525.6s)]
*  I know once Friday comes, I'm going to be back on my farm and I don't need them. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6531.68s)]
*  It's not that I don't want to do things for people. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6537.92s)]
*  I help my neighbors and my neighbors help me and I want to do public service. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6540.64s)]
*  But because I have this comfort level that I'm going to go back home to this, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6545.68s)]
*  I don't need the job. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6550.4800000000005s)]
*  We're self-sustaining. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6552.56s)]
*  It gives you an extra dimension of independence, I think, when you're in DC. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6554.64s)]
*  What about food? [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6560.96s)]
*  Can they starve you out? [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6561.92s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6565.52s)]
*  They can cut off my fish supply because we don't raise fish and we don't raise pork. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6567.12s)]
*  But we raise chicken, meat and eggs. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6571.4400000000005s)]
*  We raise beef and we usually raise a pretty good garden. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6574.240000000001s)]
*  I have an orchard. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6579.04s)]
*  Peach. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6581.12s)]
*  Peaches, lots of peaches. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6581.76s)]
*  My first peach is going to be ripe here in a few weeks and my last peach will be ripe in September. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6583.92s)]
*  So I've planted 14 kinds of peach trees so they get ripe different weeks [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6588.72s)]
*  and they taste nothing like the cardboard peaches you buy at the supermarket. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6593.92s)]
*  So you don't need to leaf actually your farm? [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6597.2s)]
*  No. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6600.400000000001s)]
*  Are you trying to talk me out of like, I mean, this is a crisis I have some weeks. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6601.04s)]
*  I bet. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6605.280000000001s)]
*  Oh man, on Mondays, it's like, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6606.64s)]
*  you know, you know you're going to get hit with a two by four as soon as you, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6609.36s)]
*  you know, walk in the door in DC. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6612.96s)]
*  It's like, is it weird? [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6616.24s)]
*  I mean, I guess what I'm struck by, I don't live off grid, though I do have an off grid camp. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6617.759999999999s)]
*  But the amount of skills you need to build something like that is really, really striking. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6623.679999999999s)]
*  Like you actually have to know how to do things, complex things. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6629.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, timber framing is another level, but electrical, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6632.879999999999s)]
*  plumbing, masonry, agriculture, heavy equipment operation, like you can do all of that. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6637.12s)]
*  Obviously. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6644.16s)]
*  So is it weird to be in a room with 434 people who can't do shit, who can't operate a micro, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6644.96s)]
*  I mean, they're like actually incapable and maybe that's why they're in politics. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6652.64s)]
*  So they can externalize their self-loathing. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6655.84s)]
*  Is that weird? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6659.12s)]
*  I don't, I really don't think about it that much. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6662.88s)]
*  Good. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6666.0s)]
*  I don't think about it. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6667.599999999999s)]
*  Where'd you pick up plumbing skills? [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6668.96s)]
*  So my rule is buy three books for everything. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6671.04s)]
*  Because you can go to a hardware store and buy a book on plumbing, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6675.44s)]
*  but I don't trust one book, so you buy two books. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6679.44s)]
*  And then if the two books disagree, what are you going to do? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6682.96s)]
*  Well, you got to have a third book. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6685.68s)]
*  So I've got three books on plumbing, three books on wiring, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6687.2s)]
*  three books on septic systems, three books on- [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6690.4s)]
*  You do your septic too. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6693.36s)]
*  Roofing. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6694.32s)]
*  Yep. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6694.88s)]
*  I get three books on everything. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6696.1s)]
*  And you read them. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6698.02s)]
*  And I read them. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6698.82s)]
*  And then there's the code book, which is like, you know, [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6699.46s)]
*  it's almost like international housing code thing that some municipalities have adopted, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6703.46s)]
*  and you have to abide by. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6709.78s)]
*  I just look at that as like a suggestion manual. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6711.78s)]
*  So do you think, now we're way in the weeds, I don't know if anyone's watching, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6715.62s)]
*  but there are like four handymen, carpenter, general contractors are still in this, [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6719.22s)]
*  but do you think that code, which really determines how people live in this country, [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6724.9s)]
*  the code, it's all up to code. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6729.62s)]
*  Is it real? [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6732.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, is it knowing what you do about all those different trades? [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6734.259999999999s)]
*  Does the code protect people actually? [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6738.58s)]
*  It protects the contractors. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6743.139999999999s)]
*  Well, I know that. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6744.98s)]
*  And so they help write it, the unions do. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6745.86s)]
*  So for instance, the roofers union and the plumbers union, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6749.379999999999s)]
*  I think have conspired to put as many holes in your roof with plumbing as possible. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6754.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6759.54s)]
*  Because all the venting, all the vents, right? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6760.5s)]
*  If you try to build a house to code, you're likely to have four or five perforations in your roof. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6762.900000000001s)]
*  I've noticed. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6768.42s)]
*  And that keeps the roofers busy, like to guarantee to get a call every few years to fix that leak. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6769.7s)]
*  And it's also very expensive. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6775.38s)]
*  It's fairly cheap to do roofing, but it's all the exceptions that cost money. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6777.3s)]
*  And then if you're a plumber, that's one more thing. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6781.46s)]
*  Like all the flashing and all that. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6783.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6785.06s)]
*  Every time you have an aperture in a roof, like that's a vulnerability. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6785.46s)]
*  So my roof has no holes in it. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6789.3s)]
*  Like I looked at this and I'm like, well, that's a good suggestion. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6791.62s)]
*  But who benefits if I believe what they're telling me? [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6794.58s)]
*  So you vent your stove at the side of the building? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6796.5s)]
*  No, no holes in my roof, no holes out the side. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6798.5s)]
*  Have you seen that opera house in, I think it's Sydney, Australia? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6801.46s)]
*  Famous opera house. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6804.98s)]
*  Is it Sydney or Melbourne? [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6805.46s)]
*  Sydney, Sydney Opera House. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6806.5s)]
*  Yeah, there's no holes in that. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6807.78s)]
*  There's bathrooms in there. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6809.46s)]
*  How do they do it? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6810.9s)]
*  They have the one way admittance valves like you have under your kitchen counter. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6812.18s)]
*  They have giant ones of those that work for the whole system. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6816.34s)]
*  And they're not to code. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6819.46s)]
*  But I think that's stupid because why would I want to put a bunch of holes in my roof? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6821.38s)]
*  Well, I couldn't agree more. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6824.98s)]
*  I'm interested in this topic. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6826.26s)]
*  So I bet nobody else is now. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6827.46s)]
*  Well, but for the four people who are, I've always wondered that why with wood stoves. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6830.18s)]
*  I live everywhere. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6836.099999999999s)]
*  Lots of wood stoves. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6837.14s)]
*  And some of them I have wood stoves that vent out the side of the building, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6838.42s)]
*  like next to a window, and then do an L up. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6842.58s)]
*  It's not quite as efficient, you know, because you're going to turn in the run. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6846.26s)]
*  But you don't have a hole in your roof and in a climate with like lots of snow, for example. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6849.9400000000005s)]
*  You don't want any holes in your roof. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6854.18s)]
*  But how do you vent your furnace, for example? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6855.78s)]
*  So that I just run in a typical flue and it goes up in the chimney with my pizza oven flue, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6861.06s)]
*  my wood cook stove flue and my Rumford fireplace flue. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6867.38s)]
*  So I have four flues through the chimney. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6870.26s)]
*  On the gable end? [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6872.1s)]
*  No, they're in the middle of the house. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6873.46s)]
*  I put the chimney in the middle of the house because it's a big thermal mass [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6874.900000000001s)]
*  and I wanted to smooth out the changes in temperature in the house. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6879.54s)]
*  And so there's where I did accommodate one hole in the roof is the chimney. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6883.46s)]
*  Because if you put a big stone mass on the side of your house, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6889.22s)]
*  there's no way to insulate it from the outside. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6892.34s)]
*  So by the way, let me say something like I know there are some women watching this wondering, [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6896.02s)]
*  like I want to live in a house like that. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6901.06s)]
*  That sounds like a lot of fun. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6903.14s)]
*  Talk to my wife first. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6904.740000000001s)]
*  Occasionally we have like some crisis that I have to solve and become MacGyver. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6908.02s)]
*  So the first time I got elected to Congress, for instance, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6913.3s)]
*  the day before I went to go get sworn in, the well pump failed. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6916.5s)]
*  And I'm like, I can't leave my wife and four kids at home without water. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6920.5s)]
*  And we have a very unique well pump. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6926.02s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6930.74s)]
*  I didn't buy the one at the hardware store so you can go replace it. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6932.58s)]
*  So I went down there and what did you buy? [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6936.5s)]
*  It's like in a catalog somewhere like the engineer and me found the best one. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6938.74s)]
*  Okay, it's not the most common one, but I had to fix it. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6943.3s)]
*  So what I did is I found one of my drills, [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6945.86s)]
*  like you drill holes with, and I took it down to the well and I took the motor off the well pump [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6949.62s)]
*  and I chucked the drill to the well head. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6956.1s)]
*  Because it's not submerged, it's off the side in a pump house. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6960.18s)]
*  And I had an outlet on it, but I just wired it into the well pump wiring. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6963.38s)]
*  And the drill pumped water for our house. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6968.900000000001s)]
*  I believe that. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6971.38s)]
*  Long enough for me to go get sworn in. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6972.66s)]
*  I've seen that. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6974.900000000001s)]
*  I've seen drills run winches. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6975.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6977.62s)]
*  Well, I forgot it was there. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6978.26s)]
*  Like I did my congress thing. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6980.099999999999s)]
*  But you had it on continuously? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6981.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6983.78s)]
*  And then the accumulator in the basement that controls the pressure would turn the drill off [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6984.26s)]
*  and on whenever it needed more water pressure. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6990.58s)]
*  And so it ran continuously. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6994.18s)]
*  I forgot about it. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6995.7s)]
*  I just got busy. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6996.74s)]
*  And like a year later, a freaking water quit working again. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=6997.7s)]
*  Because the Makita died? [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7001.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7003.0599999999995s)]
*  It was actually a Milwaukee hole. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7003.62s)]
*  It was? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7005.14s)]
*  The whole hog. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7005.7s)]
*  One of those. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7006.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7007.0599999999995s)]
*  No, I totally do what the handle on the side. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7008.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7010.0199999999995s)]
*  Those are cool drills. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7011.139999999999s)]
*  So you, last night, I just want to end with this. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7012.58s)]
*  Last night we were having dinner and, which was really one of the most interesting amusing [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7015.3s)]
*  dinners I've ever had. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7020.099999999999s)]
*  But you made reference to a story, but you didn't get a chance to finish it because I [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7021.78s)]
*  interrupted you. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7026.9s)]
*  But about putting new plumbing in a county jail, I think. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7027.94s)]
*  Would you tell that story? [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7032.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7033.3s)]
*  So quickly, I got into politics because we were living off the grid. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7033.54s)]
*  And I read this little newspaper and it said they were going to raise our taxes to fund [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7040.0199999999995s)]
*  this cronyism in the county, the conservation district, which was building stuff for themselves [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7044.74s)]
*  and not for other farmers. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7050.26s)]
*  They wanted to tax other farmers to help their farm, right? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7051.46s)]
*  It wasn't really about conserving. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7054.34s)]
*  Farmers are the best conservationists there are. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7056.18s)]
*  So let's don't punish them anymore. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7058.82s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7060.34s)]
*  Good call. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7060.66s)]
*  So I fought that tax and then I actually fought zoning in our county. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7061.3s)]
*  They wanted to zone our county. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7065.38s)]
*  I mean, zoning is to keep the smokestacks out of the cul-de-sacs. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7066.820000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7070.5s)]
*  My county didn't have any smokestacks and didn't have any cul-de-sacs, right? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7070.9800000000005s)]
*  We did the, like the neighborhood and ET, you know, that movie where the kids ride their [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7074.5s)]
*  bikes through the neighborhood. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7079.22s)]
*  We didn't have neighborhoods like that. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7080.26s)]
*  So we didn't need zoning, but somebody thought if we zoned the county that we would get [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7081.7s)]
*  prosperity because they saw all the prosperous counties had zoning. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7086.58s)]
*  I love that. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7089.54s)]
*  It's cargo cult. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7091.06s)]
*  But totally. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7092.02s)]
*  It's like saying we should import some homeless because then we'll have banks. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7092.900000000001s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7096.34s)]
*  JP Morgan will move here because in Midtown, they're homeless. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7097.54s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7100.900000000001s)]
*  So that was, I was fighting that and writing letters to the editor. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7101.620000000001s)]
*  And then finally I quit fighting the guy who was doing all this. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7104.9800000000005s)]
*  He's called the county judge executive in Kentucky, like the mayor of the county. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7109.3s)]
*  And I decided to run against him. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7112.580000000001s)]
*  So you've never been in politics. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7114.740000000001s)]
*  Never in my life. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7116.18s)]
*  Also, there was this guy named Rand Paul who was inspiring. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7118.02s)]
*  He was taking on the establishment. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7121.54s)]
*  It was his first run for Senate and it decided to get involved in his race too. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7123.22s)]
*  So just like with my house, I didn't go in part way. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7126.900000000001s)]
*  I went in all in. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7129.620000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7131.06s)]
*  On politics one fall, actually one spring because I had to win the primary and Rand did too. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7131.700000000001s)]
*  And so I actually did a fundraiser for Rand at my house. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7136.820000000001s)]
*  Nobody wanted to do a fundraiser for Rand Paul because he was running against the establishment. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7141.620000000001s)]
*  My house wasn't finished. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7146.42s)]
*  We weren't even living in it yet. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7147.46s)]
*  Sorry, little sidebar. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7149.46s)]
*  But you traipsed up from the double wide. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7150.42s)]
*  Yes, we went to the double wide and we said for a hundred dollars, you can come to our pizza party. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7151.860000000001s)]
*  I did have the pizza oven working. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7157.22s)]
*  And so you built the pizza oven before the bedrooms? [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7159.78s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7162.66s)]
*  It's priorities. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7163.7s)]
*  That's right. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7164.58s)]
*  Had to test it out, make sure it was inhabitable. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7165.22s)]
*  So the funny thing too, we didn't have doors on the bathrooms at the time. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7168.1s)]
*  We had no doors. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7172.82s)]
*  So we did run to Lowe's the day before Rand Paul came and put a door on the bathroom. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7174.34s)]
*  Good call. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7179.62s)]
*  Because I was like, look, this guy could be a senator someday and he might need to go to the [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7180.5s)]
*  bathroom and we need something more than a curtain here. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7185.22s)]
*  So we call it the Rand Paul door on the bathroom. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7187.94s)]
*  It's the one room that had a door from the very beginning. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7190.26s)]
*  Anyways, by the way, also this was in January and Rand is cheap as hell. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7194.58s)]
*  He had a two-wheel drive SUV. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7199.62s)]
*  So I had to plow all my driveway so that he could get up there. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7201.9400000000005s)]
*  And the problem is it's gravel. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7206.9800000000005s)]
*  So I had to plow all my gravel off practically just to get. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7208.5s)]
*  So for what it costs to upgrade to the four-wheel drive for Rand Paul, [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7211.38s)]
*  my gravel costs way more than that. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7215.54s)]
*  Anyways, I went all in on politics, helped Rand get elected in his primary. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7217.54s)]
*  I was on the ballot the same day in 2010, the primary, May 22nd, 2010. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7222.740000000001s)]
*  Rand was on the ballot and I was on the ballot, but I was running for this little county [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7228.1s)]
*  executive seat trying to take a Republican out because he's trying to raise our taxes [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7231.780000000001s)]
*  and bring in more government. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7235.620000000001s)]
*  And so I won the election and it was the most terrifying thing when they handed me the key [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7237.22s)]
*  to the courthouse. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7242.34s)]
*  Like it's a small town and if the janitor didn't show up to open the courthouse and start the [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7243.46s)]
*  boiler, which looked like the African queen, like it was like, you had to kick it and do [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7248.9800000000005s)]
*  all this stuff to get it started. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7255.14s)]
*  The sheriff's office wouldn't be heated, the clerk's office wouldn't be heated, and my [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7256.82s)]
*  office wouldn't be heated if I couldn't get the African queen to start. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7260.58s)]
*  So anyways, it was like the dog that caught the bus and I had promised I wouldn't raise [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7264.82s)]
*  taxes. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7269.94s)]
*  And I was immediately confronted with all these problems that had accumulated over the [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7270.66s)]
*  years in our county government. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7275.54s)]
*  And the jailer came to me who's an elected official in Kentucky. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7277.54s)]
*  His name's Chris and he got elected the same day I got elected. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7281.54s)]
*  He was all in on my, you know, let's reform this county. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7285.86s)]
*  But he had some bad news for me. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7289.139999999999s)]
*  By the way, the state government had sold the county government a bill of goods. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7291.78s)]
*  They said, if you'll keep our state inmates, we'll pay you $32 a day and you'll make all [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7295.219999999999s)]
*  kinds of money. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7299.299999999999s)]
*  And the county was a million dollars in debt because this did not work out. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7300.58s)]
*  And I wasn't going to spend another penny, you know, on this throwing good money after bad. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7305.46s)]
*  And but we had 30, 30 state inmates who go out and pick up trash and, you know, mow around [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7311.22s)]
*  the courthouse and they get real sweaty. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7317.54s)]
*  And the hot water heater had quit working at the jail. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7320.82s)]
*  And so the jailer, Chris comes to me and says, Judge, they call me Judge, even though I'm not [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7324.74s)]
*  an attorney. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7330.58s)]
*  He was the county judge executive. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7331.139999999999s)]
*  Said, Judge, I got some bad news. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7332.98s)]
*  He said, what's that? [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7334.82s)]
*  He said, well, hot water heater quit working on the state inmate side and I can't mix state [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7335.38s)]
*  inmates with local inmates. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7339.7s)]
*  You know, you get murderers along with non-support, you know, for child support. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7340.9s)]
*  Oh, totally, in DUI cases. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7344.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7346.58s)]
*  It's like this. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7346.9s)]
*  We can't have them taking showers together. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7347.62s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7349.38s)]
*  And I said, OK, well, just buy another hot water heater. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7351.3s)]
*  And he said, well, I tried that. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7354.66s)]
*  I got a quote. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7355.86s)]
*  We only had one licensed plumber in the county. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7356.66s)]
*  And I said, well, what was the quote? [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7359.62s)]
*  He said, $12,000. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7360.9s)]
*  I said, I mean, this is a small county. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7362.5s)]
*  For a hot water heater? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7364.98s)]
*  For a hot water heater. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7365.94s)]
*  All of our property taxes together were like $400,000. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7366.82s)]
*  I mean, $12,000 for a hot water heater? [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7369.62s)]
*  I'm not paying $12,000 for a hot water heater. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7372.099999999999s)]
*  You tell that guy to get lost. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7375.38s)]
*  And he said, well, what are you going to do? [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7377.38s)]
*  I was like, I'll go buy one at the hardware store or something. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7378.9s)]
*  So I go look at this hot water heater at the jail. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7382.66s)]
*  It is not the kind you buy at the store. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7384.9s)]
*  It's like a boiler almost. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7387.46s)]
*  And it's fairly involved. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7389.7s)]
*  It's got like inch and a quarter copper lines. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7391.219999999999s)]
*  It's not household plumbing. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7393.7s)]
*  But I had three books on plumbing. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7395.94s)]
*  I felt fairly confident. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7398.58s)]
*  I said, well, if I can find one of these, I'll put it in myself. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7400.66s)]
*  So I got on eBay. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7404.099999999999s)]
*  And I looked for this model hot water heater. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7406.179999999999s)]
*  There was one, buy it now for $5,500. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7408.099999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, I can save the county like $6,500. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7411.379999999999s)]
*  So I called an emergency meeting of our fiscal court, [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7415.0599999999995s)]
*  brought in the magistrates, noticed it to the newspaper, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7418.099999999999s)]
*  did it all legally, and made a motion to buy it now on eBay. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7420.98s)]
*  Then I hit the button. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7425.459999999999s)]
*  I bought this hot water heater. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7427.139999999999s)]
*  They bring it in a tractor trailer. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7428.98s)]
*  I didn't pay extra for the lift gate because I had inmates. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7430.419999999999s)]
*  The inmates take this thing out of the tractor trailer. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7435.299999999999s)]
*  And we go in and we take the old hot water heater out. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7438.259999999999s)]
*  And there were three inmates in that closet, right? [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7441.459999999999s)]
*  Working on that hot water heater, just demolishing everything. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7445.7s)]
*  So they dragged that thing out of there. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7449.0599999999995s)]
*  And I had to go in the closet with the inmates to put the new one in. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7451.22s)]
*  I'm like, I only want one inmate in that closet with me. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7455.3s)]
*  The hot water heater needs plumbed. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7459.860000000001s)]
*  I don't need plumbed. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7461.700000000001s)]
*  So the other two inmates that were smelling pretty rank at this point, [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7463.3s)]
*  I said, you guys go strip the old hot water heater. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7468.660000000001s)]
*  I want anything of value on that. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7472.02s)]
*  Besides, you're in here for stripping copper and other things. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7474.26s)]
*  You're good at this. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7478.1s)]
*  We can do this, judge. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7479.22s)]
*  We know short irons bringing this, tins bringing this, copper will bring this, aluminum. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7480.9800000000005s)]
*  They could quote every price at the salvage. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7485.62s)]
*  Seriously? [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7487.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7488.34s)]
*  So I leave the two inmates stripping the old hot water heater. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7489.06s)]
*  And it had a computer on it and stuff. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7492.74s)]
*  And I'm installing the new hot water heater. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7495.14s)]
*  And I noticed, for instance, even the plumber had left off this water trap [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7497.06s)]
*  that keeps gases from escaping like a safety device. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7502.66s)]
*  So I made sure to do it completely safe by the book [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7505.62s)]
*  or by the three books that I had. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7508.9s)]
*  And I come out of the closet. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7511.139999999999s)]
*  By the way, there's like 30 inmates. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7513.86s)]
*  I had to walk by the rec room that had a piece of glass [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7516.099999999999s)]
*  and they could all watch me changing this hot water heater. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7519.0599999999995s)]
*  And there's like 30 inmates like in disbelief with their hands and faces pressed to the glass. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7522.099999999999s)]
*  Like we have never seen a county judge executive [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7526.58s)]
*  get a callus on his hand or do anything. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7530.0199999999995s)]
*  So I go back out and the inmates said, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7533.0599999999995s)]
*  we got everything of value. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7537.3s)]
*  There was this hulk of an old hot water heater sitting there. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7538.9s)]
*  They had stripped the copper. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7542.5s)]
*  They had stripped all of the useful iron off of it. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7543.94s)]
*  And I said, guys, you left the most valuable thing on it. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7547.54s)]
*  They said, no, Judge, we've done this all our lives. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7551.3s)]
*  We stripped these things. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7553.54s)]
*  There's nothing on here that'll bring anything down at Livingston's. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7554.9s)]
*  That was the junkyard place, recycling place. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7557.94s)]
*  And I said, no, you left the most valuable thing. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7561.14s)]
*  I said, come over here. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7564.18s)]
*  And they walk over and I said, you see this lime green inspection sticker? [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7565.54s)]
*  Get it wet and peel it off and glue it on the new hot water heater. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7570.18s)]
*  Remember, I'd refused to hire the only licensed plumber in the county. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7576.66s)]
*  They go, Judge, you could go to jail for this. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7580.58s)]
*  I said, I'll have a hot shower, won't I? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7583.94s)]
*  You actually did that? [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7587.94s)]
*  I did that. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7588.82s)]
*  And the only reason I'm telling you this publicly is this was [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7589.7s)]
*  how long was it? [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7595.86s)]
*  Like 15 years ago or something. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7596.58s)]
*  And, you know, 14 years ago, I think the statute of limitations, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7598.9800000000005s)]
*  you know, practicing it without a license as a plumber on a public building [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7603.22s)]
*  has probably expired. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7607.3s)]
*  If not, the DOJ will be at my house as soon as this airs. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7608.26s)]
*  But they have also since closed down the jail. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7611.46s)]
*  Like a few years later, it was a good move. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7614.5s)]
*  Did they take the water heater with them? [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7617.14s)]
*  You know, it's on my bucket list. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7619.62s)]
*  It may still be in there. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7621.14s)]
*  So what are they using it for now? [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7622.26s)]
*  It's I think it's just vacant. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7624.5s)]
*  Maybe they'll use it for drug rehab or something at some point, [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7627.94s)]
*  which would make more sense. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7630.66s)]
*  But did it work? [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7631.54s)]
*  Did your hot water? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7632.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7634.18s)]
*  It booted up. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7634.66s)]
*  The computer came on and everybody got, I mean, 30 inmates just waiting [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7635.62s)]
*  to take a hot shower and it worked and worked to work until they shut the jail down. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7640.02s)]
*  So incredible. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7644.34s)]
*  But anyways, that set the tone. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7645.46s)]
*  Like you could say, well, you're the executive of the county and you [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7649.14s)]
*  shouldn't be wasting your time on that. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7652.34s)]
*  But I mean, I had four hours of effort in it and I saved the county $6,500. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7653.86s)]
*  And I'm like, no, this is worth my time. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7659.86s)]
*  And it also shows the inmates like, OK, we're buying you dollar 50 [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7662.179999999999s)]
*  lunches instead of the $2 lunches now because we fired the crony who was doing the food system. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7667.139999999999s)]
*  Totally. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7671.78s)]
*  And they were less likely to complain when they saw that the judge himself was actually [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7672.5s)]
*  willing to change the hot water heater. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7677.94s)]
*  But it also set the tone for the sheriff and the county clerk [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7679.94s)]
*  and everybody else who sees that. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7683.62s)]
*  And it's like, man, he is a cheap bastard. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7685.22s)]
*  Like, I'm not going to go ask him at the Ness Fiscal Court meeting for anything. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7688.18s)]
*  Why don't you tell the story to APAC and maybe they'll leave you alone. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7692.5s)]
*  It's like, it's not personal. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7695.38s)]
*  I'm not against you or your country. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7696.58s)]
*  I just don't want to spend more money. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7697.86s)]
*  By the way, I'm traveling. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7699.3s)]
*  There will be some plumbing lobby against me next week after they see this. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7700.34s)]
*  Well, the one thing I know for a fact is that you will bravely [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7705.3s)]
*  stand up to the irate plumbing lobby. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7708.82s)]
*  I will. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7711.22s)]
*  One more story about lobbies. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7711.94s)]
*  So I introduced this raw milk bill in Congress. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7714.66s)]
*  And I, you know, food freedom, empower small farmers. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7718.74s)]
*  It's more nutritious. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7721.78s)]
*  I thought there was nothing to hate about it. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7722.98s)]
*  I got 20 co-sponsors. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7724.82s)]
*  I put it in the hopper. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7726.419999999999s)]
*  I got my HR number. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7727.379999999999s)]
*  And that day, the milk lobby comes after me. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7728.74s)]
*  Like, they said there wouldn't be enough hospital rooms for all the children who were [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7731.78s)]
*  going to die from raw milk if my bill passed. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7735.299999999999s)]
*  And this is kind of weird. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7738.66s)]
*  You've got a lobby going after its own product, the milk lobby. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7740.58s)]
*  So my wife saw all these things come up on her alerts on her phone and she texted me. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7744.5s)]
*  She was worried about me and she says, OMG, I didn't realize the lactose lobby was this [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7749.54s)]
*  intolerant. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7753.78s)]
*  Oh, that's brilliant. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7755.0599999999995s)]
*  You said that. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7757.14s)]
*  That's pretty awesome. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7758.5s)]
*  Thomas Massey. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7761.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7762.42s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7763.38s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBSEuFTYEo&t=7764.34s)]
