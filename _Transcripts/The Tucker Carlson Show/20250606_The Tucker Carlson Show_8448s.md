Video Description: Doctors told a teenage Laura Delano she had something they called bipolar disorder, and then proceeded to make her legitimately crazy with psych drugs. She’s one of the few who recovered.
Laura Delano is an author, speaker, and consultant, and the founder of Inner Compass Initiative, a nonprofit organization that helps people make more informed choices about taking and safely tapering off psychiatric drugs. She is a leading voice in the international movement of people who’ve left behind the medicalized, professionalized mental health industry to build something different. Laura has worked as an advocate within and beyond the mental health system, and has spent the past 13 years working with individuals and families around the world who are seeking guidance and support for psychiatric drug withdrawal. Her book, Unshrunk: A Story of Psychiatric Treatment Resistance, was published in March 2025.

# Laura Delano: The Dark Truth About Antidepressants, SSRIs, and the Psychiatrists Lying for Profit
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk)
*  If you're being told, you know, you have a chemical imbalance, Tucker, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=0.0s)]
*  here's some Prozac, it's going to help adjust the chemicals. That's a lie. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3.12s)]
*  If something's an imbalance, what's balance? Is there any science behind that at all? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7.2s)]
*  No. It has never been proven. Most people believe that mental illness, you know, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=11.44s)]
*  that depression, all these things are caused by chemical imbalances. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=19.44s)]
*  66 million Americans total on these. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  According to the CDC in 2022, so those numbers could well be higher. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=24.16s)]
*  That's craziness. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=28.16s)]
*  There's this condition called PSSD, post SSRI sexual dysfunction. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=29.92s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=34.72s)]
*  There's a whole movement. They're incredibly well organized on X doing really important [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=35.36s)]
*  public awareness work around how many people either never regain sexual function when they [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=40.64s)]
*  come off. What? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=45.6s)]
*  Some people haven't regained it for years and- [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=46.8s)]
*  So there's dead. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=49.44s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=50.96s)]
*  Okay. Really? And no one's going to jail for this? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  So I read this piece in the New York Times about you that's like actually kind of hostile. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=58.16s)]
*  And the story seems to be that you were on psych meds for a lot of your young life and then you [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=81.12s)]
*  got off them and that's bad. That's bad. You might lead people to do the same. You might lead them [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=86.16s)]
*  astray off psychiatric medication, out of therapy and into like independent happy life. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=94.64s)]
*  Why would anyone be mad at you for getting off psych drugs? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=101.6s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=106.88s)]
*  I mean, I think really there's just so much fear and greed and disconnection from [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=107.78s)]
*  emotional pain that people hear a story of someone who's decided to let go of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=125.22s)]
*  dependence on professionals and pills and institutions and they just can't fathom [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=132.58s)]
*  trying it for themselves because they've built their whole lives around this idea of being sick [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  and needing treatment and needing medical expertise and institutional authorities to guide them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=143.78s)]
*  So to hear a story of someone who said, I'm not going to do that anymore, is to basically call [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=149.94s)]
*  into question their entire existence, their entire identity, their entire sense of self and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=155.78s)]
*  purpose in the world. And it makes me feel sad. I feel sad about it because I'm just sharing my [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=161.62s)]
*  story. I'm not telling anyone what to do. I'm just talking about what I did. And yet somehow [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=168.5s)]
*  a lot of people out there think I'm insulting them or attacking them. It baffles me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=174.1s)]
*  It's just, and I understand everything that you've said. I mean, I think you've got a lot [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=180.26000000000002s)]
*  of detail on this, but the country is pretty much addicted to these drugs. Like a huge percentage [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=186.26000000000002s)]
*  of the population takes them, can't get off them, unclear if they're benefiting from them. So I [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=190.66000000000003s)]
*  understand that you're poking at something that people rarely mention in public and that goes [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  deep. On the other hand, I thought the goal was health and independence and joy and connection [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=200.82000000000002s)]
*  between people and productivity and creativity. And it doesn't even seem like those are considered [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=208.82s)]
*  virtuous goals by the New York Times, which does kind of give me the creeps a little bit. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=215.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's fascinating. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=220.26s)]
*  Well, it is. It's dark. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=221.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't know if you looked at the comments on that New York Times article, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=223.54s)]
*  or if you heard about the kerfuffle that article caused the readership of the New York Times, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=228.34s)]
*  but they had to shut the comments down after 1300 just poured right in within a day of the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=234.58s)]
*  article being out because people were just so outraged at how, basically what a fascist I am [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=241.22000000000003s)]
*  for entertaining the idea that you can take your body and your wellbeing and your identity back [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  from a very powerful industry that profits off of us being afraid of our suffering. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=258.82s)]
*  I'm literally a fascist now. I've been called- [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=265.38s)]
*  Because you live quietly with your family in New England, not wanting to bother anybody or tell [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=267.7s)]
*  anyone what to do, but you're for nature and peace and independence and that makes you a fascist. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=272.42s)]
*  Basically. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=277.78s)]
*  So amazing. Okay. I just wanted to set the stage for your story. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=279.62s)]
*  So you're from Connecticut. You come from an attack family. I heard all of this. It's an amazing [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=286.98s)]
*  story. But you wound up on psychiatric medications and it began this whole odyssey. Can you just [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=293.06s)]
*  tell us what happened to you? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=301.54s)]
*  Sure. So I grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut, which is, you picture the most stereotypical [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=302.82s)]
*  upper middle-class affluent New England town and it's Greenwich. I was the kind of kid who was [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=309.3s)]
*  good at school, so I happened to know how to get A's on tests and memorize and regurgitate [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=319.14s)]
*  information well and follow the instructions of adult authority figures. So I was good at school. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=325.62s)]
*  I was a good athlete on paper. I had it all together, you could say. But when I was 13, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=333.78s)]
*  I ended up having this profound experience one night in front of the bathroom mirror [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=341.46s)]
*  as I was brushing my teeth and I had been elected president of the middle school at my all girls [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=347.05999999999995s)]
*  private school. And the next day I was going to lead an assembly with the headmistress and I [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=352.26s)]
*  started looking deeper and deeper into my eyes as I was thinking about all that I had on my plate. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=357.14s)]
*  And I ended up having this profound out of body experience where I lost touch with [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=361.62s)]
*  space and time and everything went black around me and I was just staring at this girl in the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=368.58000000000004s)]
*  mirror until suddenly a stranger was looking back at me and I was like, who is she? Who is she? What [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  is this girl doing looking at me? I just was totally out of reality. And when I came to the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=378.74s)]
*  only conclusion I could draw about what this meant was that I didn't have a real self. I was just [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=385.94s)]
*  this programmed robot who had been raised to perform well and have it all together. But who [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=392.18s)]
*  was I really? What did I really care about? What did I want to do with my life? I didn't know the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=398.98s)]
*  answer to that and that terrified me. And so I ended up trying to repress what had happened and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=404.5s)]
*  pretended hadn't happened. I didn't tell anyone about this out of body experience I'd had and I [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=409.62s)]
*  just continued on performing well. But at home eventually I began to just, I couldn't hold it [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=415.46s)]
*  all in anymore. So I began to act out and scream and curse and I started to get physical and I pushed [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=422.34s)]
*  my mother. I'd terrified my sisters. I started slicing up my arms. I started thinking about [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=428.09999999999997s)]
*  death because what was the point to this game that I had no agency in? And my poor parents [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=433.78s)]
*  were just shocked and stunned at what had happened to their eldest daughter seemingly overnight. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=440.73999999999995s)]
*  She was this maniac basically. And so they did what so many loving American parents are taught to do [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=445.85999999999996s)]
*  when their child is struggling. They took me to a professional because they internalized this story [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  that they didn't have what they needed to help me. They needed to pay someone who'd studied about [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=460.9s)]
*  kids like me to help. So they sent me to a therapist. Your parents are, I identify with [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=469.46s)]
*  the parent in this, you know they love you. They think everything's going great. You're killing it [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=475.62s)]
*  in school. You're staying within the boundaries and then like they don't have any idea what to do [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=480.58s)]
*  basically. Yep. But they're motivated by love. Is that very much so? Very much so. They did what they [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=488.02s)]
*  thought would be the most helpful for me. They're the opposite of negligent. I guess that's what I [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=495.29999999999995s)]
*  want to say. Like they're engaged. Yeah. They did the best they could with the information [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=499.06s)]
*  that they had at their disposal, which was really all they saw as a resource was the mental health [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=506.42s)]
*  system. There weren't any visible support groups for parents of struggling teens. No one was talking [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=512.02s)]
*  about, my gosh is your daughter also slicing up her arms too? No one talked about this then. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=518.98s)]
*  And so the only visible source they saw was a mental health professional. And so, and this woman [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=525.6999999999999s)]
*  was, the therapist was a very kind woman. She had the best of intentions. But when I was sent to see [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=532.9799999999999s)]
*  her each week, to me at the time, I experienced it as this profound violation of my very being. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=539.3s)]
*  I interpreted this as a sign that everyone around me thought I was defective. I was the problem. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=549.3s)]
*  And I knew in my heart that the anger I felt and the despair I felt were actually really [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=554.74s)]
*  meaningful responses to the environment that I was growing up in. This really high-pressured, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=559.38s)]
*  intense environment where it's just in the air itself that if you want to feel good about yourself, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=565.3s)]
*  you have to excel. And I knew that that was the problem, not me. But of course, I was 13. I didn't [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=570.8199999999999s)]
*  have the language to articulate this. I didn't have the sense of self yet to stand up for myself. So [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  I ended up doing what I, being sent to therapy each week. I felt humiliated. I felt ashamed. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=584.5s)]
*  My poor parents didn't mean to cause that in me, but I just, I experienced therapy as basically [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=592.66s)]
*  a statement that I wasn't good enough as I was. And so it wasn't that long before the therapist [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=600.26s)]
*  ended up recommending to my parents that they send me to a psychiatrist because I was pretty [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=606.66s)]
*  extreme. My difficulties were, you know, not, it wasn't enough to just see a therapist. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=612.02s)]
*  And so my parents took me to a psychiatrist. My mom took me to my first appointment. And [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=618.9s)]
*  in that first session, I was 14 by this time, in that first session, after sitting down with this [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=626.26s)]
*  woman, the stranger who I'd never met before, I think she'd been given some information about me [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=632.18s)]
*  by my parents and that therapist, but I'd never met her. I poured out all my pain to her. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=638.1800000000001s)]
*  And at the end of that session, she said, have you heard of something called bipolar disorder? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=644.9000000000001s)]
*  And I was like, what? And she said, well, this anger that you feel, this irritability, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=651.38s)]
*  these rages you're getting into, these are symptoms of something we call mania. And the despair and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=658.74s)]
*  the injuring you're doing to yourself, these are symptoms of depression. And this is a condition [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=665.46s)]
*  that you'll have for the rest of your life, but don't worry, there are medications that will help [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=671.38s)]
*  you manage this. At 14, she told you you're stuck with this for life? For life. For life. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=675.14s)]
*  That's how it always is. Anytime you're given a diagnosis by a psychiatrist, you know, the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=682.1s)]
*  baseline operating assumption is that this thing we call mental illness is an incurable condition [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=687.14s)]
*  that you treat and you manage. But that forms the premise of the entire business model of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=693.86s)]
*  the psychiatric industry is that these are incurable conditions that require treatment [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=700.42s)]
*  indefinitely. And there I was hearing this message as a 14-year-old girl. I'm like, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=705.38s)]
*  excuse my language. I'm like, who the fuck does this woman think she is? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=710.5s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=713.62s)]
*  But that defiance that I felt, you know, I had no one, I knew I couldn't resist that if I resisted, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=715.46s)]
*  that would be used against me. So I just went along with it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=726.02s)]
*  It's like you've been taken by the Bulgarian border police in 1975, resistance is futile. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=731.94s)]
*  Well, it totally is. And interestingly, just to like pan out for a moment to this whole broader [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=738.42s)]
*  mental health industry, you know, at scale, that is when you many people who resist their diagnosis [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=743.54s)]
*  or who tell their doctors, I don't think I'm sick, or that's actually is used literally to [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=751.46s)]
*  reinforce just how sick you are. You lack insight, quote unquote, into your condition. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=756.66s)]
*  So Soviet. I mean, so like listening to the patient is that's been taken out of the process? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=763.3s)]
*  It has. Well, in the sense that, of course, the psychiatrist is listening [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=770.8199999999999s)]
*  for signs of symptoms, you know, okay, I'm listening past what they're saying, so I can [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=775.06s)]
*  determine if this person is entering a hypomanic episode or her depression is worse worsening, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=779.9399999999999s)]
*  but they're not listening to the patient. I'll speak for myself, my whole very well-meaning [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=785.54s)]
*  therapists and doctors over the years were not actually listening to me from a premise of me [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=791.7s)]
*  knowing myself better than them, of me having wisdom, of me, you know, they lacked a respect [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=802.98s)]
*  for my own ability to kind of define for myself what my reality meant. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=812.58s)]
*  Sounds like they went into the sessions knowing what you were sick with and everything that you [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=819.6999999999999s)]
*  said was confirmation of what they already knew. Exactly. It's all filtered through this clinical [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=826.8199999999999s)]
*  lens of translating your, you know, deep human experiences into this clinicalized language of [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=831.38s)]
*  symptom, illness, disease. And so they're just they're trained to do that. And what ended up [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=840.8199999999999s)]
*  happening to me when I eventually bought into all of this by the time I was 18 is I learned how to [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=847.38s)]
*  do that to myself. And I just came to translate every single thought, emotion, behavior, decision [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=852.5s)]
*  through this medicalized lens of me having this sickness that was incurable and that these were [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=860.98s)]
*  all symptoms of it basically. Okay, so you're 14, can you imagine telling a 14 year old you have a [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=868.98s)]
*  lifelong illness from which you will never recover that will define you going forward? At 14, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=874.6600000000001s)]
*  you're telling somebody that. On the basis of what evidence? Like where did you catch this [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=880.1s)]
*  illness? Like in the ladies room at an airport? Like where did they explain where you got this [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=884.58s)]
*  illness? It's a very good question, Tucker. And it's a question that we should be asking all the time [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=889.14s)]
*  about literally every single psychiatric diagnosis that is ever given to any human being because the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=895.38s)]
*  entire model is built on subjectivity. It's built on the subjective observations of the diagnosing [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=900.74s)]
*  clinician, which of course means it will be infused by their own personality, like whether [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=909.54s)]
*  they had a bad night's sleep, they just had a fight with their spouse an hour earlier and they're [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=915.78s)]
*  grumpy, you know, it's going to infuse how they see their their patients. There are no objective [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=919.7s)]
*  biological tests, there are no brain scans, lab tests that you can do to say, oh, this is proof [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=924.98s)]
*  that you have this, you know, chemical imbalance in your brain or this, you know, faulty biomarker. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=932.58s)]
*  There's no objective measurable pathology of any kind in any of these conditions, literally, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=939.62s)]
*  all of them, including the so-called serious ones like bipolar and schizophrenia. It is completely [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=946.82s)]
*  based on observation. But is there any explanation for so if so they're telling you they're looking [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=952.66s)]
*  forward in to the next 70 years of your life and saying this is going to be with you forever, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=958.66s)]
*  kind of incumbent on them to explain where you got this thing, its nature, like what exactly are they [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=963.86s)]
*  talking about? Did anybody ever explain any of that? No, and in large part because I never asked. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=969.62s)]
*  I mean, of course, I didn't ask as a kid. I was just so flummoxed by the whole and disoriented by [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=975.86s)]
*  this whole experience that it didn't even occur to me to be like, can you prove that I have an [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=982.9s)]
*  incurable brain disease? But honestly, I'm sorry, Lord, to say you have terminal cancer, we can keep [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=987.22s)]
*  you alive for decades, but it's terminal. That's like so nuts to say that to a child on the base [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=993.78s)]
*  of no evidence like. But the entire paradigm is that for every single person who has ever been [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1000.58s)]
*  given a psychiatric diagnosis in the history of psychiatric diagnosis, it's always that. It's [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1007.62s)]
*  always just the opinion of the clinician based on his or her personal orientation. It's the entire [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1012.1s)]
*  thing. And I did not realize this because it never occurred to me to step back and ask these [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1021.86s)]
*  questions. And I think most, maybe I shouldn't presume most, but many people don't either because [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1027.78s)]
*  when I ended up eventually buying into all of this a few years after that first psychiatrist, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1037.06s)]
*  as an 18 year old, I'd continued through high school playing the performance game, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1043.3s)]
*  knowing it was bullshit, but not knowing how to get out of it. So I ended up getting into Harvard [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1049.78s)]
*  and trying to tell myself, you know, maybe I'm wrong and I will actually feel okay in my skin [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1054.18s)]
*  once I get to Harvard. And I'll just be able to say to myself, like, you were crazy thinking this [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1061.14s)]
*  performance thing is bullshit. Harvard is amazing. And now you're happy. So of course, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1066.5800000000002s)]
*  I didn't feel that way when I got there. And I was, I instantly spun out. I started, you know, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1071.0600000000002s)]
*  getting drunk and doing coke and ecstasy and just running away from the reality that I [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1079.14s)]
*  still had no idea who I was. I still didn't feel like I had an authentic self. I still felt trapped [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1086.42s)]
*  in this performance game. So now what do I do? Because I'd been hoping Harvard would [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1091.7800000000002s)]
*  save me and it hasn't. And that pain- Well, you just won like the number one [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1097.6200000000001s)]
*  merit badge in the world too. You could end up, plus you're playing at the highest level in sports. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1102.26s)]
*  Yeah, I was playing on the squash team. I had on paper, I'd made it. I'd arrived, you know, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1106.9s)]
*  the pinnacle of what you strive for as a young person within the kind of elite education industry. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1114.74s)]
*  Like I won the jackpot. And yet, I wanted to kill myself basically every day and saw no point to [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1119.3000000000002s)]
*  any of it. And so as I spun out with each, you know, through the fall, week after week after week, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1126.02s)]
*  and I really lost my- any footing I might've had, I just lost it all. And I was just a mess [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1133.62s)]
*  and getting myself into all kinds of dangerous, impulsive, you know, really dark situations. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1140.34s)]
*  I eventually by winter time was just so desperate for relief from this pain that that little voice [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1148.1799999999998s)]
*  of that psychiatrist all those years earlier is saying, oh, you have this illness called bipolar [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1154.5s)]
*  disorder. I was like, maybe she's right. Like, why do I feel this way? Why can't I get my shit [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1160.26s)]
*  together? Why am I such a mess? Maybe I really am sick. And so it was at that point that I [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1164.58s)]
*  willingly, voluntarily went back to psychiatry. I found a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1172.42s)]
*  which of course, you know, is considered the kind of the gold, the golden psychiatric institution, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1179.78s)]
*  one of the oldest in the country. This, this most famous, most famous. Yep. Sylvia Plath and Sexton, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1186.1s)]
*  exactly. Ray Charles, Robert Loh. Oh yeah. They all wrote poems and fiction about their experiences [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1192.1799999999998s)]
*  there. And so here I was now so privileged and blessed to be entering this hallowed psychiatric [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1198.34s)]
*  ground. I was just so excited. Did it work for Sylvia Plath or Robert Loh? I mean, we all know, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1206.58s)]
*  but like. And a lot of people say that, you know, from what I recall and someone should, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1214.58s)]
*  you know, confirm my facts, but from what I remember years ago reading about Sylvia, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1221.86s)]
*  I guess she eventually ended up getting electroshock, which by the way is still alive [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1228.6599999999999s)]
*  and well. A hundred thousand people a year get electroshock in the US. McLean Hospital [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1233.6999999999998s)]
*  on its website a couple of years ago was like bragging about how great its ECT center is. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1238.98s)]
*  I think Sylvia, you know, what ECT did to her brain and her creativity, I've heard that that [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1245.06s)]
*  played a part in why she eventually just couldn't be alive anymore because of the adverse effects of [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1255.46s)]
*  psychiatric treatment. So I knew none of this then. I was just desperate for relief. And I think that [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1261.46s)]
*  desperation is a really important piece of this broader conversation because as human beings, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1267.06s)]
*  we can only withstand so much suffering before we need help. We need relief. And that desperation [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1274.1s)]
*  drives you to just accept whatever promises is offered to you because you just, you're too tired [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1281.1399999999999s)]
*  of trying anymore yourself. Just someone take over here. Someone fix me. Someone take this pain away. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1288.26s)]
*  And that's the place that I got to that freshman year. And I think because of that, it impaired [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1293.54s)]
*  any critical thinking capacities that I might have otherwise had to ask those questions of like, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1301.38s)]
*  how do you know I have an incurable brain disease? Or can you tell a little bit more [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1307.7s)]
*  about the evidence base for this drug you're putting me on? None of those questions occurred [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1312.98s)]
*  to me because I didn't care. I didn't care about any of it. I just wanted the pain to stop. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1317.46s)]
*  I get it. Yes. Imagine if there was a file containing your name, your credit, score, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1321.22s)]
*  location, medical history, even your online behavior. You probably wouldn't want other [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1325.22s)]
*  people to see that because it's not their business. Not because you're doing anything wrong, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1330.02s)]
*  but because that's your information and privacy matters. Unfortunately, none of that is private. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1333.62s)]
*  Data brokers are collecting those records and selling them to the highest bidders. It's a [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1340.26s)]
*  total invasion of privacy. It's a crime, but it's not technically a crime. Unfortunately, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1344.74s)]
*  it happens constantly. And that's why we use ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN reroutes 100% of your [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1349.1399999999999s)]

*  Kind of, I mean, I, I skipped a lot of classes freshman year. I was sick a lot and so I missed [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1400.6599999999999s)]
*  a lot of practices that first year. I definitely fell off the, you know, upper echelons of [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1406.1s)]
*  performance that I'd, that I'd been used to leading up to then, which I think also was part of why [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1413.1399999999999s)]
*  I was just so desperate. When did they start putting you on drugs at McLean? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1419.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. Right. In that first appointment with my new doctor. And I was put, well, I had actually [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1424.6599999999999s)]
*  been put on psych drugs a week or two prior to that meeting my new psychiatrist at McLean [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1431.46s)]
*  because I had come out as a debutante and a couple of debutante balls on around Christmas time, which [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1438.3400000000001s)]
*  the good Wasp girl that I was like, wasn't an option to not, to not do. And I had actually [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1445.14s)]
*  on winter vacation, you know, in this literal wedding dress, this fancy white wedding dress, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1451.78s)]
*  there I was up on stage, like coked out of my mind, completely trashed. Cause that was, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1457.94s)]
*  I had to be to survive doing such a thing. Also to be fair, everybody is at those things. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1462.5s)]
*  Basically. Sorry, excuse me. And you know, in my long white gloves and I'm up on stage and I'm like, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1467.38s)]
*  I'm literally a robot performing. I just, that was my breaking point on, on Christmas vacation, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1473.94s)]
*  where I just was like, I either need to kill myself right now or get help. And so, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1481.7s)]
*  so that, that was, I went to my parents, I said, please help me. I hadn't asked for it for this [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1486.98s)]
*  kind of help from them in years because of how betrayed I had felt by them sending me to the [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1491.94s)]
*  therapist years earlier, but now I was at a breaking point. And so that was, I was put on a couple meds [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1497.38s)]
*  on vacation. And then when I went back to school and started seeing the psychiatrist at McLean, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1505.46s)]
*  he continued me on those and he began to add new ones. And that began what ended up being a decade [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1510.82s)]
*  of just the polypharmacy highway, you could say. And I became basically a professional psychiatric [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1518.26s)]
*  patient. So what did they put you on? So I was, from the beginning, I was always on an antidepressant [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1526.26s)]
*  of some kind, a mood stabilizer. And then with the passage of time, antipsychotics were added in, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1533.86s)]
*  benzos were added in. I was on Ambien for a long time too, but it was, it was the kind of typical [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1542.42s)]
*  bipolar regimen, as they call it, where it's literally a handful of different prescriptions. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1551.46s)]
*  And the way it was explained to me, it almost felt like, I had this impression that my psychiatrist [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1557.38s)]
*  was very skilled and sophisticated. Oh, this for a little, a little bit of this for that issue, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1566.8200000000002s)]
*  a little bit of this for that issue. The more meds I was on, the more cared for I felt. And it [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1571.8600000000001s)]
*  felt like the more serious, my doctor was taking me. And it just steadily, beginning that freshman [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1580.66s)]
*  year at Harvard on, I just, the more treatment I got and the more compliant I was and the more [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1588.26s)]
*  deferential I was to psychiatric authority, the more my life fell apart. So you said you got meds [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1598.8200000000002s)]
*  in your first appointment. Did anyone ever say to you, you know, you obviously feel deeply unsettled [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1606.1s)]
*  and unhappy at times suicidal. Maybe you're not living the right way. Maybe you shouldn't be at [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1614.82s)]
*  Harvard. Maybe you shouldn't be on the varsity squash team. Maybe you should be, I don't know, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1620.8999999999999s)]
*  tending to horses on a farm or painting or working in a bank or I don't know, doing something else. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1625.2199999999998s)]
*  I don't know. Like, it does seem just intuitive that if someone has pain, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1630.02s)]
*  it's worth thinking about the cause of the pain. If I put my hand on a stove and it hurts, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1636.58s)]
*  I don't take meds for that. I'm like, take my hand off the freaking stove. Did anyone ever address it [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1641.54s)]
*  in that way? Well, they can't really because this is the the bind of this medical model that the [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1646.34s)]
*  mental health industry is built on. So you're told you have a mental illness, quote, unquote, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1654.58s)]
*  and that it's in your brain that there's some kind of usually it's the chemical imbalance story, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1659.38s)]
*  which I just want to ask you to stop chemical imbalance. So this is a phrase that I first [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1666.1000000000001s)]
*  heard maybe 30 years ago when I the first person I knew started taking an SSRI prozac nation was [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1671.94s)]
*  with Wurzel. It was this whole like Time magazine promoted idea that depression, mental illness of [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1678.66s)]
*  all kinds was caused by a quote chemical imbalance in the brain. And the question I always had is, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1685.22s)]
*  okay, if something's an imbalance, what's balance? Is there a baseline? Is there a way to measure [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1690.02s)]
*  various chemicals in your brain? Do we know what the right levels of those chemicals is? I mean, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1695.94s)]
*  I don't under think is there any science behind that at all? No. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1703.62s)]
*  It's a chemical imbalance in your brain. Okay. Where should so like if I'm low on oil, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1711.54s)]
*  I throw the dipstick at the exact top of the engine, I'm like, oh, shit, it's two, you know, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1716.9s)]
*  two inches down, I got to pour another hoard in. Is there anything like that? No psychiatric. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1720.74s)]
*  No, nothing. And you you are one of the lucky few who somehow miraculously saw right through it, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1727.94s)]
*  because most people to this day, despite the fact that the chemical imbalance theory has long been [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1737.7s)]
*  debunked, and there was an umbrella review published in Molecular Psychiatry two years ago [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1743.54s)]
*  that just kind of put the final nail in the coffin on it. It has been, it has never been [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1748.8999999999999s)]
*  proven. And that's been known all along. And yet if you survey American and surveys that have been [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1758.1s)]
*  done of Americans, most people believe that mental illness, you know, that depression, all these [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1763.78s)]
*  things are caused by chemical imbalances to this day. So, but that's like, that's like, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1768.74s)]
*  utterly fake, utterly fake, because we can't define balance. Therefore, we can't define imbalance. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1774.34s)]
*  Exactly. And even if, you know, this, the this is this medicalized framework that we use to think [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1781.3s)]
*  about ourselves, you know, which has such a monopoly on how we make sense of what it means [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1790.34s)]
*  to be human now. I mean, suffering, anxiety, a madness of all kinds. I mean, you're most people [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1794.9s)]
*  view that as illness, quote unquote, like that medical framework is so ubiquitous. And what it [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1803.8600000000001s)]
*  what it does to return to your question about like, did anyone ever ask me about the circumstances [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1810.1000000000001s)]
*  of my life? Like you, you can't because because you either have this unfortunate bad luck with [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1815.14s)]
*  your brain chemistry, and you're just, oh, it's too bad, you you had the bad, you know, genetic [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1823.22s)]
*  card, and you have this chemical imbalance, or your struggle is a response to your life. It can't [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1828.1000000000001s)]
*  be both you can't have this unfortunate disease, and also be having a meaningful response to your [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1835.46s)]
*  circumstances. It's like it's one or the other. And so the, the experiences that I had in the [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1841.7s)]
*  decade and a half that I was a psych patient, and I think the experiences of so many of the [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1848.18s)]
*  more than 60 million adults who are on these drugs right now, and more than 6 million children, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1854.98s)]
*  is that- Wait, there's 60 million American adults and 6 million 66 million Americans total on these [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1861.54s)]
*  drugs? According to the CDC in 2022. So those numbers could well be higher by now. That's [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1868.3400000000001s)]
*  craziness. Yeah, and we are told that that we're having a mental health crisis because [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1873.6200000000001s)]
*  so many rates of suicide are through the roof, anxiety disorder diagnoses, young people struggling, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1880.3400000000001s)]
*  young girls struggling. We're told, you know, this is this terrible crisis, and most people think, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1886.3400000000001s)]
*  oh, we must not be getting enough mental health treatment. But no, if you look at the numbers, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1892.1000000000001s)]
*  you're like, basically everyone is almost, you know, this huge percentage of our population, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1896.42s)]
*  more than ever before, is getting mental health treatment. So the problem isn't [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1902.9s)]
*  not enough mental health treatment. The problem perhaps is, is the mental health. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1906.02s)]
*  So I'm just, I can't, I'm fixated on this. And to continue the metaphor, want to beat it to death. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1910.8200000000002s)]
*  If you come in with a burnt hand, and I don't ask you how you burned it, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1916.3400000000001s)]
*  you're not really treating it. I'm just giving like a pallet. If I give you a painkiller, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1921.0600000000002s)]
*  because you've got a burn on your hand. But if I never say, how'd you burn your hand? Well, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1925.6200000000001s)]
*  I put it on the stove. I do it every morning. So I think a clinician who cared about the [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1928.26s)]
*  patient would say, how about don't put your hand on the stove? Like there was no effort [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1932.82s)]
*  to understand why you felt bad about your life. I mean, there in, in, in therapy, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1936.98s)]
*  I would of course talk about my life and the circumstances of my life, but it was all [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1942.34s)]
*  the baseline operating assumption was that I was just, I had this brain disease [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1947.78s)]
*  that I was at the mercy of that the only thing I could do to manage, you know, to manage it was [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1952.58s)]
*  take pills. And so any conversations that I had with therapists about my life, to me, and I think [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1956.82s)]
*  to a lot of them just felt kind of secondary, like, oh, you know, you're having, you have a [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1964.34s)]
*  lot of stress or you're in this dysfunctional relationship or this kind of hard thing happened [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1969.46s)]
*  to you. We would talk about those things, but not because we thought that was working through [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1975.22s)]
*  those would be what helped me resolve my, my challenges. It was the meds that were going to [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1982.98s)]
*  do that. That was, you know, what I was, what I learned to believe. And I, and I think that's the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1987.6200000000001s)]
*  insidious, that's the insidious nature of this medicalized paradigm is that it basically teaches [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1993.38s)]
*  you to let go of any sense of responsibility or agency over your life because you're just at the [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=1999.78s)]
*  mercy of faulty brain chemistry. And so like, what's the point in trying to change the [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2007.94s)]
*  circumstances of my life because I'm still going to have this brain disease. So like, why does it [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2011.7s)]
*  really matter? They can't define his origin. They don't even ask about a brain disease. That's like [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2016.18s)]
*  in no scientific sense of disease. Literally. Is it contagious? Wow. That's, wow. That's even [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2024.3400000000001s)]
*  crazier than I'm speaking of crazy. That's even crazier than I realized. Yeah. So, okay. So can we [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2032.5s)]
*  just go, if you don't mind, please. Yeah. Since there are 66 million Americans taking these drugs, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2036.98s)]
*  can you just go through and order what those drugs are generally and what the effects on a person are? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2041.14s)]
*  So the different drug classes are antidepressants, of course. So you have the, you know, Prozac, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2048.1800000000003s)]
*  Effexor, Cymbalta, Celexa, Lexapro, the mood stabilizers, which many, many of which are [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2055.1400000000003s)]
*  actually anticonvulsants used for epilepsy. But they've over, you know, over the decades, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2061.78s)]
*  when they were studying them, they noticed that the, you know, the animals became kind of apathetic [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2067.7s)]
*  when they were testing them for these other conditions. They're like, oh, maybe we can [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2074.58s)]
*  use this on psychiatric patients. So most mood stabilizers are actually anticonvulsants. So those [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2078.82s)]
*  would be, you know, Lamyctal, Depakote, Lithium is classed as a mood stabilizer. It's literally [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2085.78s)]
*  a neurotoxin that, you know, it was banned in the United States until the early 70s. It didn't get [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2092.74s)]
*  approved until the early 70s for psychiatric uses and had been banned prior. So that's the other, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2101.8599999999997s)]
*  you know, that's considered the so-called gold standard mood stabilizer. And I could talk a lot [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2109.06s)]
*  about lithium. I have a whole chapter on it in my book because of all the drugs that I was on. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2113.62s)]
*  Lithium salts, it used to be called, I think. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2118.82s)]
*  That's one of the ways it's been described. That's an old, old drug. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2123.1400000000003s)]
*  It's been around for a long time and it started to be used for psychiatric purposes first in [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2127.86s)]
*  Australia and I can't, in the first half of the 20th century. That's what I mean. Yeah, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2134.34s)]
*  it's been on a long time. Yeah. And if you actually, I do a deep dive in the chapter on it in [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2139.5400000000004s)]
*  my book because the story to this very day that most people are given about lithium is that it is [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2148.02s)]
*  the most, you know, it's been around the longest. It has this really reliable evidence base because [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2154.1s)]
*  of how long it's been in use for. It's a gold standard. If you actually look at the studies that [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2159.54s)]
*  got it approved decades ago, I mean, they are the most shoddy, unscientific, completely [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2167.3s)]
*  flimsy, subjective studies that you could possibly imagine. You're just shocked. And this is a case [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2175.78s)]
*  for every single psychiatric drug that is currently on the market. If you actually look at the drug [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2184.42s)]
*  label on the FDA website, so don't take my word for it, go to the FDA website, look up any [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2189.94s)]
*  psychiatric drug, go to the clinical studies section to see what trials the approval was based [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2196.82s)]
*  on. Usually it's maybe two studies and of course they can do as many studies as they want and they [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2205.2200000000003s)]
*  just throw out the ones that they don't like the outcomes of. Guess how long your average psychiatric [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2211.3s)]
*  drug trial lasts to determine safety and efficacy? I don't know, 10 years? Six to eight weeks. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2217.54s)]
*  Wow. Some of them last a week. Some of them last a day. Maybe two studies. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2224.1s)]
*  So these are not longitudinal as we say. There is zero evidence base for long-term safety and [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2231.06s)]
*  efficacy of these drugs, zero. And there is also zero evidence base for polypharmacy. These drugs [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2237.3s)]
*  have never been studied in combination with each other and yet most of us go on to take multiple [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2243.38s)]
*  of them for years. Nor is the mechanism of their effectiveness understood, right? So you said, for [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2249.3s)]
*  example, mood stabilizers were used on animals to stop convulsions and they noticed that the animals [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2255.86s)]
*  became compliant. But that doesn't mean that they know how that drug acts on the brain, correct? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2264.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, usually you'll see a line like that in the drug, like the mechanism of action is not yet [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2269.94s)]
*  understood. And it's, I mean, it is such a... This is so reckless. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2275.38s)]
*  It's, we are all guinea pigs in a massive experiment here and this unfortunately is the case [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2279.46s)]
*  outside of the psychiatric drug context too. Oh, I'm aware. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2285.1400000000003s)]
*  And, you know, when you think about the hubris and the, you know, we know so little about [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2288.5s)]
*  the human brain already as it is. It's so mysterious to us how it works. And to think that, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2298.02s)]
*  you know, we're just, we're going to put in this psychoactive, this synthetic psychoactive chemical, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2304.9s)]
*  we're going to put it into your body. It's going to course through your bloodstream potentially for [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2310.98s)]
*  the rest of your life to be so disregarding of what the long-term consequences of that might be. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2315.94s)]
*  It's one of the most horrible crises of our time, I think. Because to return to your question, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2323.7s)]
*  you know, besides the antidepressants and the mood stabilizers, there are the antipsychotics, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2332.18s)]
*  you know, risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Giodon. There are the antidepressants and the mood [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2337.14s)]
*  stabilizers, there are the antipsychotics, you know, Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Giodon. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2344.82s)]
*  There are, of course, the anti-anxiety drugs, the benzodiazepines, Clonopin, Valium, Ativan, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2351.7s)]
*  and there are the stimulants, the so-called ADHD drugs like Ritalin, Adderall, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2358.58s)]
*  and then the sleep aids like Ambien and Lunesta. So those are the, all the, that's the family, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2364.82s)]
*  the psychiatric drug family. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2371.7s)]
*  Can we go, okay, so can we start at the beginning if you don't mind? So the antidepressants, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2373.14s)]
*  antidepressants. So that would include SSRIs, correct? Okay. So you were put on that immediately. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2379.22s)]
*  What is the effect of that on you? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2385.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, it's such a tricky, it's such a complicated question to answer because [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2388.18s)]
*  in hindsight, I can see all the effects. But at the time when I was on them, I didn't notice [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2393.7s)]
*  the effects. I didn't, it was so, it was subtle, it was in some cases gradual. So when I look back [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2399.94s)]
*  now at how my life, the different path that psychiatric drugs set me down, I can see that [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2407.22s)]
*  they, they, you know, they altered my body physically. So, and not just antidepressants. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2415.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't answer what antidepressants specifically did. So for me, what the drugs did [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2423.2999999999997s)]
*  generally, whichever ones did what, I couldn't say, but they interfered with my basic bodily [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2430.18s)]
*  functions. So I pretty quickly began to have digestive issues. You know, you don't get told [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2437.46s)]
*  that it's like 90 to 95% of your serotonin receptors are in your gut. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2443.94s)]
*  Picture the house of your dreams. Maybe it's got an outdoor pool, a huge front porch, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2448.98s)]
*  an inviting fireplace for a cold winter's night. No matter what you prefer, there's little doubt [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2453.7s)]
*  that an American flag waving out front enhances the whole thing. What better way to welcome your [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2459.06s)]
*  guests than with a flag outside your home. But wait, there's a problem. The American flags you're [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2465.54s)]
*  likely to buy at some big stores were made in China. An American flag made in China. Come on. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2470.74s)]
*  Pure Talk, America's wireless company believes every American deserves an American flag that [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2476.74s)]
*  was made in America. And that's why they're determined to give an allegiance flag, the [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2481.7s)]
*  highest quality American flag to a thousand veterans in time for summer. Pure Talk is using [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2486.02s)]
*  a portion of this month's sales to honor Flag Day and provide these American flags to American [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2491.78s)]
*  veterans with plans from just 25 bucks a month for limited talk, text, plenty of data. You can [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2496.98s)]
*  enjoy America's most dependable 5G network while cutting your cell phone bill in half for real. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2503.54s)]
*  Go to pure talk.com slash talker to support veterans and to switch to America's company [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2508.82s)]
*  Wireless from Pure Talk. So the point of these drugs is to regulate or affect or disrupt but change [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2514.82s)]
*  your serotonin levels. That's the crude way that we understand them so far. So they obviously act [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2522.98s)]
*  so an SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. So it's named as a serotonergic drug so that it [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2533.54s)]
*  primarily acts on the serotonin system. It acts on many other systems too because it's all [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2542.7400000000002s)]
*  interconnected. The human body cannot be compartmentalized. But the serotonin system, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2547.54s)]
*  besides being largely responsible for how your gut functions, it also muscle function. I mean, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2553.06s)]
*  they're like basic primal, if I'm remembering correctly, I think it's the serotonin system that [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2562.02s)]
*  regulates temperature, vomiting reflex. It's really primal. It's not just about happy chemicals. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2568.2599999999998s)]
*  And so when you're taking an SSRI or an SNRI, any of these serotonergic drugs, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2580.1s)]
*  it's not just acting on the brain, it's acting on the whole body. And so a lot of people, myself [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2588.74s)]
*  included, will get diagnoses of irritable bowel syndrome or they'll have other kinds of digestive [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2593.94s)]
*  issues while they're on these drugs. Sometimes it starts quickly, sometimes it takes a while, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2601.14s)]
*  but it doesn't occur to you because we're not programmed to question medical treatments generally, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2606.82s)]
*  at least I wasn't. And so as my physical issues accumulated, I just assumed I was just, you know, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2618.58s)]
*  I'm because I'm so mentally ill, I'm not taking good care of myself. I'm eating shitty food. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2625.7s)]
*  You know, I, I was your fault. Exactly. Exactly. And besides digestive issues, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2630.9s)]
*  you know, the antipsychotics and mood stabilizers cause serious weight gain. My weight fluctuated [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2638.02s)]
*  70 pounds during my mental patient career. I can, I mean, it's just, I literally looked like a [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2645.38s)]
*  different person. I should have brought an old picture of me. I mean, you wouldn't have recognized [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2653.7000000000003s)]
*  me during my peak psych patient era. They caused, you know, I had chronic aches and pains and my, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2657.7000000000003s)]
*  my, you know, I had skin issues and my nails would flake off, my hair would fall out, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2666.9s)]
*  all those, all these subtle changes that happened, that just grew over time. I never [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2673.1400000000003s)]
*  linked it to the, to the drugs. And then, and then in terms of their effects on me, you know, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2680.42s)]
*  emotionally and mentally, a lot of people talk about antidepressants, especially as [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2687.6200000000003s)]
*  having a numbing effect and, and, and which by the way can be helpful. I mean, it's important to make [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2694.82s)]
*  clear here. My orientation to this is not anti-psych drug. I think, you know, we've been [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2701.06s)]
*  altering ourselves as human beings since the dawn of time with psychoactive substances, you know, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2707.7799999999997s)]
*  who am I to tell someone, you know, you're, you shouldn't take a psych drug. For me, it's about [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2713.7s)]
*  the stories that were told about what they are and what they do. And if you're being told, you know, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2719.46s)]
*  you have a chemical imbalance, Tucker, that's why you feel down in the dumps. Here's some Prozac, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2726.34s)]
*  it's going to help adjust the chemicals, which will help you feel happier. Like that's a lie. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2731.7000000000003s)]
*  And you agreeing to take the pill is not a choice. You are not making, you are, you have been coerced [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2736.58s)]
*  into taking this drug through basically propaganda. But if you're told, you know, Tucker, we really [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2742.02s)]
*  don't know that much about what these drugs do. They're based, they're approved on the basis of [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2748.58s)]
*  very short term trials. Long term outcomes are quite poor. If you actually look at the data that [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2754.18s)]
*  does exist, your serotonin system, you know, controls a lot of really important functions. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2760.8999999999996s)]
*  You know, if you walk them through, if you are walked through all of that, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2767.7s)]
*  and then you still decide, you know what, I kind of want to numb myself out right now. Like I can't, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2772.1s)]
*  I don't have support system. I'm too stressed. I have too much on my plate. Like I am aware of [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2777.46s)]
*  the risks. I still want to take this and, and you know, I know it's not fixing a pathology in me. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2782.5s)]
*  Then I'm like, oh, for it, like good for you. That's informed consent is what you're describing. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2789.62s)]
*  Exactly. And that is not, if you're being told this is an antidepressant medication, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2793.94s)]
*  you're not making an informed choice because that is marketing language. This is not a drug [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2799.7s)]
*  that's acting against depression, like targeting, oh, let's get in there. And there's where the [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2804.58s)]
*  depression lives and now we're going to target it. That's bullshit. So the language itself [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2809.46s)]
*  makes or breaks whether you can make a true choice. And so until we change how we talk about these [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2815.86s)]
*  drugs, I don't think anyone is making a truly informed choice. So my sense of SSRIs is that in [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2820.9s)]
*  some people they offer relief, which is not always good. I felt that way by vodka, you know, and it [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2828.18s)]
*  turns out it was causing a lot of problems that I thought it was solving. I think anyone who drank [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2834.82s)]
*  too much has a similar experience, but drugs are similar, but it does offer at least in the short [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2838.74s)]
*  term, like, oh, I feel less crazy. Like I'm calmer now. Does it? I think it can, especially [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2844.2599999999998s)]
*  short-term use. I mean, for example, if you are someone who hates to fly in airplanes and you get [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2850.2599999999998s)]
*  panicky, like you take a Xanax, that's going to help you a lot or might help you a lot. And so [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2854.74s)]
*  when used in acute situations or for a short period of time, I do think they can feel really [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2861.2999999999997s)]
*  helpful to many people. I think a lot of this is around the long-term use of them, which they were [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2870.8199999999997s)]
*  never designed for. Well, so, but that's, I mean, that's a marker for addiction. Anything that, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2878.34s)]
*  and that's why smoking is, cigarette smoking is so compelling, crack smoking is so compelling, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2884.42s)]
*  because anything you pull into your lungs immediately goes to your bloodstream. It has [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2888.5s)]
*  an immediate effect and every study shows the faster the effect, the more profound the relief, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2893.06s)]
*  the more addictive it is. And that's one of the reasons benzos are so terrifying. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2898.58s)]
*  But, but I guess my question is like, does it, you get the feeling that people on some of the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2903.22s)]
*  antidepressants, the SSRIs like seem kind of like dead inside. Did you feel that? I totally did, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2910.66s)]
*  but I attributed it to how sick I was. I felt dead. I felt disconnected. I felt, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2917.54s)]
*  I felt like I was trapped in this kind of sludgy morass of, that was separating me from the world [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2926.98s)]
*  around me. I just, and I really truly believed that that was me and my own faulty biology. And so [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2937.3s)]
*  it's so insidious. Like you, I think it's, it's a psychiatrist named Peter Bragan, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2947.86s)]
*  calls it medication spell binding, which I think is a really compelling phrase because [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2955.22s)]
*  the very parts of you that are required to step back and think critically about what's happening [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2960.34s)]
*  to you are impaired by the drugs. And so you're in this, for me, like decade and a half, almost [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2966.34s)]
*  like intoxication state. And then you're getting all these messages from all these well-meaning [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2973.3s)]
*  therapists and psychiatrists saying, oh, you're not feeling helped. Oh, you're feeling worse. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2978.34s)]
*  Well, your sickness is progressing. Like, let's try this new drug or let's up your dose or let's [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2982.9s)]
*  switch you to that. It's never like, let's all just pause for a moment here and step back and [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2987.78s)]
*  wonder if maybe this whole thing is, is wrong. And you don't need any of this. No one is doing [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=2993.46s)]
*  that. Of course. And so as I went deeper into psychiatric patient hood and those physical [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3000.1s)]
*  issues worsened, my cognitive function worsened, you know, memory pro. Oh my gosh. When you were, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3006.9s)]
*  I mean, I don't know which drugs were the biggest culprits, probably the Benzos and the [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3014.1s)]
*  anti-psychotics, but my capacity to remember things, to read, to absorb information and [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3018.2599999999998s)]
*  actually comprehend information, I just dissipated over the years. And which was [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3025.06s)]
*  really hard for me as someone who had, you know, so much of my sense of self, however fake it felt, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3032.34s)]
*  was rooted in my intellect. And so here I was just feeling like this mushy, you know, just [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3038.66s)]
*  totally incapacitated mind that couldn't engage with the world anymore. And let alone like feel [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3047.38s)]
*  creative and curious. And I was just, I was just like a zombie basically. Killing your life force, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3056.74s)]
*  it sounds like. It totally was. And that idea of a life force, like to me, this whole thing [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3062.66s)]
*  at the heart of this crisis that we are in, because it is a crisis, it's just not a mental [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3070.42s)]
*  health crisis, it's a crisis of psychiatric iatrogenesis is what I call it. The word [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3075.38s)]
*  iatrogenic means treatment induced or doctor induced harm. I believe that this huge, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3081.06s)]
*  these huge numbers of people who are in so much pain, a huge driving force of it is the fact that [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3087.78s)]
*  this entire paradigm is actually leading to more suffering. And it does. And more violence. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3095.54s)]
*  More violence, more disconnect, more polarization. When you're under the influence of these drugs for [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3102.18s)]
*  years and years and years, like you said, you do, I won't speak for everyone, I'll speak for myself [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3107.7s)]
*  and the thousands of fellows whom I have known over all these years. You lose touch with your [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3114.1s)]
*  human spirit, with you know, your sense of aliveness in the world, your ability to feel [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3120.98s)]
*  connected to the sunlight on your cheek, to the, you know, the sweet child on the sidewalk, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3127.54s)]
*  to God, to serenity. You lose the ability to feel connected to any of that and you're thinking the [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3135.38s)]
*  whole time it's you and you're just getting sicker. And when you scale that out and think [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3143.14s)]
*  about the consequences on our society of that, with so many, especially young people, on these [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3149.94s)]
*  drugs, without even realizing that this is happening to them because of this medication [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3157.06s)]
*  spellbinding phenomenon, I mean, to me it's like no wonder our country is more polarized than [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3161.86s)]
*  it's ever been. It's obviously much more complicated. I'm not trying to say it's all psych drugs, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3169.22s)]
*  but I think it's a big piece here of why we're all so disconnected. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3173.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's, I mean, the main takeaway just listening to this is that it changes something [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3178.58s)]
*  essential about people. This is not on the margins. This is like the deepest thing in you [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3183.22s)]
*  changes. So the measure, if you think the measure of happiness is your relationships, which I think [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3188.98s)]
*  is fair, how were your relationships? Oh my gosh. I mean, I chuckle because I'm like, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3194.66s)]
*  first of all, I'm like, well, what relationships really? But then of course I did have, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3203.2999999999997s)]
*  I had boyfriends, I had people I would socialize with, but it was all by the time I graduated, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3208.34s)]
*  which I had to take a year off at Harvard because I was so suicidal. I had my first [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3219.86s)]
*  admission to a psych ward while I was at Harvard. The fact that I made it through to this day, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3224.18s)]
*  I don't really remember anything I learned there. I just was so foggy from it all. But [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3230.1s)]
*  by the time I left, I had no friends. I had a tendency to be in, I was a serial monogamous, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3238.3399999999997s)]
*  you could say, just relationship with a guy and then we'd break up and then I'd get right into [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3245.62s)]
*  another relationship with the guy. And it was just, I dated guys who were as lost as I was. So [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3250.18s)]
*  suffice to say, it didn't look pretty. That was my, when I would sometimes muster the energy to [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3256.02s)]
*  go out and socialize, I'd have to do drugs and get trash because that was the only way that I felt [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3265.2200000000003s)]
*  alive. And of course it was synthetic. And my family, they were, my family hung in there with [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3272.42s)]
*  me through the whole, the whole, that whole thing. But of course they didn't have access to the real [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3280.18s)]
*  me because I was under the influence of all of these drugs. And so they were there for me, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3290.18s)]
*  but I wasn't connected to them emotionally. I would rely on them and I would come home and [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3295.7s)]
*  they would take care of me and provide for me as I, you know, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3303.46s)]
*  bumbled along through my twenties, like a total mess. Like I could barely hold down. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3307.7000000000003s)]
*  They sound like really kind people. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3311.1400000000003s)]
*  They, the patience and the persistence that they all had, you know, my younger sisters and my [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3313.46s)]
*  parents, you know, it was not easy for them and it was not always pretty in our family system. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3322.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, we, our whole family evolved around me as the designated problem, you know, me as [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3327.94s)]
*  a designated patient. So, so understandably that created all kinds of challenges, but they never [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3333.54s)]
*  gave up on me and I would just, I'd come home whenever I couldn't function anymore. And, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3341.62s)]
*  but I didn't feel, I didn't feel connected to them, to myself, to anything. And again, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3348.18s)]
*  I believed it was me. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3355.94s)]
*  Wow, that's so, that's like hell. You're describing hell. Disassociated from everybody, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3357.3799999999997s)]
*  everything and from God. Do you think it's possible to have a relationship with God while on [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3363.22s)]
*  psych meds? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3368.8199999999997s)]
*  It wasn't for me. I mean, I, I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that in a sweeping generalization. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3370.3399999999997s)]
*  But it wasn't for you. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3377.4599999999996s)]
*  It wasn't for me for sure, for sure. And I think the other piece of this that [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3378.4199999999996s)]
*  is so important, especially because of how many of us are psychiatrists as kids, is that I had no, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3382.74s)]
*  I had no sexuality. I had no kind of like erotic life force in me that animates you as an artist, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3391.86s)]
*  as a writer, as a friend, as a appreciator of beauty. I had none of that. And I of course, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3401.86s)]
*  didn't realize what I was missing because I'd been psychiatrized basically at the onset of puberty. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3409.86s)]
*  And when you don't have access to that facet of who you are, it, it makes for a very lonely, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3417.78s)]
*  alienating existence. And you know, I'm so glad that when I got myself out of this mess [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3427.46s)]
*  years later, I regained my sexuality. Because a lot of people, like there's a whole movement now [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3434.66s)]
*  of it's called the there's this condition called PSSD, post SSRI sexual dysfunction. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3442.42s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3448.66s)]
*  There's a whole movement. They're incredibly well organized on X doing really important [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3450.18s)]
*  public awareness work around how many people either never regain sexual function when they [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3455.3799999999997s)]
*  come off. Some people lose it. Some people had it on. And then when they come off the antidepressant, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3461.78s)]
*  they lose it. Some people haven't regained it for years. And so there's dead. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3467.86s)]
*  Yep. Okay, really? And no one's gone to jail for this? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3474.5s)]
*  No, because this is the it's the lack of accountability. And of course, this is [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3481.38s)]
*  the whole pharmaceutical industry, not just psychiatry. It's designed in such a way that no [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3486.98s)]
*  one the most that they're held accountable is, you know, the occasional $3 billion fine [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3492.8199999999997s)]
*  for criminal activities. So I guess we could say but at least the suicide rates going down [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3498.4199999999996s)]
*  and people are happier. I mean, you would think but as, as of 2020, to one person killed him or [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3501.94s)]
*  herself every 11 minutes, I think it was 50,000 people killed themselves. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3511.62s)]
*  So like, that's kind of the bottom line. I don't I don't need to have a medical degree to say [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3515.22s)]
*  that if the number of people the absolute number and the percentage of people taking these drugs [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3521.54s)]
*  rises, and the suicide rate rises, you know, we can argue about cause and effect, but they're not [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3526.66s)]
*  working. I mean, I mean, in what sense are they working if more people are killing themselves? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3532.5s)]
*  And what's wild Tucker? Am I missing something? I don't want to be a Philistine here. I want to [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3537.62s)]
*  be like, sensitive to the science. You're seeing it clear as day. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3541.06s)]
*  Okay. And what's wild is that in these drug labels, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3545.14s)]
*  for many, many years in the adverse effects section, you will see antidepressants have been [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3549.38s)]
*  documented to increase rates or increase suicidal and homicidal ideation even in some of some of [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3555.54s)]
*  the drug labels. So this isn't like, we're just realizing that these drugs can actually make [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3561.14s)]
*  people worse. It's been in the drug labels the whole time. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3567.38s)]
*  Well, I know from firsthand experience, I knew nothing about this. I don't take any of that crap. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3570.42s)]
*  I've always hated shrinks my whole life. Never been. But no one I know who's been to one has [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3574.1800000000003s)]
*  gotten better. So that's why I don't like them. But anyway, these mass shootings and the calls [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3581.1400000000003s)]
*  for gun control and to take my shotguns away and all this stuff got me involved in like, what is [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3585.54s)]
*  causing all these shootings because there are a lot of shootings, right. And in every case you look [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3591.38s)]
*  at the person's just full of psychiatric meds. And so I brought this up a couple of times in [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3596.34s)]
*  public and whoa, you get attacked for even raising the question. Like, is there a connection between [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3604.1800000000003s)]
*  SSRIs and mass shootings? Why is that a crazy question? Even the question and people. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3610.42s)]
*  What is that? It's, it's, it's, you would think that [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3614.34s)]
*  people would of course want to have that question asked and answered. And if they had [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3619.94s)]
*  if they had true faith in their products, they would be like, let's look at it. Let's be transparent [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3626.6600000000003s)]
*  about this. Let's, let's have open access to the data. Let's do whatever we need to do to show you [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3632.34s)]

*  you know, and I know, I know a friend of mine who's a professor at one point tried to FOIA [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3645.3s)]
*  the medical records of various mass shooters and, and couldn't get access. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3653.3s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. Yeah. And, and you know, it's, I don't, I can't remember when, um, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3660.1800000000003s)]
*  Columbine, was it like 98 or it was 97. I think some, and, and as you said, the 90s were, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3667.54s)]
*  so Prozac came to market in the late 80s. The 90s were declared the decade of the brain [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3674.98s)]
*  by our us government. And, and the 90s began the, the, basically the, the ubiquitization of, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3680.5s)]
*  of psychiatric drugs, the normalization of them, the, the kind of infusion of them into [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3688.34s)]
*  every facet of our lives. And, and this of course was fueled by industry funding. So all the kind of [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3692.82s)]
*  anti-stigma mental health awareness campaigns that you now, you know, mental health awareness month [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3699.62s)]
*  were in May, actually Tucker, we're in May, May is mental health awareness month. Um, these are [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3705.06s)]
*  all industry funded efforts to basically, um, infuse the cultural discourse around emotional [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3709.86s)]
*  pain with, with this message that, with this actually very just righteous message that you [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3717.54s)]
*  should never feel alone with your suffering. You should feel like you can talk about your troubles. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3723.54s)]
*  That, that is a really important message that, but that has been exploited by powerful corporations [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3728.6600000000003s)]
*  to basically now mean there's no shame in getting mental health treatment. And so they've taken this [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3736.9s)]
*  important message and, and perverted it to basically link anyone who is calling into question [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3744.1800000000003s)]
*  psychiatric drugs with someone who doesn't care about suffering. I mean, it's amazing that the, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3752.26s)]
*  the number of times that I, I share my story and I'm literally just talking about my story, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3757.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying anything about anyone else. You know, the, my, the story of how I eventually [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3763.54s)]
*  left this all behind. People hear that as me denying the reality of suffering. I mean, you're, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3768.9s)]
*  you're, you know, this woman doesn't think people are struggling out there. I'm like, where did I [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3775.94s)]
*  ever say that? It's actually the opposite. I think there's, I am, first of all, I struggle [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3780.18s)]
*  a lot in my life. You know, I, I'm by no means a happy, put together mentally healthy person [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3787.46s)]
*  all the time, but how are you conflating me questioning the psychiatric drug paradigm with me [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3793.2999999999997s)]
*  questioning the reality of people suffering? Like it's, if you think about it, it's just, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3799.7s)]
*  these industries have been so effective in conflating care with treatment. So if you [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3805.54s)]
*  question treatment, people assume you're questioning the need that people have for help. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3812.66s)]
*  It's like there are other ways to get help people. You probably have a lot going on in your life, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3817.62s)]
*  meaning you don't want to waste a lot of time thinking about life insurance, though, you know, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3822.2599999999998s)]

*  listed and illicit, that the mental health crisis would basically disappear? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3912.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure it's, you know, it's, it's, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3918.2599999999998s)]
*  People stayed sober. I haven't had any serious mental health problems since I got sober [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3922.66s)]
*  23 years ago. I can speak for myself. Like that's just what I know. And I know a lot of people in [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3929.22s)]
*  that exact position. Once you just like stop addling yourself with crap, you return to [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3934.66s)]
*  equilibrium. I don't know. Yeah. Well, I think, I think you, the way I would think about it for [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3941.62s)]
*  myself at least is that when I let go of this medicalized way of understanding myself, you know, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3946.18s)]
*  translating all my struggles into symptoms to take to a doctor, et cetera, et cetera. And when I came [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3953.2999999999997s)]
*  off the drugs, and when I also then began to educate myself about like the broader issues with [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3958.8999999999996s)]
*  just our whole medical industry and how we compartmentalize the body and all these [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3965.7s)]
*  problematic ways. And so I just kind of reconceptualized how I think about well-being [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3971.54s)]
*  and the things I put in my body or don't put in my body. I, to your point, I definitely have found [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3978.58s)]
*  my way to an equal, a kind of equilibrium that equips me to face life's challenges, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3984.9s)]
*  which are inevitable. I mean, it's, I think it's a part of the human condition to suffer, to struggle, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3991.46s)]
*  to have dark nights of the soul. And I think historically these were episodic experiences [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=3996.66s)]
*  that, that would, you know, some, something hard happened in your life or even something not visible, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4006.5s)]
*  but you just are in a tough chapter. You, you kind of, you just find your way through it. Maybe it [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4014.1s)]
*  takes a week, maybe it takes a month, maybe it takes a year, but you move through it. I think [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4022.26s)]
*  that used to be prior to the rise of this medicalized mental health industry, that used to be the [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4026.9s)]
*  baseline operating assumption. And then since the rise of psychiatric drugs and since the rise of [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4033.5400000000004s)]
*  the chemical imbalance story and this incurable brain disease story, we've just forgotten that [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4040.42s)]
*  the struggles that emerge in life are responses to life and not permanent. If you, if you [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4047.7s)]
*  orient yourself to them in that way and actually, and actually believe and tell yourself like, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4056.2599999999998s)]
*  this is a hard chapter that I'm in, but it's a chapter. It's not my whole story. And that's [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4063.62s)]
*  what I was taught by psychiatry is that my whole story, the rest of the story of my life [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4068.18s)]
*  is that I'm just so-called mentally ill needing treatment. And that's all I have. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4073.46s)]
*  They do with alcohol too. I can just, I can speak from personal experience. Well, you're not, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4078.58s)]
*  I will always be an alcoholic. No, I'm not an alcoholic. I drank too much alcoholic, I guess, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4083.2999999999997s)]
*  but I don't drink anymore. So like, it's not the center of my life anymore. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4087.8599999999997s)]
*  That's so I have, I don't think- [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4091.54s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a fair, look, I'm not judging anybody. I love AA. I don't go, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4092.8999999999996s)]
*  but I love it. I don't want to be judgmental, but like telling people they're weak and pathetic [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4096.74s)]
*  and will always be dependent on you. It's like, it's a red flag for me. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4101.94s)]
*  I'm so with you. I, in my book, I talk about the chapter in my life when I quit drinking, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4106.74s)]
*  which I did eventually do because drinking one to two bottles of wine a night before you [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4111.94s)]
*  take your five med regimen, including like horse tranquilizer doses of clonopin is not a recipe for [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4118.74s)]
*  functioning. And so I did eventually decide to quit drinking and was really active in the 12 step [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4126.9800000000005s)]
*  world for a few years and I hold a soft spot for it in my heart. But I came to the same conclusion [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4133.9400000000005s)]
*  for myself is, you know, I had spent the most formative years of my life letting psychiatry [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4140.18s)]
*  define who I was. And then I moved into the 12 step world and I took on a new label, alcoholic, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4147.38s)]
*  and I began to defer my authority to, you know, a higher power. And I do believe in God and I do, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4157.7s)]
*  I am connected to this kind of like broader oneness of life around me, but [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4165.38s)]
*  I eventually realized that I have to stop turning it over. I have to stop seeking outside [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4173.78s)]
*  guidance, authority, expertise, answers, and I need to start looking within myself and actually [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4180.66s)]
*  take responsibility for my life and my decisions and my relationships. And I realized like I have [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4187.78s)]
*  to stop labeling myself as anything really and kind of buying into any ideology of any kind that [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4197.7s)]
*  tells me I have a problem it has the solution for. Now I'm like, you know, even in the wellness, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4204.18s)]
*  alternative health world, there are a lot of problems that you get sold into thinking you have [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4211.54s)]
*  that their products can help you solve. And I'm at the point where I'm like, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4219.22s)]
*  I don't want to look out there anymore for answers to anything internal to me. That's just me. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4224.98s)]
*  So what was the experience of therapy like? So you're on all these drugs. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4234.42s)]
*  How many drugs were you on? At the peak five. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4239.3s)]
*  That's unbelievable. But concurrently, you're sitting through therapy a lot. How often? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4241.62s)]
*  Twice a week usually. For how long? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4250.34s)]
*  Yeah. An hour each time. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4253.54s)]
*  No, but for how many years? The whole time I was from 18 to 27, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4255.700000000001s)]
*  consistently in therapy. Sometimes I would enroll in programs too. I ended up going to the hospital [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4264.18s)]
*  four times during those years. And then afterwards, when you're discharged from a psych ward, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4274.9800000000005s)]
*  you're enrolled in some kind of like step down program, you know, an intensive outpatient program [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4282.02s)]
*  where every day from nine to five for like a few weeks, you go to the psych hospital and then you [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4288.42s)]
*  go home. And then you downgrade to, you know, a lesser intensive program where you go to a few [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4294.5s)]
*  groups a week. So in my 20s, I was always in individual therapy and then very often in group [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4300.34s)]
*  programs. And that's a lot of therapy. Obviously, I guess I can skip to the end, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4308.42s)]
*  to the punchline, it didn't work because you're hospitalized four times so it's like not working. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4312.18s)]
*  But what, that's nine years of therapy, you know, consistently, full time almost. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4316.42s)]
*  Like, what was that like? What do you talk about? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4322.9s)]
*  Well, that's the, I won't speak for all therapists or the therapy industry as a whole. You know, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4326.74s)]
*  some of my good friends are therapists and they work with people in very different ways than how [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4334.9s)]
*  I was in therapy. So, but in my experience, and I do think in the experience of a lot of people, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4340.099999999999s)]
*  because our society has lost so many, because there's so few spaces where you can turn [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4347.78s)]
*  to other human beings, to neighbors, to friends, to colleagues, to talk about how hard it is [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4359.780000000001s)]
*  to be alive sometimes. Therapy becomes like the one place you have to feel seen and heard [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4366.9800000000005s)]
*  and understood. And so what happened to, for me is that because I had no other place to, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4375.06s)]
*  where I felt like I could be open, I kind of, I developed this like dependence, you could say, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4382.66s)]
*  on my weekly therapy sessions. And this, you know, I just, I kind of came to see my therapist as [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4391.0599999999995s)]
*  really like my substitute friends, sometimes my substitute mother, or something, you know, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4400.18s)]
*  they kind of replaced what would have been authentic relationships had I not grown up in therapy. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4404.98s)]
*  And so, of course, if this is the only place you have to go to talk about your problems, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4411.62s)]
*  you need to have a lot of problems to talk about, because otherwise you don't need to go anymore. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4416.74s)]
*  That's just fascinating what you just said. So you're basically paying people to be in [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4419.94s)]
*  relationship with you, but because you were doing that, and you were steered there, I mean, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4424.34s)]
*  this wasn't like a choice that you initially made, obviously, but because you did that, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4428.5s)]
*  you actually neglected your real relationships. Is that what? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4432.58s)]
*  Exactly. And what's so really nefarious about the whole thing is that you don't only neglect [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4435.7s)]
*  what could have been authentic relationships, you actually, for me at least, I actually came to [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4444.099999999999s)]
*  dismiss the idea of like, just a friendship, like they don't understand mental illness. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4450.58s)]
*  Like I need doctors, you know, how could a friend help me? Like I have a brain disease, you know, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4456.179999999999s)]
*  that's so dark. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4462.58s)]
*  It's like really, I don't know if that happened. I don't know what percentage of psych patients [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4463.3s)]
*  that happens to, but it happened to me and I saw it in, you know, the culture of the psych ward, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4467.94s)]
*  the culture of these, all these programs that I was in. We were the only people we hung out with, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4472.98s)]
*  fellow patients, like we had a whole, you know, you go to lunch together in the hospital cafeteria, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4478.66s)]
*  and like you're at your little patient table in the corner and you're looking at all the [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4484.26s)]
*  psychologists and social workers and doctors walking around with their badges and you're kind [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4488.820000000001s)]
*  of over in the corner like, where are the crazy like fucked up patients over here? Like we're not [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4493.700000000001s)]
*  like them. I mean, there's this whole twisted, almost like romanticized culture of psych [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4497.3s)]
*  patient hood where you're- [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4505.46s)]
*  Heroin addicts are like this too. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4506.34s)]
*  It's so, gosh, I feel grief about it because we truly were like the real world out there. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4508.34s)]
*  They wouldn't get us. Like we're so messed up. Like we can never, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4515.14s)]
*  we don't belong there. Like we belong here on the hospital grounds. It's like, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4519.38s)]
*  I used to feel really proud of like how crazy I was. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4525.38s)]
*  I believe that. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4529.9400000000005s)]
*  It's so, I mean, I chuckle about it now, but I, you know, it's of course I grieve too that that [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4530.740000000001s)]
*  was my source of pride, was what a good successful psych patient I was. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4537.860000000001s)]
*  It's so deep and so sick. You see it with homeless drug addicts. There's a kind of pride. Like [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4544.42s)]
*  there's a tribe. We support each other. We're, you know, we're sharing our [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4550.1s)]
*  misery, but there's a kind of feeling like we're in the elite, you know, we're junkies. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4554.42s)]
*  And it's the same kind of death worship. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4558.74s)]
*  Yeah. And like that word tribal, I mean, because it exploits this like deep, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4562.58s)]
*  primal instinct that we have as tribal beings. It exploits that. Whereas, you know, once [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4568.820000000001s)]
*  in our pre-modern pre-industrialized age, your tribe would have been your village, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4576.26s)]
*  your local community. And of course people in that community, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4580.820000000001s)]
*  individuals would have had crises and struggles, but you all banded together and you had [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4584.42s)]
*  multi-generations of families. So, you know, grandparents had important roles, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4589.3s)]
*  grandchildren. And the home was a place where the man and the woman had a kind of symbiosis and [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4594.740000000001s)]
*  mutual interdependence. And I'm not trying to romanticize the past. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4602.42s)]
*  I literally have a family like that. So that's real. I mean, I live like that. And I think, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4608.1s)]
*  not bragging, but I mean, that's just, that's the way you're supposed to live. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4612.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I think our modern world does make it really hard. I think, you know, this isn't for me [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4616.9s)]
*  about individuals or, you know, particular families being, you know, weak or lazy or bad. I [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4625.9400000000005s)]
*  think just we're in this toxic stew of a culture in which we're, you know, from the food we're, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4634.58s)]
*  so many of us put into our bodies to the screens that we're in front of all day, to the just gross [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4644.58s)]
*  kind of consumerist messaging that's just buffeting us all day. It makes it really hard [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4651.0599999999995s)]
*  to stay in touch with yourself enough to actually have the capacity to [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4657.86s)]
*  grow of, you know, develop your own tribe, whether it's your family or your neighborhood. Like, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4663.3s)]
*  I think it's really important to say, like, this is not about individuals like fucking up. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4669.54s)]
*  This is about our social order having evolved in such a way that it makes it feel like impossible [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4676.0199999999995s)]
*  to have the family that you have for so many people. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4682.74s)]
*  And economics play a role too, I think. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4686.5s)]
*  For sure. For sure. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4688.98s)]
*  So a big role. So, no, I couldn't agree with you more. So I keep stepping on your story. Sorry. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4690.98s)]
*  No, not at all. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4695.54s)]
*  Because it's an amazing story. But the question of like, what do you talk about in therapy for [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4696.74s)]
*  nine years? I'm sorry, I didn't let you answer. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4701.14s)]
*  You know, I talked about whatever poor guy I was in a dysfunctional relationship with. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4703.3s)]
*  I talked about my family and our conflicts. I talked about, you know, how I whatever job I [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4709.78s)]
*  was trying to hold down, which I never could, you know, that how hard it was. And I talked about how [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4716.18s)]
*  suicidal I was. Suicide was like a constant companion of mine through my 20s until I did [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4723.14s)]
*  eventually. Actually, it's an important part of my story to bring up. Like, the therapy, the meds, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4728.740000000001s)]
*  you know, by the time I was 25, all I had was my relationship to the mental health professionals [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4740.42s)]
*  in my life, to the people being paid to be there for me and the pills that I would pick up at the [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4747.62s)]
*  pharmacy every month. That was all I had. And I life had deteriorated to such a degree that [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4753.78s)]
*  I couldn't take care of myself. I couldn't work. I had no friends. And I was told like the message [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4761.3s)]
*  that I received was, you know, unfortunately, your bipolar disorder has progressed to such a degree [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4769.86s)]
*  that you're now treatment resistant. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4776.98s)]
*  Yep. Yep. So you spend millions of dollars on these people take all of their drugs, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4783.78s)]
*  you get worse and they're like, unfortunately, Laurie, you're treatment resistant. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4790.82s)]
*  Literally. Literally. And so, you know, this phrase treatment resistance, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4795.86s)]
*  like the craziest story. But it's a brilliant, it's a brilliant business model because of course, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4802.42s)]
*  you know, if you feel if you feel better after starting psych drug, the credit goes to the drug, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4808.5s)]
*  of course, see, it's helped you. If you don't feel better, or if you feel worse. Yes, it's never the [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4814.42s)]
*  drug. It's it's you and just how how extra defective you are. And what has now happened and Tucker, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4821.38s)]
*  you're not going to believe this. It's like, I'm sorry to laugh. This is just so it's totally [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4828.18s)]
*  bonkers. And what I what I would predict and because I'm seeing from my book, I did a lot of [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4833.3s)]
*  I woven a lot of research into my book. And I way more than I originally intended. And my editor [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4840.34s)]
*  kept wanting more, which which is great. And I went down this rabbit hole of looking at [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4844.9800000000005s)]
*  the current landscape of psychiatry and like, where is it heading? Because obviously these [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4852.02s)]
*  drug based paradigm is failing. So like, what's next for them? Because, you know, the drug companies [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4857.54s)]
*  are not making are not focusing relatively much at all on on psych drugs anymore. They've kind of [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4864.66s)]
*  moved on, they've recognized this isn't where the big bucks are. And so I was just curious, I was [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4870.820000000001s)]
*  like, so where is it heading? And what this new unfolding chapter of psychiatry is literally [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4877.22s)]
*  exploiting is this treatment resistance concept. It's building a new a new chapter of medical [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4884.5s)]
*  devices, literally inserting electrodes into the brain that are wired to it's called deep brain [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4892.1s)]
*  stimulation, where you you if you have treatment resistant depression, because your meds haven't [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4898.34s)]
*  helped you. Don't worry, Tucker. Now you just go in for a simple procedure, we're just going to [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4903.54s)]
*  open up your chest cavity, insert a heart pacemaker like device there, and run some wires up [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4910.02s)]
*  into your brain. And then your doctor can press a remote control button to send electrical [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4916.9800000000005s)]
*  stimulation, which we believe is going to help target the particular areas of your brain [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4922.660000000001s)]
*  that are involved. Is she making this up? Or is this real? This is literal, literally happening. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4929.14s)]
*  Besides deep brain stimulation, there's, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4934.26s)]
*  do you think there's anybody who would allow a doctor to implant something in his brain? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4937.3s)]
*  Oh, it's happening. It's deep DBS is not wide under remote control. So you're giving somebody [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4942.179999999999s)]
*  else the power to control your physically control your brain. Yep. With electricity, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4950.82s)]
*  you hear that clicking in the background. That's the sound of seriousness. That is the sound of [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4958.0199999999995s)]
*  the new Alp machined steel travel tin. And it's made right here in Montana by our friends [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4963.3s)]
*  at machinen USA. It's milled from solid metal with the world's absolute best [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4974.34s)]
*  tactile feedback retention mechanism. It's totally real. It feels like closing the door on a well [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4981.22s)]
*  built truck. It comes in cream, gray, green and black. You could drive over this in your truck [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4988.66s)]
*  and it would be totally fine. Dropping your bag through the concrete doesn't matter. It'll [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4995.7s)]
*  still be there. This holds your Alp. And there was, I have read a few horror [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=4999.62s)]
*  stories of anecdotal experiences of people who've had these, these procedures. And then [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5011.62s)]
*  afterwards, like the battery dies and then you can't get the device out because it's like [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5017.86s)]
*  too complicated to remove it. So there's just like a dead, you know, matchbox size thing that's like [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5024.98s)]
*  protruding from your chest under your skin. It's DBS is the probably the least common one right now. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5031.299999999999s)]
*  The big push right now is for what's called TMS, trans cranial magnetic stimulation, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5039.139999999999s)]
*  which is also for treatment resistant depression. So, you know, there's a wide array of options [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5044.900000000001s)]
*  for people. Don't despair. And you basically sit under this device that shoots like very powerful [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5049.38s)]
*  magnet magnetic, you know, currents, whatever you call energy through your skull. And it's being [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5057.22s)]
*  marketed as a non drug, you know, safe alternative because it's just magnets. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5065.540000000001s)]
*  And don't forget ECT, electroshock, which is alive and well, and that's long been a treatment [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5072.1s)]
*  resistant depression treatment. Yeah, I had a relative who did it and then committed suicide. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5078.74s)]
*  So yeah, it's been around for a long time. Yep. And I just want to restate what you said so [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5083.62s)]
*  eloquently, which is people subject themselves to these horrors because they are in such pain, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5092.66s)]
*  because they are so desperate, they will they will accept any treatment treatment because [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5098.66s)]
*  they're panicked and they're dying. So I get it. And they see no other options. 100%. I'm not [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5104.5s)]
*  judging anybody who submits to shock treatments or deep brain or whatever the hell that was. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5109.46s)]
*  But this is just the but does anybody ever say, you know, you really need to [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5117.3s)]
*  go outside more often, get a dog, make a date to sleep with your spouse every other day, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5121.62s)]
*  get on your knees and pray to God. Let's just start there. Like maybe take your [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5128.02s)]
*  shoes off on the lawn occasionally. Does anybody? Because that would be my program saying. And I [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5132.1s)]
*  think that works. Did anybody ever say that to you? No. And if like if you had met me 16 years ago [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5139.14s)]
*  and said that to me, I would have been like, fuck you. How dare you insult me? Do you not understand [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5146.1s)]
*  how seriously sick I am? You're telling me to get some sunlight. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5155.46s)]
*  And I think a lot of people feel that way. It's like it's invalidate. It feels invalid. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5163.14s)]
*  They're gonna really go after you. I just had this insight because you're too articulate. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5167.38s)]
*  Your your story is too great because you actually recovered from these tortures and [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5171.38s)]
*  you're a real threat. I just want to say that. I just want to be on the record saying that. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5179.7s)]
*  So just a fact like that New York Times story that I thought kind of slammed you in a subtle way. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5183.9400000000005s)]
*  That's just the beginning. Yeah. Did you? There was a Washington Post book review of my book that was [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5190.02s)]
*  wild. I mean, she was so I feel for her. I feel for all the people who are just outraged by my [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5196.1s)]
*  story because I know that at the heart, they're afraid. I know it's fear. And so I don't mean [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5204.9800000000005s)]
*  this in a, you know, I mean it from a heartfelt place. She was so, so set off by my story and her [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5210.42s)]
*  review. I mean, she was just, I can't remember the exact phrases, but just wild how vitriolic [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5219.7s)]
*  it was. It was it was an attack on my character. Really, it wasn't even really about my book, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5227.22s)]
*  this book review. And, you know, I was ready. I've been ready. I take it as a sign that I'm [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5232.66s)]
*  doing something right. That these large corporate media outlets are really pissed. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5239.22s)]
*  That you got better? You got better? They hate that. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5246.1s)]
*  And to be clear, because people, when I do feel better, but by better, I don't mean [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5250.26s)]
*  I'm like happy and put together. Like people often assume that I'm so-called mentally healthy now. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5257.06s)]
*  I, you can ask my husband, like do not catch me on a day where I have, you know, I'm sleep deprived [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5265.9400000000005s)]
*  and have been in front of my screen too much and I'm about to get my period and I feel really [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5272.900000000001s)]
*  stressed. Like I- You've got yelling children in the background. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5278.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. I mean, I definitely, I've been off of these drugs for 15 years now, but I can tell [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5281.54s)]
*  my central nervous system is still quite sensitized to stress. So I, and I've always [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5289.22s)]
*  been a big feeler from, you know, I was a little girl, like I have this vivid memory of one day, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5296.5s)]
*  I was outside in the sun in the summer and I saw this worm, this dead dried out worm, like shiny, [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5302.34s)]
*  it had been dehydrated by the sun. And I just remember crouching down and looking at it and [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5308.820000000001s)]
*  holding it and just crying this life that had been taken and I buried it in my [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5313.38s)]
*  gar- my mother's garden and I just, I couldn't handle facing them the, the death of this little [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5319.54s)]
*  bee. I mean, I've always been that kind of intense feeling person. And so I'm often angry. I'm often [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5325.62s)]
*  very angsty. I can get panicky. I feel a lot of grief about a lot of things. Like I could [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5333.54s)]
*  feel myself right now. Like I could start crying just thinking about all the kids right now who [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5341.14s)]
*  are getting sent to their first psychiatrist. Like if I sat down right now in front of a [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5346.18s)]
*  psychiatrist, they'd be like, oh gosh, Laura, you're a little emotionally late pile. Maybe, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5351.780000000001s)]
*  you know, we might want to consider some, you know, some balta or whatever. Like they wouldn't be [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5356.26s)]
*  able to compute. Like crying is actually a sign of being alive and being in touch with life. It's [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5362.26s)]
*  not a sign of pathology. And so I'm, I often find myself in this interesting position where [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5369.3s)]
*  I'm like defending how crazy I still am a lot of the time because people are like, you are so happy [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5374.66s)]
*  now and everything's great. I'm like, I am a dark, twisted, fucked up person. Basically on a daily [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5379.54s)]
*  basis. But you know what? I'm not afraid of it anymore. Like that's the big difference. Psychiatry [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5385.46s)]
*  and the mental health industry taught me to be terrified of my pain and my mind. And that's been [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5391.46s)]
*  the most liberating thing. But what's interesting is how terrified they are of healing. I mean, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5397.22s)]
*  there's this amazing scene in the New Testament. It's in Luke or John where Jesus heals a man who's [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5401.62s)]
*  been blind for his whole life since birth. And he's like, Jesus heal me. And Jesus goes, okay. And [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5407.62s)]
*  he puts mud in his eyes and washes it off in a pool. And he's, he can see. I mean, amazing. Talk [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5412.740000000001s)]
*  about healing. And the religious authorities, the Pharisees show up immediately and they're like, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5417.54s)]
*  who did this? And they start interrogating him. Then they interrogate his parents. And their only [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5421.62s)]
*  interest is not, they were infuriated by the fact he was healed, infuriated. And they're trying to [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5426.58s)]
*  find Jesus to kill him. And I'm like, that's like the most burnt screwed up thing I've ever read in [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5432.18s)]
*  my life. But it doesn't seem so different from the response that you're getting. It's like, I don't [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5438.18s)]
*  know, Laura Delano, maybe he has emotional days, but like happily married kids, like functional, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5443.78s)]
*  like enjoying life, loving life, loving people. That's like such a massive win. You know what I [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5449.54s)]
*  mean? But they're like mad about it. I don't know. Yeah. No. And I think when you realize that [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5455.3s)]
*  the objective to living is not happiness, it's meaning and purpose and finding your calling [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5461.14s)]
*  in the world and the way that you are meant to be of service to the world. I mean, when you [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5469.38s)]
*  find access, when you find your way to those states, then you don't care about being happy [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5474.66s)]
*  all the time anymore. You don't care about the next quick fix because that's just like, you just, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5482.74s)]
*  you know, like that's not the point to being here. And I think that message is such a threat, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5489.94s)]
*  not just to the mental health industry, but to so many, so much of consumerism more broadly. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5495.86s)]
*  If, you know, once you realize, A, the answers and, you know, expertise that I'm seeking don't lie [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5501.7s)]
*  out there in all these so-called experts or products or pills or services. It's, if I look [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5512.5s)]
*  inwards and I just trust that if I do the next right thing, I find ways to get out of self. I [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5521.06s)]
*  mean, that's like my go-to when I'm getting a little too occupied with myself, which a long [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5527.62s)]
*  career as a therapy patient primes you to be. I'm like, okay, what's the fastest way I can forget [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5532.34s)]
*  myself? Usually it's like playing with my stepson or my son. Or it's, you know, reaching back out to [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5538.9s)]
*  someone who's called me in a struggle and, you know, a tough spot. When you realize like, you [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5545.94s)]
*  can do that anytime you want, like get out of yourself. Then you're like, why would I go pay, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5551.78s)]
*  pay all these professionals to like, listen to me ramble on about myself every week for [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5558.74s)]
*  a fucking 10 years. So that was the thing that I was really struck by almost five hour dinner last [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5564.5s)]
*  night. And I asked you all about your life and your story and your family and all this stuff. And [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5567.86s)]
*  so we talked about your life, but a lot, but you did not talk about yourself in a way. You were [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5572.099999999999s)]
*  at all. It was like, and that was really striking to me because I do think the hallmark of a therapy [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5578.42s)]
*  person is narcissism. I'm sorry to say that. I think they're really hurting people, including [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5587.22s)]
*  people I love who go to therapy, whatever. But so I don't want to be mean at all, but I do think that [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5592.9s)]
*  narcissism is death. And I feel like it encourages it. Do you think that? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5598.02s)]
*  I think a lot of, I mean, there are some modalities that I've never tried myself that are [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5603.06s)]
*  for example, one is called somatic experiencing therapy. I think, um, to my understanding, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5610.1s)]
*  it's actually about getting you out of your mind and into your body. So when you talk about, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5617.06s)]
*  I'm anxious, they're like, what does that feel like in your body? It's like yoga kind of. Yeah. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5622.5s)]
*  And so I think there are some modalities. I'm sure there are great kinds of therapy, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5626.9800000000005s)]
*  but the traditional, like, let's talk about your mother kind of thing. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5630.82s)]
*  I totally agree with you. It teaches you to navel gaze. It teaches you that whatever like [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5633.86s)]
*  fleeting emotion or thought is in your head is like so important. Most important thing in the world, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5640.42s)]
*  nothing else matters, but your own upset. And if you think about it, if you scale outwards and [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5647.299999999999s)]
*  imagine that at scale, it's like, what do you get? You get the social order that we have right now, [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5654.0199999999995s)]
*  where everyone is driven. I'm being a little sensational here, but where so many people are [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5659.46s)]
*  driven by their outrage, driven by their fear. And my, you know, unscientific theory that I just, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5664.9s)]
*  based on my own experience and what I've seen in so many people is like, I can't help but wonder [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5674.02s)]
*  how much of that is because a lot of these people grew up therapeuticized and taught to [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5678.74s)]
*  prioritize and privilege how they feel all the time and then like decide what should happen next [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5684.74s)]
*  based on that. Like, I am outraged. Like you hurt my feelings. Like now let's cancel you or, you know, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5691.3s)]
*  I think the therapeutic element here is potentially a significant piece. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5699.54s)]
*  Well, it's the same, it's the same people, you know, 100% of the people who've ever yelled at me [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5705.0599999999995s)]
*  in public are from the demographic that you're describing. And I don't want to be more precise [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5709.94s)]
*  because I don't want to make race or class part of it, but it's very noticeable. You know, it's [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5714.82s)]
*  people in expensive therapy programs who are mad at their husbands and like talking a lot about [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5720.66s)]
*  themselves. Those are the ones who scream at me. I've just noticed that. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5725.94s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised. Yeah. And it's so when you, to me, one of the great [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5728.66s)]
*  tragedies of this is that when you, you know, the, because there are so few visible spaces [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5734.58s)]
*  in our culture right now where you can get help that isn't a paid service. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5742.98s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5746.74s)]
*  You know, people just, they just don't even realize that's an option in the first place. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5747.86s)]
*  They're so, we've been so disempowered by all these helping industries that have billions and [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5753.3s)]
*  billions of dollars to make off of us thinking we need them. That people don't even realize the [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5759.86s)]
*  power and capacity they have to be with someone in great distress. Like, you know, because of the [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5765.46s)]
*  work that I do and the work that my husband does, like we are often, like our home, for example, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5772.0199999999995s)]
*  we have a spare bedroom and the way we live our lives is like, we have a spare bedroom. Like if [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5777.46s)]
*  you are in a crisis, you're feeling lost and you know, like we know you and we trust you, like come, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5783.14s)]
*  come stay and eat dinner with us and, you know, hang out with our yelling children and just [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5790.26s)]
*  be with us in our lives. And, you know- [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5800.42s)]
*  Oh, you're making me emotional. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5803.780000000001s)]
*  And, you know, of course we are in a position where we have a house with an extra room. Like, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5806.820000000001s)]
*  I'm mindful that so much of my story, and I try to talk about this all the time, like class economic [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5810.98s)]
*  factors are a huge, are a huge factor here. So I acknowledge that not everyone can do this [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5817.219999999999s)]
*  if they wanted to, but just as an example, there's someone we know in our neighborhood who [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5825.139999999999s)]
*  just all anonymize the descriptors just to protect them. They're young, they got psychiatrized [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5831.78s)]
*  as a teen, bad things had happened to them. They ended up, instead of those bad things being [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5839.62s)]
*  addressed, they ended up getting sent to a psychiatrist and diagnosed and medicated. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5844.66s)]
*  Now they're in their early twenties and they really haven't yet figured out how to be an [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5850.0199999999995s)]
*  adult in the world because they're just emerging from the psychiatric nightmare, so to speak. So [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5855.46s)]
*  this person called me up a couple months ago and I have to stop saying they. She was on her way, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5862.18s)]
*  she was on her way to the hospital. She's like, I love your commitment to good grammar. I just love [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5870.34s)]
*  that. That is one benefit of the high school and college you went to. It's like, it pains you. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5874.74s)]
*  I couldn't do it. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5880.74s)]
*  It's a plural pronoun for a second. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5881.54s)]
*  I'm like, it's still anonymous. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5885.46s)]
*  I love that. Thank you. I hate the word they, not just because of the trans thing, but just [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5886.74s)]
*  yeah, I couldn't do it. It's still anonymous enough. There are a lot of women in my neighborhood. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5891.86s)]
*  51% of the population. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5898.1s)]
*  She was like, I'm on my way to the hospital. I think I'm going to die. I think I'm having a [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5899.3s)]
*  heart attack. So I instantly was like, I think she's having a panic attack. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5902.66s)]
*  For sure. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5905.62s)]
*  And I was like, well, so what is it that you're wanting by going to the ER? And she's like, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5906.82s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know. And then she started thinking it through and she's like, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5913.38s)]
*  and I know what's going to happen. They're just going to admit me. And I was like, and then, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5917.3s)]
*  yeah, and then you'll be impatient. And then, and I just walked her through just to help her [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5920.9800000000005s)]
*  remember like how this goes. Like you don't just go into the ER and then someone makes you a cup [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5924.66s)]
*  of tea and comforts you and then sends you on your way. You're like boarding sometimes for days on a [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5929.54s)]
*  psych ward with a security guard watching you. And then you're carted off to some psych ward. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5935.14s)]
*  And who knows how long you'll be there. And then, you know, it just disrupts like potentially months [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5939.860000000001s)]
*  of your life. So I was like, why didn't you just, we're about to have dinner. Cooper's [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5944.42s)]
*  almost done cooking. Just come over and have dinner with us. And she came over and she's just [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5948.02s)]
*  like the loveliest young woman who I see. I get so emotional. I see so much of me in her and she's [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5954.740000000001s)]
*  like super lost right now. She's just trying to emerge from this dark, dark experience of being a [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5961.06s)]
*  psych patient. And so she comes into her house and the first thing she says, it's like, do you ever [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5968.660000000001s)]
*  have thoughts of killing yourself? I'm like, girl, all the fuck does. I'm like, me, of course we have. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5974.1s)]
*  Of course I have. I mean, I don't think about that anymore, but literally every day for like a decade, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5981.06s)]
*  I was like, should I kill myself today? And so what I think, and I could feel in her instantly, [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5985.54s)]
*  like a shift and her poor pan was out in the driveway, had been driving her and he was like [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5991.9400000000005s)]
*  a deer in headlight. So I was like, we're good. You go on. Like we're good. I'll touch base with [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=5997.700000000001s)]
*  you later. And what she felt in me was that I wasn't afraid. And instantly she, I could feel her [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6003.22s)]
*  be like, oh, and I was like, come on, let's go eat. And we just sat down at the table, our yelling [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6009.9400000000005s)]
*  children are like, you know, being wild men and we didn't, we didn't over dramatize what she was in. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6014.900000000001s)]
*  We just like had a regular dinner together and I could just feel her energetically like [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6024.42s)]
*  like settling in, opening up. And she ended up staying with us for a week, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6028.9s)]
*  staying, sleeping in our room. Like we hadn't planned on it. And just in that period of time, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6035.299999999999s)]
*  like all we did was offer her a space where she could be fully be herself in all of her darkness. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6039.54s)]
*  We weren't afraid of it. We listened, we, we, we didn't make a huge deal out of it. We just like [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6046.9s)]
*  kind of brought her into our life and went on walks and we talked about stuff and she did need [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6054.34s)]
*  to talk a lot about stuff. There was stuff to work through, but it was that simple. And when I, you [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6059.38s)]
*  know, I, I recognize this might sound a bit romantic, you know, just, and how, and how [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6066.900000000001s)]
*  unfeasible this kind of thing is for so many people to do. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6072.58s)]
*  What, human connection, love? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6075.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6076.9800000000005s)]
*  No, it's very possible. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6077.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm with you. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6080.42s)]
*  It's the most possible thing. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6081.3s)]
*  It's possible, but, but again, like our social order is set up in such a way where it feels [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6082.34s)]
*  impossible for so many people. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6087.14s)]
*  Well, then commit the revolutionary act of loving someone one-on-one, non-judgmentally, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6088.34s)]
*  bring them into your home, have dinner with them, make them sit there while your kids cry. Like that [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6092.9800000000005s)]
*  is the answer to everything actually. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6097.38s)]
*  Yeah. And it costs no money. It pays the college, the college tuition of no children. It's like just [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6099.06s)]
*  built on empathy. It's, it's support built on empathy, not profit. And that's, I think part of [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6110.26s)]
*  why a lot of people are pissed at me right now is that the, the nonprofit that I started, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6116.58s)]
*  Intercompass Initiative that my husband, Cooper now runs, our mission is to help people make [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6122.66s)]
*  more informed choices about all of this stuff. So like everything that you weren't told by your [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6131.06s)]
*  doctor, we have it available for free on our website. We teach you how to read a drug label. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6134.74s)]
*  We walk you through like how these drugs are researched and brought to market, the history [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6140.26s)]
*  of the DSM, you know, psychiatry's so-called Bible of disorders, how unscientific it is. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6146.099999999999s)]
*  Like it's literally based on voting. You vote disorders in and out based on, you know, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6151.86s)]
*  the opinions of these, the committee members, most, many of whom have drug company money. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6157.94s)]
*  So we provide all of that for free, but really the most radical, which of course is like not [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6163.54s)]
*  radical thing we do is we help people help each other. So like mutual aid in the, in the most pure [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6170.179999999999s)]
*  sense of the word, like AA, like that, that, that support that you offer and receive from fellow [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6176.42s)]
*  humans who've been where you've been. And it's, it's driven not by the desire to make money, but [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6183.62s)]
*  because of love and, and, and service. And to me, that's the biggest threat to the mental health [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6190.740000000001s)]
*  industry is when enough people realize I have the power and the people, you know, in my neighborhood, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6198.18s)]
*  of course, many people don't even know their neighbors. And that's a problem. When you, [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6205.22s)]
*  when you band together and you realize like we can help each other through dark nights of the soul, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6209.9400000000005s)]
*  like think about how much, how, how many services and prescriptions and facilities will be no longer [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6214.5s)]
*  needed. And yeah, the fact that that's a radical concept and a dangerous one, you're not a doctor. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6224.5s)]
*  I mean, the number of times you're like, you should be sued, you're practicing medical advice. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6232.66s)]
*  Medical advice. I'm like, how is speaking about my own experiences, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6237.78s)]
*  practicing unsolicited medical advice or whatever it is they say, it's just, it's wild how dehumanized [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6245.22s)]
*  we've all been by these industries that, that convince us we don't have the power to be with [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6252.98s)]
*  our pain, to be with each other in pain. So I was really moved by that, I will say, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6262.34s)]
*  like emotionally moved by that. And I, a couple wise people in my life have convinced me of [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6268.18s)]
*  something in the last year or so, which is stop being shocked by evil that you see in the world. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6273.860000000001s)]
*  That's the status quo. It's always been that way. If every time you see something horrible, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6279.06s)]
*  hear your story about how kids are being put on life destroying drugs. I can't believe that. It's [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6283.38s)]
*  like, no, that's the way it is. What we should be shocked by are acts of love and altruism and [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6288.02s)]
*  self-sacrifice. And that's unnatural. That's like supernatural. That's what we should be thrilled by. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6295.46s)]
*  So I believe that I've come to believe that. And I was just, I was absolutely thrilled [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6301.860000000001s)]
*  and moved by the love that you showed to the, your neighbor who's having a panic attack. It's like, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6306.34s)]
*  if everybody did that once a week, like we would, we'd be like living in the kingdom of God. I mean, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6311.700000000001s)]
*  that's like, anyway, that's my view. So, but I just want to, you've been very nice about psychiatrists [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6317.06s)]
*  and you gave them the benefit of the doubt that these are people of goodwill. And I love [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6323.700000000001s)]
*  to hear you do that and give everyone the benefit of the doubt. However, I, I, maybe I think you're [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6328.42s)]
*  being a little generous. Like how can they keep doing something that's not working? And why is it [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6334.18s)]
*  that I'm sure they're great psychiatrists, but I've known a number of psychiatrists and they're the [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6341.3s)]
*  craziest people I've ever met in my life with the most screwed up personal lives. Like they've no [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6345.06s)]
*  standing to give other people life advice. Like what? So I don't know. Am I being too mean? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6350.1s)]
*  I mean, I think you're asking an important question. And I think, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6356.9800000000005s)]
*  you know, to the question of why, why do screwed up people become psychiatrists, [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6362.5s)]
*  I think, you know, speaking for myself as a screwed up person, you know, you're on a, [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6367.860000000001s)]
*  quest to understand yourself and, and because the only visible place where, not the only, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6372.98s)]
*  but the primary visible place in our culture where you go to do that is psychiatry or psychology. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6380.34s)]
*  When you yourself are screwed up and then you think about what you want to do with your life, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6387.86s)]
*  whether you're conscious of this or not, I do think maybe that's why you're pulled to [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6393.14s)]
*  this field. I get it. Okay. That's not a bad reason. And it's not, it's not a justification [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6397.78s)]
*  or an excuse for them, but I do think a lot of people come to this profession from a place of [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6402.9s)]
*  true, originally at least like true curiosity and, and openness and desire to help. Exactly. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6410.099999999999s)]
*  Exactly. I had problems. I'm going to help other people. I think that's, well, you clearly feel [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6417.62s)]
*  that way in your own life. So that's a good thing. I guess what I'm saying is you want wise people [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6420.98s)]
*  compassionate, empathetic people who really are putting others at the center of their lives. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6427.38s)]
*  That's the profile of the, of the healer. And I, there are some exceptions. Anna Lemke at [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6431.78s)]
*  Stanford is a wonderful person, psychiatrist, but she is right there on the cover. They're on the [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6437.46s)]
*  bottom. She's, she is a huge exception to everything I'm saying, but, but in general, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6443.94s)]
*  like you don't feel a lot of wisdom coming off these people. And my, what I think is part of [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6450.34s)]
*  why that ends up happening is that the, the indoctrination that young medical students, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6456.66s)]
*  because I think this, this goes beyond just psychiatry to much of kind of allopathic medicine [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6464.66s)]
*  where, where doctor, young doctors or, you know, young medical school students are, you know, in, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6470.26s)]
*  in year one, for example, I think to my understanding at the beginning, at least pre COVID, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6477.94s)]
*  maybe things have changed with COVID, but the beginning of your first year, you're given your [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6483.38s)]
*  cadaver. And I can't remember who, where I read this, but I read it many years ago from, from [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6488.34s)]
*  someone who was writing critically about the medical enterprise and basically saying that's [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6495.9400000000005s)]
*  very deliberate. You enter into medical school because you want to help. You want to help heal. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6501.14s)]
*  And then the first thing that you are thrown into is basically this experience of having this [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6506.5s)]
*  object in front of you who once was your fellow brother or sister and is now just [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6511.46s)]
*  an object that you're going to cut apart. I think that's a, it's really like a degradation [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6516.1s)]
*  ritual that, that you are put through so that you can separate yourself from this fellow human. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6523.3s)]
*  And it becomes a specimen. It becomes an object and it, and so I think this phenomenon happens [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6529.78s)]
*  across medicine where, you know, you have an issue with your thyroid or whatever body part, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6537.38s)]
*  part of you, and you sit in front of a specialist who is trained to just see you as, you know, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6545.78s)]
*  they are trained to not emote. They are trained, you are actually as a doctor, not meant to feel [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6552.66s)]
*  too much because how could you sustainably do this for decades if you're just emoting all the time and, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6558.82s)]
*  and opening yourself up and being vulnerable? Like you're meant to be closed off. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6563.94s)]
*  Who came up with that idea? I don't know. I mean, I don't know enough about- [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6568.98s)]
*  You weep over your children. You laugh with your children. Like you're so emotionally engaged with [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6572.0199999999995s)]
*  your children at all times if you're a good parent and that's the way to parent them. That's the way [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6576.98s)]
*  to heal them. I don't get it. Yeah. I mean, I don't think you could survive because I don't think it, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6581.7s)]
*  it's feasible to cross. So let's go back to psychiatry. You know, if you're as a psychiatrist, [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6588.9800000000005s)]
*  let's say you work for 40 years, so you cross paths with thousands and thousands of people, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6595.38s)]
*  you don't have the bandwidth to fully emote and be open and be vulnerable. You have to survive that. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6599.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, my view is that, and knowing many mental health professionals, like you either, if you are, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6607.7s)]
*  if you stay in touch, like you can't stay in touch with your heart and your humanity and last [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6613.7s)]
*  for decades in this. You either have to numb out and disconnect and come to view your patients as [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6620.9s)]
*  these other, like you have to other them and just see them as lists of symptoms to write scripts for. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6627.86s)]
*  Like, or you quit or have a breakdown or like, I have to imagine that it is not [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6634.34s)]
*  possible to be fully in touch with your own humanity for decades, immersed in the suffering [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6641.86s)]
*  and struggle of like thousands of people. So I almost like, I feel for the spot that. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6648.58s)]
*  I do too. I just, but there's an irreconcilable problem at the core of it, which is you can't [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6655.0599999999995s)]
*  heal people without loving them, period. You can't actually make the best decision for somebody else [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6661.0599999999995s)]
*  unless you love that person. So, and in the absence of love, you wind up with a system [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6668.9s)]
*  like the one you're describing where we're destroying people and like, there's a lot of [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6674.339999999999s)]
*  evidence that we're destroying people and we're continuing to do it. So like, what does that tell you? [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6678.259999999999s)]
*  They don't love those people. You're raising, I mean, this is the fundamental, like kind of philosophical [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6682.419999999999s)]
*  spiritual dilemma of the modern mental health industry is that when you commodify care and you [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6687.54s)]
*  turn it into a service, you can't love because you can't, they're in Congress with each other. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6695.94s)]
*  And so if what you're saying is true, which I believe, what does that mean for the legitimacy [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6703.139999999999s)]
*  of the kind of foundations of this massive, like mega billion dollar industry that, because it's so [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6712.0199999999995s)]
*  many, it's obviously drug companies, the hospital industry, managed care, it's psychiatry, psychology, [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6718.66s)]
*  social work, it's medical device companies, it's just all the industries that supply hospitals with [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6724.34s)]
*  food. And I mean, when you think about how much money is made off of commodifying the care of [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6731.62s)]
*  suffering people and medicalizing that suffering, we're in quite a dilemma here. And this isn't me [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6736.900000000001s)]
*  saying like, blow up the mental health industry. Like it's obviously, it exists, it's not going [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6746.58s)]
*  away tomorrow. But I do think like my view is what I want to spend the rest of my life doing is [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6751.14s)]
*  helping people who in their heart feel that this isn't right for them. Like if you feel helped by [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6757.860000000001s)]
*  your meds, you love your psychiatrist, all the power to you, like that's, I'm truly happy for you. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6763.860000000001s)]
*  But if something in you is like, is this my answer? Like, is this really helping me? [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6771.14s)]
*  Is there something different, something more? Like if something in you is calling you to that [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6775.3s)]
*  question, like those are the people who I want to reach, who I want to connect with. And I think [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6782.26s)]
*  slowly over time, the more of us asking these questions and forging different paths, like slowly [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6791.06s)]
*  over time, the demand for this industry will lessen. And I mean, this is probably going to be [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6798.9s)]
*  multi-generation evolution here. It's not going to change overnight. But when enough people [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6804.98s)]
*  with each passing decade, we actually meet their neighbors, like go literally knock on the doors [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6812.339999999999s)]
*  of their neighbors with a pot of soup, saying like, hi, we've lived next to each other for five years. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6817.7s)]
*  Like, I'm just, let's just finally meet each other, you know, like when enough people do that, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6822.82s)]
*  and then band together for potluck dinners, for crisis networks. Like imagine one of my fantasies [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6828.5s)]
*  is that the three streets, so we live on a grid and the street next to us on either side, like, [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6835.0599999999995s)]
*  you know, I've thought often about making a flyer, putting it in the mailbox of every single person. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6842.98s)]
*  I mean, like, let's all get together and meet. Let's all share our stories with each other, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6847.94s)]
*  figure out who has what tools that we can exchange and borrow, figure out who has extra bedrooms, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6853.780000000001s)]
*  in case, you know, if your kid is in a crisis and you need a break, come on over here, you know, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6860.02s)]
*  to really get that grassroots about it. Like this might sound crazy to you, but I'm like, imagine if [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6864.580000000001s)]
*  every town and every city across the country, like enough people realize how much power they have. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6870.9800000000005s)]
*  Live normal lives, like people have always lived? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6877.22s)]
*  Like how we used to. Pre-industrial revolution, right. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6879.3s)]
*  So I think most people, I'm definitely in the category would trade life expectancy for that. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6883.06s)]
*  It's like, oh, it's been modernity has been such a huge win. Antibiotics, I'm not against antibiotics. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6886.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm against, you know, I'm for long life expectancy, but like, you also have to [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6891.9400000000005s)]
*  acknowledge what was lost. Well, I know life expectancy is dropping. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6896.660000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm aware. I'm highly aware. You don't even have that. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6899.860000000001s)]
*  Okay, so I've got two more big questions for you. The first is, how did you go from being like [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6903.700000000001s)]
*  damaged to the point of attempting suicide repeatedly, the most damage you can be and [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6910.1s)]
*  still be alive to being someone with, I can say having interviewed thousands of people, [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6914.820000000001s)]
*  a person of unusual wisdom, truly unusual wisdom. How did that happen? Like what was the moment [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6920.18s)]
*  where you set upon the path of liberation? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6927.780000000001s)]
*  Well, I think so my turning point when I realized like this industry doesn't have my answers [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6933.54s)]
*  happened when I was 27, it was 2010. I was, you know, just months of just unfolding dysfunction [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6944.9s)]
*  and craziness. And I found myself in a substance abuse day program because I had decided to quit [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6957.06s)]
*  drinking specifically because I had been convinced that maybe the reason why all these meds weren't [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6968.18s)]
*  helping me was because I was getting shit faced every night. And if I, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6974.5s)]
*  the booze is getting in the way of the pills. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6979.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I mean, they were making rather than, I mean, which was true. Yes, this is true. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6981.78s)]
*  The booze was complicating things. But of course, the booze was also what was keeping me alive. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6988.0199999999995s)]
*  Like ironically, getting drunk was the one thing that kept me from killing myself for literally [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6992.58s)]
*  years because at least I didn't care how messed up my life was. So I had been very resistant to [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=6998.259999999999s)]
*  quitting drinking for that reason. And then, you know, on my, what ended up being my second [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7004.66s)]
*  to last hospitalization, just for whatever reason, I heard this message from a mental health worker [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7010.5s)]
*  about maybe try not drinking. And I think because I was still holding on to hope that [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7018.18s)]
*  maybe the meds would one day help me, I was like, okay, okay, because maybe he's right. If I stop [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7024.9s)]
*  drinking my super treatment resistant bipolar disorder, like maybe now it will be treated. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7029.46s)]
*  So I was in this substance abuse day program. I was living with my aunt and uncle who had [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7035.78s)]
*  generously offered up their home to me. And the psychopharmacologist on my like, you know, [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7042.26s)]
*  five person treatment team kind of caught wind that I was like having a hard time and maybe [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7050.34s)]
*  becoming suicidal, which I was. And he was like, you know what, Laura, why don't you get, take a [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7058.1s)]
*  break? Like, why don't you go over to the short term unit and just, you know, so you can feel safe. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7065.14s)]
*  And I was like, you're right. I wanted to go. I loved, I was so afraid of myself that I loved [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7070.58s)]
*  going onto psych wards because it was the only place where I felt safe for myself. So I was like [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7077.620000000001s)]
*  into it. I loved it. So I was like, great idea. I just want to go home first. Let me get my [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7083.86s)]
*  belongings. It's not fun going onto a locked ward without anything like any of your comforting [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7088.5s)]
*  possessions. And he's like, oh, I can't let you do that. I was like, what do you mean? He's like, [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7096.5s)]
*  well, you're suicidal right now. So I have to take you directly there. I can't let you leave. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7100.98s)]
*  And I was like, I just told you, I want to go like I'm coming back. I really mean it. And I [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7107.0599999999995s)]
*  meant that I was, he's like, I'm sorry. And I something in me, it kind of like really outrage [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7110.74s)]
*  ignited in me. And I was like, this isn't fair. Like I'm coming back. And I started to raise my [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7118.099999999999s)]
*  voice and I started to get more angry. He ended up calling security and a couple of security guards [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7122.5s)]
*  came on by and they escorted me over to this unit and they gave me the so-called choice of going [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7130.74s)]
*  voluntarily or involuntarily. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7136.900000000001s)]
*  Well, this progressed quickly, didn't it? Oh my gosh. In a matter of, you know, [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7140.58s)]
*  15 minutes and never in my wildest dreams had I ever considered that I might once be faced with [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7144.02s)]
*  this kind of situation because I had been this good little mental patient for so many years doing [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7151.46s)]
*  everything my doctor said, always saying yes, taking my meds as prescribed. It's like so diligent [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7157.38s)]
*  and good at what I was doing as a patient. And now here I was non-compliant. And that [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7164.26s)]
*  recognition that my psychiatrist had the power to strip me of my civil liberties and incarcerate me [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7173.06s)]
*  on a unit, stripping me of my right to fresh air and freedom, dislodged this like deep, [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7180.42s)]
*  deep faith that I had always had. Not at the very beginning, but from age 18 on [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7187.780000000001s)]
*  that I had had in this system. And I had two more experiences like that where I was, [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7193.38s)]
*  you know, made to take a drug that I didn't want to take. And then after I had been discharged from [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7199.54s)]
*  that, what would be my last hospitalization, I slept through a therapy appointment because I [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7205.62s)]
*  was so tranquilized by that drug. And my therapist called the cops to do a wellness check on me, [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7210.98s)]
*  which I talk about in the book. Those three experiences with the, basically the power that [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7217.46s)]
*  psychiatry has to force you to do things you don't want to do, made me step back and just start [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7224.9800000000005s)]
*  questioning all of it. And it was in that questioning space that, and the fact that I had [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7231.78s)]
*  quit drinking, I hadn't yet found AA. So I was like really fucking miserable because I just like [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7239.54s)]
*  I removed the one thing that I had for relief without doing any work on myself. So I was really, [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7244.82s)]
*  really miserable. But in that space opened up this new curiosity, like who would I be off of [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7251.219999999999s)]
*  these meds? I've been on these meds since I was a kid. Like I've never known myself as an adult [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7261.0599999999995s)]
*  off meds. Like what would my baseline look like? What would my personality be like? How would I [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7266.259999999999s)]
*  think? What would I care about? What would my body look like? Like I just suddenly started [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7272.66s)]
*  wondering these things. And because I was questioning the power, the psychiatric power, [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7277.54s)]
*  basically, I just opened up to the possibility that not all was as it seemed. And then it was [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7283.46s)]
*  in that space that I found a book by a medical journalist named Ryan. And I was like, I'm not [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7293.14s)]
*  sure if I'm going to read this book. The book is called Anatomy of an Epidemic. And in a nutshell, [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7299.7s)]
*  he was curious about the fact that outcome, long-term outcomes for people diagnosed with [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7307.46s)]
*  schizophrenia are much better in the so-called third world, in countries where they don't have [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7315.139999999999s)]
*  these sophisticated medicines. And he was intrigued by that. Like why are outcomes better [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7323.38s)]
*  in poor countries that don't have a lot of drugs? Because he had been under the assumption that [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7327.86s)]
*  these drugs are these great, amazing things. And so he did this deep dive investigation and basically [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7332.82s)]
*  posits this very compelling, makes this very compelling case that if you look at long-term [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7341.7s)]
*  data on psych drugs, on the whole, they're making us sicker, more disabled. And there I was on five [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7347.54s)]
*  psych drugs, previous 10 years of my life that I'd been this compliant patient, like progressively [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7356.9800000000005s)]
*  falling apart every month, month after month after month. I was physically sick, all these chronic [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7363.06s)]
*  health issues, no friends, couldn't work, suicidal all the time, totally financially dependent on my [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7369.06s)]
*  family, like a fucking mess. And in that beautiful, terrifying moment of like starting this book, [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7375.38s)]
*  I realized like, holy shit, what if it's not treatment resistant mental illness? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7382.34s)]
*  What if it's the treatment? It's coming from inside the house. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7387.62s)]
*  That's like really, wow. And that was like the beginning of, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7396.42s)]
*  that set me on this path that I've been on ever since, where I just knew I had to find out who I [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7403.06s)]
*  would be off of these drugs. I had to find out. In the beginning when I was still, [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7410.74s)]
*  I still believed I had bipolar disorder. I still believed in the chemical imbalance theory. I [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7418.34s)]
*  wasn't even questioning any of that stuff yet, but I was just like, I want to find out what my [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7422.34s)]
*  untreated bipolar state is. At least let me see. Maybe I could manage it without meds. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7427.38s)]
*  I started there when I quickly began to educate myself about the DSM, this textbook that [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7433.62s)]
*  the entire psychiatric enterprise is built around. Oh, you have four out of seven of these [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7442.74s)]
*  symptoms, it means you have this. So you have three out of five of them, it means you have that. And [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7448.099999999999s)]
*  of course, our insurance system is built around it for billing codes. It's what the whole entire [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7451.7s)]
*  psychiatric research enterprise has been built around. This textbook that I had just assumed [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7457.3s)]
*  for all these years was this rigorously researched scientific text. I quickly realized it's [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7464.5s)]
*  completely subjective, completely unscientific, and even the NIMH itself and all of these key [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7471.38s)]
*  opinion leaders in psychiatry admit this. This is not controversial to say. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7480.18s)]
*  I learned that very quickly and that was just the first onion layer of self-education that I [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7484.58s)]
*  basically just kept going deeper into. I realized every single fucking thing that I believed about [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7489.22s)]
*  myself through the most formative years of my life, about my suffering, about my mind, about [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7496.18s)]
*  everything was like a marketing trick. Everything I thought I knew. It was terrifying to face this. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7503.3s)]
*  My whole world fell apart. I had no idea who I was because all that I had been for so long was [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7513.62s)]
*  so-called mentally ill. But I just was so determined to figure it out. And then God, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7519.86s)]
*  I had been born into a family who could provide for me and literally put a roof over my head while [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7527.38s)]
*  I did because when I then came off of these drugs way too fast, and I want to make sure we talk about [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7533.78s)]
*  this because I had no idea that all these drugs I'd been on for all of these years had completely [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7541.3s)]
*  changed my central nervous system and that my brain was physically dependent on them. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7549.860000000001s)]
*  You had no idea? [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7555.38s)]
*  No idea. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7556.26s)]
*  So the physicians who prescribed them never told you that? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7557.06s)]
*  Never told me. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7560.1s)]
*  They should be arrested. That's what I think. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7560.820000000001s)]
*  Well, what's wild, Tucker, is that it is not even, you know, in certain drug labels, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7563.38s)]
*  acknowledge dependence like benzodiazepines. Those drug labels will acknowledge dependence. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7569.14s)]
*  Because you can die getting off them. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7574.42s)]
*  Yeah, you can have seizures if you stop them abruptly. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7576.02s)]
*  But a lot of drug labels say nothing about this. And the establishment, you know, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7580.58s)]
*  authorities often do not acknowledge this, at least not for like all of the psych drugs. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7587.9400000000005s)]
*  Benzos maybe they do, but antidepressants, mood stabilizers, obviously the sleep aids, [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7594.34s)]
*  which are very similar chemically to benzos, stimulants, all of them are psychoactive chemicals [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7600.9800000000005s)]
*  that, you know, when you take them regularly for years, like you are going to become dependent on [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7608.18s)]
*  them. And so because I didn't know that, I didn't know that I needed to taper off really slowly. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7614.66s)]
*  And by slow, I don't mean like a few weeks or a few months. Like, people who've been on these drugs [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7622.5s)]
*  for any length of time, especially like a decade or longer, often need years of tapering. Years. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7629.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm not even kidding you, Tucker, because the withdrawal symptoms can be so debilitating if [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7637.54s)]
*  they try going faster. And I feel like I've said the word insidious like 30 times in this interview, [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7642.74s)]
*  but so much of it is insidious. The insidious thing is that because our public does not understand [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7649.86s)]
*  how dependence forming these drugs are, and because doctors don't realize it, and are certainly not [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7656.66s)]
*  telling their patients this, when people come off their psych meds too quickly and they feel like [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7662.259999999999s)]
*  shit, intense anxiety, insomnia, despair, panic, you know, paranoia, whatever ends up happening, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7667.219999999999s)]
*  they're told, oh, you're having a relapse of your illness. Like, see, this is why you need [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7675.22s)]
*  to stay on your meds. So it keeps people in this vicious cycle for literally decades, because when [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7680.18s)]
*  they try to stop, they feel horrible. And then they use that as a reason to go back on. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7686.9s)]
*  Yeah, he's off his meds. I mean, he's off his meds. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7692.66s)]
*  Exactly. And to return to the mass shooter thing for a minute, like, you know, this is just [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7696.5s)]
*  total speculation on my part, but obviously, like, the narrative is often like, oh, these [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7702.02s)]
*  were mentally ill people who were untreated. That's why they committed this violence. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7708.580000000001s)]
*  I can't help but wonder. I mean, I think in the case of James Holmes, I know in his journals, [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7714.820000000001s)]
*  I can't- He complained about being on psych meds. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7719.620000000001s)]
*  And how weird they made him feel. So it's like, did he stop them cold turkey? Because [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7722.660000000001s)]
*  he was like, I don't like how I feel. I mean, I'm just speculating. I'm just- I'm truly asking [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7727.3s)]
*  that question from a place of curiosity. But people assume if you're off your meds, like, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7732.66s)]
*  that's your illness. Whatever you're doing is because you're mentally ill. It's never like, [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7738.900000000001s)]
*  oh, because you're in acute withdrawal. And I think my hope is that, especially now with [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7742.5s)]
*  the growing awareness, just more broadly in our society about the ways we've been betrayed by [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7749.860000000001s)]
*  medical authorities, I think more and more people, the 66 million people on these drugs, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7755.7s)]
*  more of them are going to realize they might want to pursue a different path for themselves. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7763.62s)]
*  And my fear is that they won't know about dependence and how important it is to taper slowly. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7768.5s)]
*  They'll come off too fast. And it will be like, talk about a crisis. I mean, I have friends who [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7775.62s)]
*  came off like antidepressants, for example, basically in a couple of weeks, because that's [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7783.46s)]
*  what they were told to do. They were bedridden. Like one friend I'm thinking of in particular, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7788.74s)]
*  she had been on an antidepressant and a benzo, always taken as prescribed for work-related [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7793.7s)]
*  anxiety. She went to a detox facility. She wanted to come off of them. They ripped her off in two [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7798.98s)]
*  weeks. And she was bedridden for like two years because every time she stood up, she would have [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7805.78s)]
*  vertigo and she'd like fall over. She couldn't stand, let alone walk to her car, let alone drive [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7811.46s)]
*  for like two years. She had to move in with her. She was like 40 years old. She was like [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7818.18s)]
*  moving with her parents. That's just one of like hundreds of thousands of maybe that's like at [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7821.7s)]
*  least a hundred thousand stories online of people who didn't have this information from their [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7828.02s)]
*  doctors, came off too fast, often at their doctor's instruction, because the doctors have no [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7834.58s)]
*  you are taught how to put people on these drugs, not how to get them off. And so people often only [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7841.9400000000005s)]
*  figure this out after the fact when they're already destabilized and withdrawal, not knowing what the [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7848.58s)]
*  hell is happening to them, freaking out. And then they start Googling. And then they find this [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7853.38s)]
*  online community of like, at this point, like thousands of Facebook groups and online forums, [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7858.18s)]
*  they find our nonprofit InterCompass Initiative. They start to learn about what they just did. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7863.78s)]
*  And they're like, Oh my God, I had no idea. Sometimes people recover from withdrawal within [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7869.46s)]
*  weeks or months. Sometimes it takes years. It took years for me really. And because I had a family [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7875.46s)]
*  again, who could provide for me, like I made it through. But I often think about how many people [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7883.06s)]
*  don't have the resources that I had access to. I'm like, I wouldn't have survived this if I didn't [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7888.58s)]
*  have a family who could literally provide for me because I could not function. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7894.98s)]
*  And 66 million people are on this stuff. Like this is a real crisis. This is the real crisis [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7900.66s)]
*  here that we need to be talking about. Oh, that's a horrifying story. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7908.259999999999s)]
*  How long did it take you to recover? [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7916.42s)]
*  The first year, I would say it was like every day was hell. Showering was a success. Like if I took [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7919.46s)]
*  a shower, I'm like, I had a really good day. I ended up living with my aunt and uncle for almost [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7926.18s)]
*  a year. They opened their home to me as I went on this journey. And everyone was scared because [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7933.38s)]
*  everyone in my family believed I had this serious brain disease and someone with diabetes needs [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7942.1s)]
*  insulin. That whole thing, she could die. But God bless my aunt and uncle. They just let me be [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7946.740000000001s)]
*  a mess. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7957.700000000001s)]
*  You have a very nice family. They sound like nice people. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7958.740000000001s)]
*  I'm really, really lucky. I mean, so many people who would want the same things that I wanted [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7963.0599999999995s)]
*  with getting off these drugs do not have anything like a supportive family. I'm so lucky. I really [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7976.42s)]
*  would not be here. I would literally be dead. And so I lived with them for basically a year. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7984.099999999999s)]
*  I was super active in AA at that time because I had quit drinking. Thank God for AA. I went to [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7990.34s)]
*  meetings every morning and every night. I didn't even realize at the time that most of my struggles [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=7998.18s)]
*  were because I was in cold turkey withdrawal because I came off five drugs in six months, [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8004.26s)]
*  which is like cold turkey. That would have shocked me if you told me that was cold turkey. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8008.74s)]
*  Like, what do you mean? It took half a year. I would just go to AA meetings and I was so messed [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8017.06s)]
*  up. I was so paranoid and insecure and I couldn't talk. I felt like I couldn't articulate myself. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8023.22s)]
*  I was such a mess. But I had a meeting every morning and every night. I didn't even realize [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8032.900000000001s)]
*  it was withdrawal for a while. It didn't matter. Just being able to talk to other people about [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8039.22s)]
*  the most vulnerable, painful parts of my daily reality. What a gift. I'm so grateful for AA. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8046.18s)]
*  I would say around a year off, I started to feel less shitty. Between years one and three, [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8055.14s)]
*  I progressively felt better physically, especially cognitively, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8063.9400000000005s)]
*  emotionally. By year three, when I look back, I'm like that was the year when I came alive again. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8072.9s)]
*  I would actually have these like, these are my fingers. I'm real. I'm here. Oh my God, [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8082.26s)]
*  that's the sun. That's the sun. It feels warm on my cheek. Literally at that level of like, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8090.42s)]
*  like I exist. It was like so profound. I hadn't realized that I hadn't been, [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8095.7s)]
*  I didn't know what I had been missing. You know what I mean? It's like, [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8104.58s)]
*  because my whole adult life, I've been under the influence of these drugs. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8109.139999999999s)]
*  It took me a long time. What I will say is that very early on, I found my purpose though. Even [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8113.7s)]
*  though I was super fucked up in withdrawal, I started blogging about my experiences basically [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8121.06s)]
*  right after I, right at the end of finishing coming off the drugs because I had reached out [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8129.620000000001s)]
*  that author, that journalist who wrote that Robert Whitaker, who wrote that book that had [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8135.3s)]
*  sparked my aha moment. I had reached out to him and had asked if I could write for his website [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8140.580000000001s)]
*  because I was like, you know, I grew up psychiatrized. I have no idea who I am. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8147.62s)]
*  Can I write about what this whole thing has been like? And he said, sure. So I started blogging [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8152.099999999999s)]
*  very early about what I was going through and began hearing from people like all over the world. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8160.74s)]
*  This was 2010. So this was like not a commonly talked about thing online. Like most people then [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8167.46s)]
*  were like, I love my meds. I've embraced my diagnoses. And here I was being like, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8173.7s)]
*  I'm an ex-mental patient. What the fuck just happened back there? And so I just realized [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8178.42s)]
*  so early on and God, I'm so grateful. What I went through actually has value. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8185.46s)]
*  And if I take, it wasn't wasted time, wasn't fruitless suffering, meaningless suffering. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8192.02s)]
*  This meant something. This means something. And if I put myself out there in the world [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8200.98s)]
*  and the more open I am about it, the more of a chance I'll have at actually helping others. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8208.74s)]
*  Even though I was super fucked up and withdrawal for a while, I was living. I was connecting. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8219.54s)]
*  And it was like, what a gift. I mean, at this point now, it's like thousands and thousands of [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8228.02s)]
*  people have either emailed me or I've met them at conferences. To me, the one takeaway from my book, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8233.86s)]
*  from my story that I want every struggling person to leave with, if I could leave them with one [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8244.580000000002s)]
*  thing, is like, your suffering means something. It is so much more than just faulty brain pathology, [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8250.5s)]
*  which is bullshit, first of all, not even true. But it's not wasted time. All is not lost. What [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8256.26s)]
*  you've been through might actually be the medicine that another person needs. And I'm so grateful [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8262.58s)]
*  for all of it. I wouldn't change a minute of any of it because this is my purpose. This is what [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8272.18s)]
*  makes me cry. This is what I'm here to do. It's just literally just talk about how hard it is [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8279.300000000001s)]
*  to be alive. And just the power of the stories that we tell ourselves about what it means to [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8285.939999999999s)]
*  be human. Because that's really all I've done. I've just changed the story. I let go of this [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8294.82s)]
*  bullshit medicalized, pharmaceuticalized story that I grew up believing in. And I'm like, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8300.74s)]
*  I've found my way to an actually human one. Life is hard. Pain isn't something to run away from. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8309.62s)]
*  The best way to find your way to peace of mind is to get out of yourself. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8320.26s)]
*  And mutual aid and the fellowship of other human beings is so simple and oftentimes so powerful. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8326.820000000002s)]
*  To help you find your way through. Other people are the greatest gift. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8340.1s)]
*  Let me ask you one final question. So I think any person listening to this would conclude, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8344.740000000002s)]
*  this is what it means to recover. This is victory. Once was lost, now I'm found. This is the greatest [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8352.26s)]
*  story arc. How many of your professional psychiatric caregivers have called you to [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8358.58s)]
*  say congratulations? I'm so glad you're well. None of them. Okay. So that we're going to end [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8364.18s)]
*  on that Laura Delano, because that just kind of tells the whole story right there. Because it's [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8370.58s)]
*  not like you're in hiding and any, you know, you have an unusual name. Anyone who treated you is [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8374.74s)]
*  probably aware of how you are now. And anyone who's not thrilled by that is like serving darkness. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8380.34s)]
*  That's my view. But I'm thrilled by it. So thank you so much for doing this. Thanks for having me, [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8385.380000000001s)]
*  Tucker. Oh my gosh, the best. So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show on one [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8391.62s)]
*  level. That's not surprising. That's what they do. But on another level, it's shocking with [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8400.980000000001s)]
*  everything that's going on in the world right now, all the change taking place in our economy [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8404.980000000001s)]
*  and our politics with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now. Google has decided you should [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8409.300000000001s)]
*  have less information rather than more. And that is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8414.5s)]
*  about it? Well, we could whine about it. That's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8421.7s)]
*  we could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is true, [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8426.26s)]
*  not intentionally deceptive. The way to do that on YouTube, we think it's to subscribe to our [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8430.74s)]
*  channel. Subscribe, hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8435.86s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. So we hope [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8441.46s)]
*  that you'll do that. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdWKkyooCk&t=8447.06s)]
