# Kid Rock’s Secret to Success, What They Won’t Tell You About Donald Trump, and the Diddy Arrest
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg)
*  Thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=11.44s)]
*  I'm really glad to be here, I have to say. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=13.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  This is our 10th city and we're going coast to coast in the month of September on the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=24.24s)]
*  theory that it's a beautiful country and if you live here and plan to die here, you should [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=33.28s)]
*  see it and also on the theory that, you know, everything's censored but you can't censor [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  a live event. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=43.76s)]
*  So that has really... [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=44.76s)]
*  But of all the places we've been, and this is totally sincere, I am especially grateful [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  to be in Grand Rapids. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=52.58s)]
*  I have... [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=53.58s)]
*  I've been coming to Grand Rapids since I was a teenager. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=54.58s)]
*  I grew up... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=61.5s)]
*  I didn't hear what you said but I think I agree with you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=62.5s)]
*  And I grew up in a totally different part of the country, a beautiful part of the country [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=66.1s)]
*  but a much less wholesome part of the country. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  And I wound up dating a girl when I was 15, right after I turned 15, whose family was [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=73.98s)]
*  from Grand Rapids. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=78.62s)]
*  And so I have been coming here consistently for 40 years, initially trying to woo her, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=80.5s)]
*  make the sale. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=89.38s)]
*  It's a little harder than it was with girls where I grew up, but worth it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=90.38s)]
*  And I continue to think this is just one of the greatest places ever and that the... [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=98.26s)]
*  And I'll just be totally blunt with you since no one's listening, that the women Michigan [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  producers really are at a higher level. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=106.58000000000001s)]
*  I mean that, I mean that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=109.58000000000001s)]
*  Just the nicest, and the cutest if I can say, but just the nicest. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  If you're a married man in the state of Michigan, the chances that you've been barked at this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=120.7s)]
*  morning, very, very low, very low. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=124.7s)]
*  The chances that someone's just been really nice to you are incredibly high. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=127.9s)]
*  And so it's like wild that your state is run by like the worst women I've ever seen. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=135.34s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=140.1s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=145.94s)]
*  I remember telling my son when he was like eight, I was like, you have got to marry a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=148.5s)]
*  girl from Michigan. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=152.62s)]
*  You just have to. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=153.62s)]
*  It just works. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=155.1s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=156.1s)]
*  Hunting season, I'm going to be hunting for... [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=157.66s)]
*  Of course you are. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=159.22s)]
*  Who's understanding, kind, warm? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=161.22s)]
*  The best. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=165.74s)]
*  And so then I wake up one morning and I'm like, who is running that state? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=166.74s)]
*  And it really is kind of a metaphor for everything, really for the entire country. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=171.42s)]
*  If you read about Michigan, I mean I come here a lot because of all my wife's family [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=176.38s)]
*  here and all our friends here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=180.38s)]
*  And one of my favorite people in Michigan is going to be joining us in just a minute. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=181.86s)]
*  One of the great boosters of Michigan, trust me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=188.42s)]
*  I've been to a lot of places with Kid Rock and wherever he is, he is representing the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=191.66s)]
*  state of Michigan at full volume. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=197.38s)]
*  They ought to give him... [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=199.34s)]
*  The tourist bureau ought to give him a commission because he is the most loyal son the state [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=200.78s)]
*  has ever produced. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=206.02s)]
*  But anyway, if you read about the state, you're like, wow, that place is really screwed up. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=207.02s)]
*  And then you come here and you don't meet a single person who is capable of screwing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=213.46s)]
*  up anything. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=218.14s)]
*  You don't meet a single... [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=219.8s)]
*  Every single person you meet in the state of Michigan is kind and straightforward and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=221.78s)]
*  nice and loves his family and musky fishing and like all the good things. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=224.86s)]
*  Loves walleye, you know? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  It's like, who are all these people who are allowing someone like Gretchen Whitmer or [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  Dana Nestle? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=241.9s)]
*  Like, who actually voted for Dana Nestle? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=242.9s)]
*  I always wonder that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=246.9s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=248.9s)]
*  There's like nobody. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=249.94s)]
*  It was like Bill de Blasio in New York, the city of 8 million people. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=250.94s)]
*  You couldn't find a single one who admitted voting for the guy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=255.1s)]
*  And he got... [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=259.22s)]
*  You may not even know who that is, but he was a spectacularly stupid mayor that they [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=260.22s)]
*  had. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=263.38s)]
*  This is really just unbelievable. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=264.38s)]
*  Like Whitmer, but without the facelift. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  But like Whitmer, it's totally right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=271.7s)]
*  I'll never forget during COVID, because I've been a booster of your state and I can do [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=275.38s)]
*  like I can point on my hand where things are and I know what the UP is and like I am kind [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=279.74s)]
*  of an adopted son of the state. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=285.54s)]
*  I've shot a bunch of your birds. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=289.78s)]
*  I've caught a ton of your fish. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=291.38s)]
*  I married one of your girls. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=292.94s)]
*  Like I am basically from Michigan. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=294.42s)]
*  I remember someone saying to me once like the governor of Michigan Gretchen something, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  who I think is actually from Grand Rapids area, amazingly, banned the sale of paint [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=306.66s)]
*  in paint stores. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  I'll never forget this during COVID. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=314.02000000000004s)]
*  And I was like, that's obviously an urban myth. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=315.70000000000005s)]
*  That's a legend. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=319.3s)]
*  That's like they're eating the pets in Springfield, Ohio. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=320.3s)]
*  That's not really true. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=322.66s)]
*  That can't be true. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=324.18s)]
*  They're not really eating the pets. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=326.98s)]
*  Actually they are. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=330.26s)]
*  She can't really have banned the sale of paint. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=332.66s)]
*  Is paint a well-known vector for Chinese viruses? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=336.86s)]
*  What? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=339.86s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=340.86s)]
*  I know Michigan. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=342.70000000000005s)]
*  And what? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=343.86s)]
*  And seeds. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=345.54s)]
*  Yeah, no planting flowers during a global pandemic. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=346.54s)]
*  You knew that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=350.62s)]
*  That's just like basic epidemiology. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=351.62s)]
*  So I remember saying clearly something has been lost in the translation that's not really [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=356.3s)]
*  real. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=359.66s)]
*  She didn't really do that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=360.66s)]
*  Because I want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, obviously. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=362.58s)]
*  No one's that stupid. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=365.42s)]
*  And then you wouldn't like keep everyone in the state indoors, but let your husband go [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  off to your cottage and go fishing at a boat rental that was closed to everybody else. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=371.82s)]
*  Like you wouldn't do that, would you? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=377.1s)]
*  Because that would really just be like giving the finger to the entire state to the people [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  who vote for you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=383.54s)]
*  And then you look it up and you're like, actually, like the pet eating, totally true. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=386.16s)]
*  And so then the question arises, well, how did this happen? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  So we learned two things, okay? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=394.88000000000005s)]
*  The first thing is the leaders of a place, whether it's a state or a town or a country, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=396.8s)]
*  do not necessarily reflect the people they lead or who live there at all. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=402.72s)]
*  In other words, you can have a place that's amazing, that's great on every level. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=406.92s)]
*  That's incredibly beautiful, as this state genuinely is. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=413.8s)]
*  You could have like the best people in the entire country and they can be led by like [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  a brain dead robot who bans paint sales in the name of COVID protection. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=420.6s)]
*  Like that happens. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  You can't judge a place by its leaders, which itself is a kind of challenge to the idea [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  of a constitutional republic or a democracy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=432.92s)]
*  Because of course, the core idea is the people rule. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=436.36s)]
*  It's their country. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=439.8s)]
*  It's their city. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=440.8s)]
*  It's their states or neighborhood. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=441.8s)]
*  It's their nation. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=443.12s)]
*  And the people who run it aren't kings or queens or arch dukes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=445.64s)]
*  They're not even a military junta. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=450.56s)]
*  It's just a bunch of ordinary people who are serving at the pleasure of the population. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=452.52s)]
*  They're the employees. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  It's like you're a housekeeper, but maybe less talented, but still your employee. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=459.12s)]
*  And if you catch them stealing or being creepy, you can just can them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=465.0s)]
*  Sorry, you work for me. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=469.24s)]
*  Out of here, honey. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=470.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=472.24s)]
*  Learn to paint houses. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=473.24s)]
*  So how could it be that leaders don't reflect the essential character of a place that's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=478.0s)]
*  anti-democratic? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=484.36s)]
*  I mean, in other words, when you come to Michigan, if the democracy is functioning as intended, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=485.36s)]
*  you would expect to find millions upon millions of little Gretchen Whitmer's dumb people [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=491.08s)]
*  with facelifts saying nonsensical things. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=496.8s)]
*  But that's the opposite of what you find. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=500.72s)]
*  So what does that tell you? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=503.44s)]
*  It tells you the system is not working as intended. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=504.44s)]
*  Okay? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=507.96s)]
*  So that's the first thing you learn. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=508.96s)]
*  And the second thing you learn is that there's a reason for that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=512.16s)]
*  And that's that people who are not with the program may be mad, but they're not actually [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=516.24s)]
*  voting. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=520.44s)]
*  They're not actually voting. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=521.94s)]
*  Now why is that? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=523.76s)]
*  Well, I think I know. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=524.76s)]
*  And I'm not here to scold anybody. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=526.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, trust me, there have been many times where I'm like, I know the people running [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=528.28s)]
*  for office a little bit too well to vote for them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=531.64s)]
*  Or you just feel like, what does it matter? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=535.24s)]
*  The system is fake. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=537.88s)]
*  Obviously, in 2020, you never saw a single Joe Biden. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=538.88s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't even exist, actually. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=542.68s)]
*  He's like a hologram at this point. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=544.64s)]
*  But in 2020, you're like, I never met a single person who's voting for, quote, Joe Biden. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=547.52s)]
*  And he got like over a billion votes. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=552.76s)]
*  He got more votes, or maybe more than that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=555.9599999999999s)]
*  I think he got more votes in the population of the Earth. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=557.84s)]
*  And you're like, you look at that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=562.72s)]
*  And oh, don't say fake. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=565.32s)]
*  That's not allowed. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=567.0s)]
*  By the way, that's not on Wikipedia. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=568.0s)]
*  Wikipedia says it was totally on the level. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=569.0s)]
*  Therefore, it must be. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=570.76s)]
*  To this day, if you go on a Google product, YouTube, you're not allowed to question the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=572.96s)]
*  last election, which is usually a sign. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=579.44s)]
*  Whenever someone tells you you're not allowed to have an opinion, it's pretty near proof [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=582.84s)]
*  that that opinion is true. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=587.72s)]
*  They're not banning lies in this country, trust me. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  There's no penalty for lying. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=593.96s)]
*  Most of the time, someone got busted for lying. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=597.2s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=598.88s)]
*  That's no longer a crime. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=601.44s)]
*  They lie to you from the podium every single day. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=602.44s)]
*  The Biden administration's illiterate spokesperson, you can't understand what she's saying. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  But you can be certain because her lips are moving that all of it is untrue, but she will [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=609.7s)]
*  never be held to account. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=612.52s)]
*  Tony Fauci still has a Secret Service detail. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=614.56s)]
*  Do you have? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=618.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, boo. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=619.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  The only people protecting him should be prison guards. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, honestly. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=624.4s)]
*  Yeah, boo. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=625.4s)]
*  Boo is right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=626.4s)]
*  So obviously there's no penalty for lying. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=632.1199999999999s)]
*  So if they're telling you you can't say something, take it to the bank, bet your house what you're [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  saying is true. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  That's why they hate it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=641.04s)]
*  Because it's a threat to their lives. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=642.9599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=645.12s)]
*  So, I mean, this is all very obvious. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=646.12s)]
*  You don't need to be a political scientist or a college graduate, you know, which I'm [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=647.9599999999999s)]
*  not to understand the basic dynamics in life, which is honest people are not afraid of different [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=650.88s)]
*  opinions. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=657.28s)]
*  They're not afraid of your opinion. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=658.28s)]
*  The only people who are afraid of talking are people with something to hide. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=660.04s)]
*  And what they're afraid of is that you might expose them. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=664.68s)]
*  That's of course exactly why they hate Trump. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=668.24s)]
*  It has nothing to do with his program. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=669.96s)]
*  Trump's like the least radical person in the world. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=672.16s)]
*  Trump's like completely moderate, actually. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=675.0s)]
*  But that's not what they care about. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=677.0s)]
*  What they care about is Trump's irrepressible tendency to say things that are not on the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=679.96s)]
*  script. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=684.16s)]
*  They don't trust Trump not to tell the truth. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=686.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, you can write a 10,000 word speech for Trump, but you can't be certain that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=690.0s)]
*  right in the middle of it, you won't be like, and another thing, and then tell the truth [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=693.04s)]
*  about you. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=695.8s)]
*  So if you're trying to hide something really, really obvious, like, I don't know, you murdered [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=696.8s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein or something, as if nobody knows, really, Epstein didn't kill himself? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=713.0799999999999s)]
*  Everybody already knows that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=714.0799999999999s)]
*  But the people who did it are really worried and did a million other things. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=716.4799999999999s)]
*  Oh, it wasn't safe and effective? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=719.76s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=722.76s)]
*  They're worried that Trump will just go off script and tell the truth. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=725.12s)]
*  They are not worried. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=727.1600000000001s)]
*  They're always like, oh, Trump's such a liar. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=728.1600000000001s)]
*  He's such a liar. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=729.1600000000001s)]
*  He bragged about his crowd size or his hands. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=731.5200000000001s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=733.6s)]
*  That's not why you hate Trump. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=735.0s)]
*  If he was a liar, you'd love him. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=738.0s)]
*  You'd vote for him. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=740.0s)]
*  No. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=742.0s)]
*  You're worried that he will accidentally tell the truth about you. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=743.6400000000001s)]
*  And so, sorry, speaking of getting far afield. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=748.88s)]
*  And so, you know, you're not allowed to question the 2020 election, but I think just like you're [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=755.8s)]
*  not allowed to question the COVID-vax, what else are you not allowed to question? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=759.8s)]
*  I can't hear you. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=763.68s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=764.68s)]
*  I'm not endorsing that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=766.04s)]
*  Just like you can't question, you know, human-caused climate change or whatever you can't question. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=769.52s)]
*  You can't question for a reason. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=774.52s)]
*  Boy, this is a sporty crowd. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=777.76s)]
*  Go Grand Rapids. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=781.64s)]
*  I love it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=785.2s)]
*  But people don't vote because they look at all of this. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=789.04s)]
*  They're like, you know, what's the point? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=792.36s)]
*  The system is fake. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=793.52s)]
*  They do think that. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=795.18s)]
*  I find myself feeling that way at times. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=796.18s)]
*  Well, of course it's fake. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=798.88s)]
*  But it doesn't mean your vote doesn't matter. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=800.56s)]
*  It doesn't mean you couldn't overwhelm them to such a degree they couldn't steal it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=802.86s)]
*  You could, actually. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=808.14s)]
*  And especially now. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=811.14s)]
*  Because something wild is happening that nobody is talking about. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=813.82s)]
*  And I almost never talk about politics because it, well, I don't know that much about it, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=816.78s)]
*  to be completely honest. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=820.1800000000001s)]
*  Having spent my life around it, I understand it less than I ever have. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=822.58s)]
*  I couldn't tell you how many electoral votes your state has, you know, just being honest. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=826.1800000000001s)]
*  20? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=830.78s)]
*  16? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=831.78s)]
*  Okay, that sounds about right. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=833.6999999999999s)]
*  16, okay. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=834.6999999999999s)]
*  So there are political experts here. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=835.6999999999999s)]
*  But here's what I notice. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=838.8199999999999s)]
*  If you get it, one of the reasons I don't get too into the weeds or the facts of electoral [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=840.18s)]
*  politics is sometimes it obscures the bigger picture. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=844.18s)]
*  And the bigger picture, as far as I'm concerned, just as an observer of it and as someone who's [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=847.38s)]
*  traveled across the country in the last few weeks, is that there is some kind of weird [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=851.38s)]
*  and huge realignment going on. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=855.4599999999999s)]
*  Massive realignment going on. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=857.86s)]
*  It's not your imagination at all. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=861.74s)]
*  I mean, Kid Rock's coming up on stage. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=863.74s)]
*  I mean, the guy, entertainers didn't used to do stuff like this before crowds like this. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=866.34s)]
*  Two nights ago, we had Bobby Kennedy on. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=874.1800000000001s)]
*  And I've always liked Bobby Kennedy because he's a sportsman, you know, he's an outdoorsman. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=879.54s)]
*  He's a hunter and a fisherman, you know, and I like people like that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=887.22s)]
*  That's more important to me. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=890.1s)]
*  But Bobby Kennedy was always like a liberal partisan Democrat. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=892.98s)]
*  Actually, his name is Bobby Kennedy. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=895.74s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=899.14s)]
*  And so, you know, I never thought I'd wind up in a place where he had vigorously, in [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=902.06s)]
*  a heartfelt way, endorsed Donald Trump, was promising to work as a part of the Trump administration, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=907.22s)]
*  help with the transition, become a cabinet secretary, all of which I hope happens, and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=914.5799999999999s)]
*  then be greeted by a crowd of people who are probably going to vote for Trump as a hero. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=918.18s)]
*  What? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=923.8599999999999s)]
*  And what does that tell you? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=924.8599999999999s)]
*  It's not just about Bobby Kennedy, who I think is an extraordinary and an incredibly brave [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=928.66s)]
*  person. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=933.14s)]
*  It tells you that the categories that we've grown up with and that have been used to describe [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=934.2199999999999s)]
*  what's happening in our country are lies. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=938.5s)]
*  And they're designed to mislead us about the truth. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=941.3s)]
*  And what they're designed to convey is the idea that the country is much more divided [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=945.74s)]
*  than it actually is. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=949.62s)]
*  That's what I notice. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=951.82s)]
*  If I experience what's happening in America on my phone, which unfortunately I do, I live [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=953.3s)]
*  at the other end of the country in a really rural area, and I don't know what's going [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=958.3s)]
*  on in America, so I like to look at my stupid phone, and I see an unending litany of sad [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=961.22s)]
*  stories about how much Americans hate each other. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=966.66s)]
*  You know, on the basis of politics, especially on the basis of race, but gender, too, men [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=969.58s)]
*  women hate each other, black people, white people hate each other, Democrats, Republicans [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=973.54s)]
*  hate each other, it's all a bunch of hate. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=976.42s)]
*  And then you get actually out into the country, and I don't know where that's taking place, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=978.46s)]
*  but nowhere I've been, this is my 10th city, no one has ever come up to me, not one time, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=981.62s)]
*  and been like, I hate you for your skin color, or you hate me for your skin color, I hate [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=986.7s)]
*  you for your, no one ever says anything like that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=990.9399999999999s)]
*  Everybody's really nice. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=993.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't know where all the hateful people are. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=994.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I do know they exist. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=995.8199999999999s)]
*  I guess they're all in the Biden administration. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=996.8199999999999s)]
*  But they don't seem to be wandering around the strip malls of America, the coffee shops, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1001.3s)]
*  or the hotel lobbies, or all the places I've been. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1005.14s)]
*  I never meet them at the airport. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1007.34s)]
*  Occasionally, if I go skiing in Jackson, Wyoming, and there are a lot of rich ladies waiting [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1009.8199999999999s)]
*  in the lift line. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1014.86s)]
*  If you're at the Maneji Moose, no, that Maneji Moose is fine, but if you go into the Four [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1015.86s)]
*  Seasons for the Elk Chili, there's always some angry woman with a facelift, like mad [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1020.06s)]
*  at you, ah, racist! [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1024.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1027.06s)]
*  So there's like one hundredth of the population who are super, super unhappy, possibly having [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1028.74s)]
*  an affair with the yoga instructor, who are married to finance guys who are really, really [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1034.74s)]
*  angry, not possibly, certainly, and they're really angry, but I don't see that anywhere [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1039.78s)]
*  else, ever. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1045.78s)]
*  And so then you think, well, wait a second, if the experience that I have wandering around [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1048.1s)]
*  the country I was born in bears no resemblance to what I'm told, then maybe that's not the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1051.46s)]
*  only lie they're telling me. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1055.74s)]
*  And maybe most people do not hate each other, despite the best efforts of the people running [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1058.38s)]
*  the country to make them hate each other. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1065.2s)]
*  For like sixty years. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1067.94s)]
*  All of American history, taught from elementary school through postgraduate, is designed to [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1071.7s)]
*  make you think that Americans hate each other on the basis of race. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1077.54s)]
*  That's the whole point of it. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1081.38s)]
*  I'm not going to use the naughty word you just used, but I endorse it completely. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1083.78s)]
*  It was a synonym for false, and that's exactly what it is. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1087.8600000000001s)]
*  It's false. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1090.8200000000002s)]
*  That is not true. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1092.66s)]
*  But you think about it for a second, it's like, why would they be telling you that? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1094.42s)]
*  And then you think about the sort of person who would want a population to hate each other. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1098.46s)]
*  And that's like the darkest thing you could ever want for people. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1104.7s)]
*  And if you're a parent, you know that. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1107.54s)]
*  If you're a parent, the most important thing to you is that your children love each other. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1109.6s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1115.3999999999999s)]
*  Because they're your children. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1117.72s)]
*  You're in charge of them. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  And when you die, all you leave behind, all that remains of your family, all that exists [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1121.76s)]
*  of your life is the love between your children. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1128.62s)]
*  That's where your memory lives, is in the love that they have for each other. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1132.12s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1137.04s)]
*  That's the most natural thing. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1138.04s)]
*  You don't need to have read a parenting book or be Dr. Spock to want something like that. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1140.12s)]
*  You just have to be a normal human being with a normal love for people. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1144.84s)]
*  And that's true, by the way, for leaders of all organizations, from the family, the smallest [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1149.76s)]
*  to most important, to the workplace, to the military unit, to the state, to the country. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1153.8s)]
*  Leaders, decent leaders, normal leaders, want the people they lead to love each other. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1159.08s)]
*  Only a sick and evil leader would intentionally sow hatred between the people he leads. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1164.88s)]
*  Period. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1171.2800000000002s)]
*  That's not political. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1172.8000000000002s)]
*  That's not wrong. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1175.5200000000002s)]
*  That is evil. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1176.88s)]
*  That's the definition of evil. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1177.88s)]
*  Inspiring people to hate each other is the definition of evil. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1180.24s)]
*  There is no clearer sign. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1184.64s)]
*  And by the way, that's so unnatural that it's supernatural. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1186.5200000000002s)]
*  That's exactly what that is. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1190.96s)]
*  You are acting on behalf of unnatural forces if you are convincing the people you lead [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1192.68s)]
*  to hate each other. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1197.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's exactly what your governor and particularly your attorney general, Dana Nestle, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1198.3600000000001s)]
*  are doing in this state. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1202.6000000000001s)]
*  And that's what the Biden administration is doing. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1203.6000000000001s)]
*  It's what all of our leaders are doing and have been for a long time. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1205.48s)]
*  And it's not working. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1207.96s)]
*  That's the crazy thing. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1210.3600000000001s)]
*  I haven't always been proud of the companies that have advertised on shows I've had over [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1211.3600000000001s)]
*  the years. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  But now that we have our own company, we decided, well, we're only going to take ads from people [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1216.1200000000001s)]
*  we like and agree with and admire. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1219.8200000000002s)]
*  So it is with actual pride that we announce partnership with Bass Pro Shops. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1222.24s)]
*  You know Bass Pro Shops. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1227.52s)]
*  You can get everything you need for hunting, fishing, enjoying the outdoors at Bass Pro. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1229.04s)]
*  And we do. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1233.54s)]
*  What you might not know is if for over 50 years Bass Pro has been a leader in conservation [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1234.54s)]
*  efforts throughout the continent. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1239.68s)]
*  Bass Pro is led by our friend, Johnny Morris. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1242.24s)]
*  He's the visionary founder. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1244.4s)]
*  Visionary is not too strong, by the way, of that company. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1246.2s)]
*  And he's put conservation at the core of their mission from the very first day. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1248.66s)]
*  And by conservation, we're not talking about some weird theoretical climate scheme. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1252.02s)]
*  We're talking about preserving the natural landscape, preserving the land, the natural [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1256.66s)]
*  resources that we inherited created by God. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1262.7s)]
*  So for the last decade, Bass Pro is average giving back more than 10% of their earnings [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1265.42s)]
*  to conservation and advancing their mission, a critical mission of introducing people to [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1269.7s)]
*  the outdoors, getting them away from screens into God's great nature, advocating for the [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1275.1s)]
*  rights of sportsmen and conserving wildlife and habitat, which is essential. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1280.98s)]
*  You hunter fish, you know. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1286.3s)]
*  So customers are invited to round up their purchases in store and online to support Bass [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1287.9399999999998s)]
*  Pro Shops and Cabela's Outdoor Fund, which gets invested directly with conservation projects [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1292.82s)]
*  and organizations in the communities they serve. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1298.1799999999998s)]
*  It's all real. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1300.86s)]
*  So rounding up that little bit of pocket change adds up over time, particularly with [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1302.22s)]
*  a big company like Bass Pro, and it makes a big difference. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1305.82s)]
*  So stop into your nearest Bass Pro Shops or Cabela's to gear up for all your outdoor pursuits, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1309.18s)]
*  hunting, fishing, being outside. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1313.42s)]
*  And while you're there, we recommend rounding up for conservation. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1315.78s)]
*  It doesn't appear to be working. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1319.02s)]
*  If Americans believe the things they hear about each other in their country, they would [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1323.02s)]
*  have been in a permanent race war like 50 years ago. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1328.26s)]
*  You wouldn't be able to drive from New York to Los Angeles. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1332.18s)]
*  There'd be roadblocks of people with guns. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1334.5s)]
*  It'd be Lebanon. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1336.7s)]
*  But it's the opposite of that. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1337.7s)]
*  And so that tells you just once again that the country itself, which means its people [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1340.9s)]
*  and its dogs. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1346.5800000000002s)]
*  Dogs are a reflection of the people and we have the best dogs. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1350.38s)]
*  Heck yes. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1352.8600000000001s)]
*  We have the best dogs in the world. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1353.8600000000001s)]
*  We do. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1356.74s)]
*  We do. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1357.74s)]
*  The dogs do take on the characters of their owners. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1359.94s)]
*  That's true. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1363.3400000000001s)]
*  But the people of this country are loving good people who are being led by the worst [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1366.18s)]
*  people who've ever led a country. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1372.18s)]
*  And that is just true. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1373.5800000000002s)]
*  I think that's true. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1374.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean it. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1375.8600000000001s)]
*  My loathing, my love of Americans and my loathing of their leaders deepens every day that we're [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1377.46s)]
*  on the road. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1383.1000000000001s)]
*  It really, really does because of the disconnect. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1384.1000000000001s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1386.28s)]
*  Well, you can vote. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1387.28s)]
*  I've never encouraged anyone to vote ever. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1388.36s)]
*  But I feel like in this state it's particularly important. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1390.56s)]
*  I'm not a political person. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1392.8s)]
*  I'm not here on behalf of a candidate. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1393.8s)]
*  Probably guess who I'm voting for. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1395.92s)]
*  I actually am voting this year. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1396.92s)]
*  I am. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1398.92s)]
*  I am. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1399.92s)]
*  But I do think people should vote in the state of Michigan because there's absolutely no [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1401.92s)]
*  reason you should be led by people who do not share the most basic values of the people [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1406.44s)]
*  of Michigan. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1412.8799999999999s)]
*  And I mean from, I always beat up on the East Coast of Michigan. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1413.8799999999999s)]
*  My wife is actually from the Detroit area. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1417.9s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1421.26s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1422.26s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1423.26s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1424.26s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1425.26s)]
*  And whenever I talk about Michigan I'm like there are actually two sides to it and the [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1426.26s)]
*  West Coast is way nicer. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1430.18s)]
*  But the truth is there are super nice people over there too and northern Michigan is just [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1435.8600000000001s)]
*  like a wonder. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1439.6200000000001s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1440.6200000000001s)]
*  And none of you deserve, none of you deserve your leaders. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1443.22s)]
*  None of you. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1446.1000000000001s)]
*  It's true. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1447.86s)]
*  Even the people who vote for them don't deserve them if I can just say. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1448.86s)]
*  You often hear we get the leaders we deserve. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1453.34s)]
*  That's a total lie. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1455.06s)]
*  No you don't. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1456.06s)]
*  No you don't. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1457.06s)]
*  And you see that around the world. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1458.4599999999998s)]
*  I've been in plenty of countries with horrible leaders. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1459.4599999999998s)]
*  Those people don't deserve them. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1461.62s)]
*  Nobody deserves leaders like that. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1462.6999999999998s)]
*  And so I did hear of something really cool today. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1465.7199999999998s)]
*  I've never done anything like this one. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1467.6999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to do it now. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1468.6999999999998s)]
*  There's actually a website in the state of Michigan where you can find people who probably [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1469.6999999999998s)]
*  would vote for the candidate you're voting for. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1475.1399999999999s)]
*  But don't vote. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1478.1s)]
*  And you can look them up. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1479.34s)]
*  The voter rules are right there. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1480.34s)]
*  It's called 10X votes. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1481.34s)]
*  And you can go on there and just contact people you know and be like hey by the way we don't [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1482.34s)]
*  deserve this. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1488.2199999999998s)]
*  These people are horrible. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1489.2199999999998s)]
*  And we're not horrible. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1490.2199999999998s)]
*  We're great. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1492.4199999999998s)]
*  And if you're frustrated with these people, even if you don't think the system works, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1494.5s)]
*  even if you think it's all fake, even if you think they're going to steal it in the end, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1497.2199999999998s)]
*  that's not exactly true. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1500.62s)]
*  You can overwhelm their malintent by your voting. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1502.3s)]
*  And at the very least you can give them the largest middle finger ever wagged in the face [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1506.22s)]
*  of anybody by voting against them. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1510.78s)]
*  I do think it's important. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1514.1s)]
*  That finger, the one you just waved. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1516.1399999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1518.34s)]
*  I'm not going to do that because it's wrong. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1520.3799999999999s)]
*  But I do love that gesture because it's just I don't trust I'm in the word business and [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1522.5s)]
*  I don't really trust words anymore. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1526.46s)]
*  I'm not going to do that. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1528.74s)]
*  Kid Rock's about to be here. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1530.06s)]
*  He literally has that painted on the tail of his plane. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1531.38s)]
*  And I'll let him explain who that's aimed at. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1538.1000000000001s)]
*  I can't. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1544.5s)]
*  If my Michigan born wife saw me hoisting the middle finger in front of some of her relatives [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1547.6200000000001s)]
*  who are in this room tonight, she would look at me with a pained face in that squeaky and [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1555.22s)]
*  adorable and honestly kind of sexy Michigan accent and say to me, that's not very nice. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1565.6200000000001s)]
*  My wife always says to me in her Michigan accent, you don't hate anybody. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1578.9s)]
*  I don't want to admit that actually I kind of do. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1585.02s)]
*  But anyway, so before I bring Kid Rock out, I would just I have we've actually thought [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1586.8600000000001s)]
*  about even moving here over the years. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1595.42s)]
*  And because that's how much I love it. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1597.26s)]
*  And maybe we will. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1603.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, who knows what's going to happen. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1604.3400000000001s)]
*  But if I lived here, I would just I would. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1605.38s)]
*  Can you imagine being governor of Michigan? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1611.74s)]
*  That would be. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1614.9s)]
*  That would be a hard job. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1621.7s)]
*  It would be so great, though. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1624.98s)]
*  I'm telling you, we would have walleye day if I. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1630.3400000000001s)]
*  But the two things I would keep in mind if I lived here, the two things I would keep [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1639.02s)]
*  in mind is that actually the people of your state are great. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1643.26s)]
*  Your state is great. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1648.46s)]
*  Your state is beautiful. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1649.58s)]
*  I would not let them tell you otherwise. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1650.7s)]
*  Even Detroit's a little better than they say. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1653.34s)]
*  I just had dinner there. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1655.18s)]

*  Whoa. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1767.04s)]
*  If you've ever trapped a raccoon in the garage with a broom. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1768.04s)]
*  No, I'm serious. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1771.76s)]
*  And like you go through life like, oh, raccoons are so cute and their little hands, they kind [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1775.32s)]
*  of have opposable thumbs and their little like rubber mask eyes and they're so cute. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1779.12s)]
*  Have you ever catch one in the garage eating dog food at night? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1784.76s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1787.96s)]
*  You realize this is a vicious animal. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1789.32s)]
*  It's bite your face off, right? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1791.56s)]
*  And you know from their eyes and Dana Nestle has those eyes. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1794.52s)]
*  So for Dana Nestle to be calling you crazy, are you joking? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1799.54s)]
*  No, you're not the crazy ones. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1803.36s)]
*  And that is the beauty of an event like this is you get to be in a room and you can feel [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1806.94s)]
*  it. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1811.84s)]
*  Even if you don't talk to anybody, you can feel the vibe. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1812.84s)]
*  Backstage, one of the people I traveled with from Maine said to me, do you feel the vibe [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1813.9199999999998s)]
*  out there with good people? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1818.3999999999999s)]
*  You can literally feel it. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1819.72s)]
*  And what that tells you is that the things that you want, like decent schools and roads [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1823.1999999999998s)]
*  without holes in them and the ability to walk to the grocery store without getting mugged [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1832.72s)]
*  and like an inflation rate that's under 12 percent and maybe a little cottage you share [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1837.52s)]
*  with your cousins up north, like just sort of normal things. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1843.52s)]
*  Maybe a little continuity. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1848.6s)]
*  Maybe the right to live in a state that's not completely different from the state you [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1850.66s)]
*  grew up in. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1854.22s)]
*  That's a right, actually. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1855.22s)]
*  They're always inventing rights. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1859.32s)]
*  You have a right to this. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1860.32s)]
*  You have a right to that, which usually means you're getting nothing. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1861.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1864.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1865.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware, baby. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1866.1200000000001s)]
*  And I'm aware. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1869.8s)]
*  And again, you use profanity, but I'm with you. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1871.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1874.0s)]
*  But there is a right that every person has, which is to be a little bit insulated from [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1875.0s)]
*  like having their state invaded and changed overnight, actually. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1881.2s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1884.12s)]
*  It's just true. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1885.12s)]
*  Like you shouldn't wake up in a place where you were born and not recognized. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1886.12s)]
*  Everything's totally different. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1891.0s)]
*  All the attitudes are different. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1892.0s)]
*  The people are different. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1893.0s)]
*  The economy is totally different. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1894.0s)]
*  That's like an act of violence against you, actually. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1896.04s)]
*  That's not the promise of America. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1898.72s)]
*  The promise of America is that things get a little better. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1900.16s)]
*  Not maybe radically better, but your kids have a shot at a little better life than you [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1903.2s)]
*  had. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1905.76s)]
*  That's the American dream. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1906.76s)]
*  The American dream is not that you wake up and like you don't even recognize this place [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1909.76s)]
*  and you know for a fact that your kids are not going to be going to the little cottage [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1915.1200000000001s)]
*  they share with their cousins up north. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1918.1200000000001s)]
*  They're not going to be able to afford a house. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1919.6000000000001s)]
*  That's the opposite of the American dream. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1922.8400000000001s)]
*  So I guess what I'm saying is what you want is totally sensible and moderate and reasonable [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1925.6s)]
*  and human and basic. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1932.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not crazy. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1935.56s)]
*  It's not asking for like a fleet of helicopters or free ice cream. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1937.1999999999998s)]
*  They're the free ice cream party. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1942.48s)]
*  You just kind of want to go to the grocery store without getting mugged or going broke. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1945.0s)]
*  And they tell you that you're insane because you're against like, I don't know, castrating [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1951.52s)]
*  children. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1955.52s)]
*  That's not insane. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1956.52s)]
*  They're insane. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1957.6s)]
*  So just look around. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1959.92s)]
*  Remember that. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1963.0s)]
*  Take heart. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1964.56s)]
*  You are not the freak. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1965.8s)]
*  Dana Nestle's the freak with sharp teeth and raccoon eyes. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1969.4s)]
*  Gretchen Whitmer is the freak with the facelift and the paint sales bands. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1975.8799999999999s)]
*  You're a freak, dude. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1982.1999999999998s)]
*  If you had a cousin like that growing up and she came over to Thanksgiving, people would [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1983.1999999999998s)]
*  talk very quietly around her because who knows, once she has a fork in her hand, who knows [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1987.32s)]
*  what she'll do with it? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1992.1599999999999s)]
*  Everybody has a relative like that. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1994.32s)]
*  How did yours become governor? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1995.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1997.1999999999998s)]
*  But don't let her convince you that she's the normal one. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=1999.06s)]
*  She's not. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2002.8s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2004.44s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2005.44s)]

*  I go, when's the last time you had a Twinkie? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2090.24s)]
*  I had one in 1987. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2095.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2097.7999999999997s)]

*  I'm like, I can't remember when the last time I had a Twinkie and no one else can either. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2102.16s)]

*  So great. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2143.24s)]
*  What do you think is going on with this election right now? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2145.2s)]
*  I think Trump's going to kick their ass, honestly. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2150.08s)]
*  It reminds me of 2016. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2157.2s)]
*  I literally went to bed like a lot of people that night, pulling for Trump on his team, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2161.4799999999996s)]

*  All the polls told you this. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2172.3999999999996s)]
*  They had you convinced if you looked at any television. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2173.76s)]
*  Like, there's no way. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2176.8s)]
*  He was a joke since he came down the elevator. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2178.44s)]
*  So were a lot of us that supported him since he came down that elevator and still been [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2181.96s)]
*  getting shit till this day, which is fine. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2185.6000000000004s)]

*  But it reminded me of that and then woke up the next morning like Trump won. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2189.8s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2193.6000000000004s)]

*  What's going on? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2205.64s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how you can look at this. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2206.64s)]
*  I mean, you said Oprah thing yesterday. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2208.6s)]
*  I did, but for those, I don't know how many faithful Oprah watchers we have in this room, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2212.0s)]
*  but tell us about it. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2217.96s)]
*  I think everybody's, I don't know, at least I didn't watch it, but I caught wind of it, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2222.48s)]
*  you know, the morning news and stuff. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2226.4s)]
*  It was a joke. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2229.0s)]
*  It was a complete joke. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2230.08s)]
*  Well, in the interview that you're referring to, Kamala Harris, like the big fact of the [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2232.4s)]
*  debate from my perspective was the fact that Kamala Harris owns a gun. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2237.08s)]
*  And yeah, but nobody has. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2242.88s)]
*  What? Why is she allowed to have a gun? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2244.24s)]
*  But nobody, not nobody that she's done her little interviews with or anything, it says. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2246.04s)]
*  What kind of gun do you own? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2251.56s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2252.68s)]
*  You know, just start there. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2254.28s)]

*  And then you got this ass. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2270.04s)]
*  I'd like to watch her clean it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2271.04s)]
*  And then while we're at it, then you got this ass clown, Tim Walsh, right? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2272.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2275.4399999999996s)]

*  They don't mess with the songwriter or a comedian. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2285.64s)]
*  So I'm listening to this guy and he honestly reminds me of like, I think of a few junior high and high school teachers and I absolutely hate it. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2289.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2296.84s)]

*  I'm right. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2302.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm right. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2302.84s)]
*  You know, I coach football, this, that and the other. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2303.84s)]
*  And then he's, you know, you know, wearing a camo hat. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2305.84s)]
*  Like I'm the best shot. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2308.2400000000002s)]
*  I like to hunt. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2309.84s)]
*  I'm a hunter. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2310.84s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, what do you hunt? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2311.84s)]
*  Cocks and dicks? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2313.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2316.44s)]
*  And I don't want to be unfair or whatever, but every time I see him talk, I think of that scene from Airplane where the pilot's like, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2317.84s)]
*  never seen a grown man naked, Johnny. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2324.84s)]
*  I'll tell you this much, that Tim Walsh has seen one up close, if you know what I mean. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2328.84s)]
*  I can't confirm or deny. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2335.84s)]
*  I told Trump actually, you know, we more have fun together. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2337.84s)]
*  I'm not the big policy guy. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2341.84s)]
*  I'm happy to give my opinion if asked or whatever, but you know, I'm not a political scientist. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2344.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm an average person when it comes in regards like that, like most people. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2349.04s)]
*  But, you know, we're always looking for, I like the fun name game, you know, this, that and the other. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2353.04s)]
*  And I was like, got something for Tim Walsh yet. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2358.44s)]
*  I was like, how about Tampon Timmy? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2361.04s)]
*  And I think even Trump said, that might be a little too far. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2365.04s)]
*  I got all sorts of them, you know. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2370.84s)]
*  I'm like, you know, one of his, my favorite policies of Trump is, you know, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2373.24s)]
*  without starting wars, it's, what do they call it again? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2378.24s)]
*  Strength through strength, peace through strength. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2383.24s)]
*  Peace through strength. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2386.24s)]
*  I think that's genius. Of course, if it was my policy, I'd call it, fuck around and find out. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2388.24s)]
*  I think it's a similar principle. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2394.24s)]
*  Most of us, well, actually all of us, go through our daily lives [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2397.24s)]
*  using all sorts of quote free technology without paying attention to why it's quote free. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2400.4399999999996s)]
*  Who's paying for this and how? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2406.4399999999996s)]
*  Think about it for a minute. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2408.4399999999996s)]
*  Think about your free email account, the free messenger system used to chat with your friends. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2410.4399999999996s)]
*  The free weather app or game app you open up and never think about. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2415.4399999999996s)]
*  It's all free. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2419.4399999999996s)]
*  But is it? No, it's not free. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2421.4399999999996s)]
*  These companies aren't developing expensive products and just giving them to you because they love you. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2424.4399999999996s)]
*  They're doing it because their programs take all your information. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2430.4399999999996s)]
*  They hoover up your data, private personal data, and sell it to data brokers and the government. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2433.4399999999996s)]
*  And all of those people who are not your friends are very interested in manipulating you [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2440.4399999999996s)]
*  and your personal political and financial decisions. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2445.4399999999996s)]
*  It's scary as hell. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2448.4399999999996s)]
*  And it's happening out in the open without anybody saying anything about it. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2450.4399999999996s)]
*  This is a huge problem. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2454.4399999999996s)]
*  And we've been talking about this problem to our friend, Eric Prince, for years. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2455.4399999999996s)]
*  He says, well, somebody needs to fix this. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2459.64s)]
*  And he and his partners have. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2461.64s)]
*  And now we're partners with them. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2463.64s)]
*  And their company is called Unplugged. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2465.64s)]
*  It's not a software company. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2467.64s)]
*  It's a hardware company. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2469.64s)]
*  They actually make a phone. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2471.64s)]
*  The phone is called Unplugged. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2473.64s)]
*  And it's more than that. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2475.64s)]
*  The purpose of the phone is to protect you from having your life stolen, your data stolen. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2477.64s)]
*  It's designed from a privacy first perspective. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2483.64s)]
*  It's got an operating system that they made. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2486.8399999999997s)]
*  It's called Messenger and other apps that help you take charge of your personal data [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2488.8399999999997s)]
*  and prevent it from getting passed around to data brokers and government agencies [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2491.8399999999997s)]
*  that will use it to manipulate you. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2495.8399999999997s)]
*  Unplugged's commitment is to its customers. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2497.8399999999997s)]
*  They will promise you and they mean it that your data are not being sold [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2500.8399999999997s)]
*  or monetized or shared with anyone. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2503.8399999999997s)]
*  From basics like its custom Libertas operating system, which they wrote, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2506.8399999999997s)]
*  which is designed from the very first day to keep your personal data on your device. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2510.8399999999997s)]
*  It also has, believe it or not, a true on-off switch that shuts off the power. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2516.04s)]
*  It actually disconnects your battery and ensures that your microphone and your camera [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2520.04s)]
*  are turned off completely when you want them to be. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2525.04s)]
*  So they're not spying on you and say your bedroom, which your iPhone is. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2528.04s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2532.04s)]
*  So it is a great way, one of the few ways, to actually protect yourself from big tech [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2534.04s)]
*  and big government to reclaim your personal privacy. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2538.04s)]
*  Without privacy, there is no freedom. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=2541.04s)]

*  A little different. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3131.24s)]
*  It's... [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3133.4399999999996s)]
*  So, you are in this business. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3135.4399999999996s)]
*  You've been in this business. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3139.4399999999996s)]
*  Entertainment, music, among artists your entire life. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3141.4399999999996s)]
*  And I bet there are some who agree with you. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3143.4399999999996s)]
*  But there are very, very few who've been as honest about having the views that you have. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3147.4399999999996s)]
*  Was that a tough decision? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3152.4399999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's got to be a decision. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3154.4399999999996s)]
*  You're in a business. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3156.4399999999996s)]
*  Why did you make that decision? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3158.4399999999996s)]
*  I mean, part of it was, you know, I got older and wiser. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3160.4399999999996s)]
*  But to be honest, I had the money in the bank. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3162.64s)]
*  And at the end of the day, when I really thought about it, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3166.64s)]
*  it sounds hokey, but I just care about this country too much. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3170.64s)]
*  And I said, you know, I kind of said, you know, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3182.64s)]
*  and it was a really conscious thing. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3184.64s)]
*  I just started kind of doing it, you know, getting involved. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3186.64s)]
*  And one thing led to another. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3188.64s)]
*  And it was like, you know, it was kind of, you know, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3190.8399999999997s)]
*  I had a couple of talks with just friends. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3192.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm not one of these people that has this big machine team, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3194.8399999999997s)]
*  have this big team around them where, you know, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3196.8399999999997s)]
*  clearly every tweet's not screened. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3198.8399999999997s)]
*  I picked up on that. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3202.8399999999997s)]
*  It comes out of my mouth, or the decisions I make. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3204.8399999999997s)]
*  I take responsibility for it all. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3206.8399999999997s)]
*  It's me. There's no filters in there. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3208.8399999999997s)]
*  But when it came, it was like, you know, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3210.8399999999997s)]
*  there's going to be no corporate deals to set any other. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3212.8399999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, good. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3214.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm like, I'm so sick of dealing with those. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3216.8399999999997s)]
*  I'll try not to curse so much, you know, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3220.8399999999997s)]
*  and the BS that goes on in these corporate things. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3222.8399999999997s)]
*  And I've only aligned myself with, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3224.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, things that Coors Light had to deal with them. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3226.8399999999997s)]
*  I had to deal with Jim Beam. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3228.8399999999997s)]
*  I had to deal with Harley Davidson and Chevy trucks. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3230.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like, these are all things that, you know, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3232.8399999999997s)]
*  I was involved in, but still, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3234.8399999999997s)]
*  even though I used all those things, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3236.8399999999997s)]
*  like dealing with the corporate bullshit, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3238.8399999999997s)]
*  I was like, yeah, if I never see that again, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3240.8399999999997s)]
*  I could care less. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3242.8399999999997s)]
*  And there's no amount of money on the face of this earth [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3244.8399999999997s)]
*  because I've turned down all the things [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3246.8399999999997s)]
*  that I've done on this earth, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3249.04s)]
*  because I've turned down tons of it [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3251.04s)]
*  that would ever get me to be vocal [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3253.04s)]
*  or be somebody I'm not, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3255.04s)]
*  and then people would see somebody different [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3257.04s)]
*  than who I really am. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3259.04s)]
*  I just got to say, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3261.04s)]
*  you make it sound easy. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3263.04s)]
*  I know a lot of people in your business, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3265.04s)]
*  in the entertainment business, obviously. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3267.04s)]
*  And they don't reach the same conclusion you did, actually. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3269.04s)]
*  I think it's a harder decision than you're admitting. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3271.04s)]
*  Like I said, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3273.04s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of the company. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3275.04s)]
*  Like I said, I had the money in the bank, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3278.04s)]
*  so it was, you know, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3280.04s)]
*  a lot of people don't want to mess with their bottom line. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3282.04s)]
*  A lot of people, anybody, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3284.04s)]
*  this goes for anybody, they don't, you know, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3286.04s)]
*  they're scared of their social standing. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3288.04s)]
*  God forbid mom drops off the kids at school [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3290.04s)]
*  with a MAGA hat on, you know what I mean? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3292.04s)]
*  You're like, oh, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3294.04s)]
*  you know, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3296.04s)]
*  all of a sudden, you know, you're this [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3298.04s)]
*  polarizing, you know, divisive person [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3300.04s)]
*  because you said, do I want to [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3302.04s)]
*  make America great again? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3304.04s)]
*  I was like, how dare you! [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3306.04s)]
*  You know, it's just, it's, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3310.04s)]
*  people are scared. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3312.04s)]
*  One thing, I've been a lot of things. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3314.04s)]
*  One thing I've never been is scared. That's for sure. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3316.04s)]
*  Amen. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3318.04s)]
*  So has it, do you, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3320.04s)]
*  do you think it has cost you? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3322.04s)]
*  No. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3326.04s)]
*  I was planning on it, probably, you know, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3328.04s)]
*  like, hey, you have the potential to give up [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3330.04s)]
*  a lot, and I'm like, I don't care. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3332.04s)]
*  I was like, whatever. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3334.04s)]
*  This tells me it's the right thing to do. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3336.04s)]
*  This is what my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3338.04s)]
*  tells me is the right thing to do. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3340.04s)]
*  And I'm going to follow my heart. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3344.04s)]
*  And, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3346.04s)]
*  you know, it's crazy because there's [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3348.04s)]
*  some times where it goes like this and it's, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3350.04s)]
*  you know, very vocal. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3352.04s)]
*  The last however many years and the last full [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3354.04s)]
*  tour I did a few years ago, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3356.04s)]
*  the only thing I did to promote it [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3358.04s)]
*  was the thing I did with you. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3360.04s)]
*  That was it. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3362.04s)]
*  Into one piece of present, we sold out every city [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3364.04s)]
*  on that tour. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3366.04s)]
*  And, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3368.04s)]
*  you know, it just goes to show you if, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3370.04s)]
*  if you speak your truths, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3372.04s)]
*  and I mean they have to be your truths, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3374.04s)]
*  that's something you heard, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3376.04s)]
*  not something you're repeating to get [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3378.04s)]
*  somewhere, to get to a certain stature, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3380.04s)]
*  but if it's really your truths, you, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3382.04s)]
*  your families, your friends, things you believe in, like, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3384.04s)]
*  good things will come. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3386.04s)]
*  That is [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3388.04s)]
*  where I love [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3390.04s)]
*  hearing you say that. I think it's true. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3392.04s)]

*  I don't [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3396.04s)]

*  Detroit, you know, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3400.04s)]
*  you know where I learned a lot of that? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3402.04s)]
*  When I was very young, I was like the [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3404.04s)]
*  white kid that hung out in [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3406.04s)]
*  the black areas. And I was a DJ [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3408.04s)]
*  and I breakdanced and all this stuff. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3410.04s)]
*  And I remember back then, like, if I [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3412.04s)]
*  would try to fit in, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3414.04s)]
*  like back then, wear like a troop suit [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3416.04s)]
*  and have on like this cool hip hop [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3418.04s)]
*  stuff. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3420.04s)]
*  What's a troop suit? Like LL Cool J used to wear. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3422.04s)]
*  It was this big thing in the 80s. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3424.04s)]
*  Like, there was some straight hip hop [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3426.04s)]
*  shit like, you know, and I was really this [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3428.04s)]

*  you know, I never thought I would have another [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3502.04s)]

*  you know, I'd die a Michigan resident. That's just [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3506.04s)]
*  the way it was. And, you know, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3508.04s)]

*  and been blessed. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3512.04s)]
*  My son, you know, he went to [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3514.04s)]
*  school, I raised him in Clarkston, Michigan. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3516.04s)]
*  He went to St. Orchard Lake, St. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3518.04s)]

*  went to college at a small Christian school [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3522.04s)]
*  called Belmont. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3524.04s)]
*  Had my granddaughter [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3526.04s)]

*  They eventually got married. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3530.04s)]
*  I have my second grandson now. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3532.04s)]
*  But [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3534.04s)]
*  after he finished college [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3536.04s)]
*  he was in Nashville for several months and I'm like, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3538.04s)]
*  I always had a condo down there, kind of like [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3540.04s)]
*  a little party house. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3542.04s)]
*  And it was no fun. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3544.04s)]

*  you know, masculine men, for example. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3763.04s)]

*  they've taken so much for granted. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3779.04s)]
*  I mean, look at Trump, had [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3781.04s)]
*  a lot of Democrats, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3783.04s)]

*  He was a big deal. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3789.04s)]
*  And then, you know, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3791.04s)]
*  you have to have a lot of [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3793.04s)]

*  Nazi. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3803.04s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3805.04s)]
*  And I think people get complacent. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3807.04s)]
*  They always do. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3809.04s)]
*  They don't vote for granted. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3811.04s)]
*  You just think these are like, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3813.04s)]
*  we don't have to say anything. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3815.04s)]
*  We're pro, and we're going to give you money. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3817.04s)]
*  It's the big pork thing in D.C. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3819.04s)]
*  When you hear Kamala Harris say that [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3827.04s)]
*  if the government [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3829.04s)]
*  knows you have a gun, they have the right [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3831.04s)]
*  to barge into your house and inspect it. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3833.04s)]
*  They can barge in, they're going out [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3837.04s)]
*  in a body bag. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3839.04s)]
*  Last time I checked, the Second Amendment [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3847.04s)]
*  means something. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3849.04s)]
*  And by the way, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3851.04s)]
*  it brings it to the point of the First Amendment. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3853.04s)]
*  How important is that? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3855.04s)]
*  You know what it is? You can't protect [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3857.04s)]
*  the First Amendment without the Second. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3859.04s)]
*  So you don't think barging in your [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3863.04s)]
*  house and confiscating your weapons is [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3865.04s)]
*  something that we can do? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3867.04s)]
*  Is there a harm in this, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3869.04s)]
*  because it's not the first amendment [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3871.04s)]
*  that's been made ever since. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3873.04s)]
*  But I think it's important. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3875.04s)]
*  What is common sense? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3879.04s)]
*  Gun reform? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3881.04s)]
*  Yeah, probably not. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3883.04s)]
*  The problem with the common sense laws [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3887.04s)]
*  is I can talk to some of my [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3889.04s)]
*  left-wing friends and they suggest these things. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3891.04s)]
*  And the other, okay, that makes sense. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3893.04s)]
*  I see it, these dumb shit attorneys that drop all these [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3895.04s)]
*  bills, they'll flip this wording so freaking bad around [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3900.22s)]
*  that they'll take advantage of these laws and it will keep [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3904.2799999999997s)]
*  going like this and take and take and take. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3906.7799999999997s)]
*  If we had sensible people, everything would be fine. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3909.92s)]
*  But you've got people that scam on everything. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3914.48s)]
*  They scam on their insurance. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3916.6s)]
*  They scam on this. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3918.24s)]
*  It's the guy that when you're in line to get off and he comes [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3919.08s)]
*  around and cuts right in. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3922.6s)]
*  It's these people. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3923.84s)]
*  You know, there's tons of them everywhere and they screw [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3924.76s)]
*  everything up for everybody. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3926.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3928.76s)]
*  So you just can't have so many just decent common things, you [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3929.1600000000003s)]
*  know, in line. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=3932.8s)]

*  like Thursday to Sunday morning. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4111.92s)]
*  Rest I had to, you know, parent-teacher conferences, had [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4116.160000000001s)]

*  and the other and everything else. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4121.96s)]
*  And then finally, you know, years back, I just figured it [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4123.96s)]
*  out that let's replace those bad habits with good habits. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4126.76s)]
*  It's Friday night. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4129.56s)]
*  I've worked my ass off all week, just came from aerosols. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4131.080000000001s)]
*  I'm going to have a beer. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4133.360000000001s)]
*  It's just, I'm not the weird one. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4134.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4136.360000000001s)]
*  I don't do this every night anymore. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4137.8s)]
*  Five days a week, I'm on a strict health regiment, this, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4139.400000000001s)]
*  that and the other. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4142.080000000001s)]
*  I took my bad habits and I replaced those with good [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4142.56s)]
*  habits, and that's really what I did. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4145.400000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4148.400000000001s)]
*  Do you know other people in your business who've done that [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4151.88s)]
*  or were still around, like guys you started with? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4153.68s)]
*  A few of them, yeah. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4156.52s)]
*  A lot of them was, well, I think Scott Stapp changed his life [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4159.2s)]
*  around. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4162.92s)]
*  He was pretty messed up for a while, trust me. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4163.84s)]
*  And I hear, you know, Creed's back doing great stuff. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4167.24s)]
*  I know, so, you know, it is possible. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4170.24s)]
*  It's not a story you hear very often. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4174.24s)]
*  A lot of time it's like, you know, you know, the band breaks [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4176.24s)]
*  up, you know, like screw you, screw you, we all hate each [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4179.24s)]
*  other and blah, blah, blah. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4182.24s)]
*  And then 10 years later, you know, you're like, I'm going to [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4184.24s)]
*  be like, 10 years later, they're like, you got any money? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4187.24s)]
*  They're like, no, do you? [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4191.24s)]
*  They're like, I don't either. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4194.24s)]
*  They're like, we're getting the band back together. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4195.24s)]
*  Reunion tour. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4198.24s)]
*  We were driving from Detroit to Ennekema, Michigan last summer [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4202.24s)]
*  and Ennekema, Portage Lake. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4206.24s)]
*  And it's like what, three or four hour drive and we had, we [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4210.24s)]
*  had played this game in the car. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4213.24s)]
*  We can only listen to music from Michigan. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4214.24s)]
*  You were on there. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4217.24s)]
*  Must have been an awesome ride. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4218.24s)]
*  It was, but that's my question. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4220.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4222.24s)]
*  And not even mentioning Motown. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4223.24s)]
*  Like you can just go, I mean, you could drive from here to [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4225.24s)]
*  Fairbanks and just listen to Michigan music. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4227.24s)]
*  Drive from here to China. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4229.24s)]
*  Put your car in a boat. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4231.24s)]
*  So why, why has this state produced so much good music? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4232.24s)]
*  Well, I think it was, you know, the migration from the South, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4235.24s)]
*  you know, and, and all the, everyone came to work and they [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4239.24s)]
*  industrial revolution in the auto industry. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4243.24s)]
*  Some people stopped in Chicago. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4246.24s)]
*  That's where you got like the blues scene that formed. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4248.24s)]
*  And then other people kept going because you could get this wage [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4250.24s)]
*  and you could work and get off at three o'clock and you could [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4253.24s)]
*  play at the bars. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4255.24s)]
*  And that is where you got the sadder people stopped in [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4256.24s)]
*  Chicago. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4258.24s)]
*  Whatever it was back then, you know, people, man, we can go [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4261.24s)]
*  work up there and make money and be, you know, be treated pretty [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4264.24s)]
*  decently, you know, even though it was pretty horrible in those [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4267.24s)]
*  factories back then to a lot of these people coming from the [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4269.24s)]
*  South after this time, you know, dark period in our history. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4272.24s)]
*  And they came up here and, you know, you get off the planet [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4276.24s)]
*  three o'clock or whatever, you go play the bars, you know, or [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4278.24s)]
*  vice versa. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4281.24s)]
*  You get off at a certain time and that, and you had all this [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4282.24s)]
*  melting pot of people come from everywhere to come for this [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4285.24s)]
*  industrial revolution. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4288.24s)]
*  I think the combination of that, you know, from, and having, you [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4289.24s)]
*  know, jazz and blues here, everything, you know, the oldest [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4293.24s)]
*  jazz club is in Detroit. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4296.24s)]
*  Baker's keyboard lounge. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4298.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4299.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4300.24s)]
*  Baker's keyboard lounge. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4301.24s)]
*  And, you know, John, John Lee Hooker writing those songs down [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4302.24s)]
*  in Haston street. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4305.24s)]
*  Oh, mama had a dream last night. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4306.24s)]
*  And then it just goes on and on from there. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4310.24s)]
*  It's a prison of soul music and Motown and, you know, rock and [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4312.24s)]
*  roll and house music and, you know, hip hop. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4315.24s)]
*  And it just, you know, it hasn't stopped. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4317.24s)]
*  You think, you think the leadership of Michigan will get [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4320.24s)]
*  better? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4322.24s)]
*  I fucking hope so. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4323.24s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4325.24s)]
*  Gretchen Schitmer. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4327.24s)]
*  So that's not an endorsement. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4329.24s)]
*  Do you know anyone who voted for her? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4331.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4334.24s)]
*  That was an extended family member. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4336.24s)]
*  What did, did the extended family member explain why? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4338.24s)]
*  I don't know, but, ah, man, this is a tough one to be talking [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4343.24s)]
*  about family, but that's like most of these people are like [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4349.24s)]
*  divorced, overweight. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4354.24s)]
*  Pissed off at the world. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4357.24s)]
*  You know, angry at every man alive. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4360.24s)]
*  And I've, my gut tells me those are the women that voted for [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4363.24s)]
*  her. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4367.24s)]
*  I think that's probably the deepest thing ever uttered on [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4369.24s)]
*  this stage and the truest. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4372.24s)]
*  My personal research on the question confirms what you just [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4374.24s)]
*  said. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4378.24s)]
*  So it would be good to have a happy governor with happy [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4379.24s)]
*  voters and a happy state. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4382.24s)]
*  Someone shouting Kid Rock for governor. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4384.24s)]
*  Would you run for governor of Michigan? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4386.24s)]
*  What's that? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4388.24s)]
*  That's actually why I came tonight was to announce my [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4390.24s)]
*  candidacy. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4393.24s)]
*  You know, you, the funny thing is you'd probably win and you'd [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4395.24s)]
*  probably be great. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4401.24s)]
*  Yeah, that was messed up when I was doing that little Senate [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4403.24s)]
*  bit. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4407.24s)]
*  By the way, Trump asked me about that for a couple of years. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4408.24s)]
*  I was like, hey man, I was just screwing around. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4411.24s)]
*  And I was winning. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4414.24s)]
*  Like actually my brother saw Debbie stabbing out like [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4416.24s)]
*  backstage at one of my shows. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4420.24s)]
*  I know, boo. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4422.24s)]
*  And she's like, my brother's like, what are you doing here? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4424.24s)]
*  She's like, I just wanted to thank your brother. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4428.24s)]
*  He raised me so much money with that little Senate stunt. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4431.24s)]
*  And I'm like, oh shit. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4434.24s)]
*  I wouldn't plan it on that. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4436.24s)]
*  I backfired a lot. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4438.24s)]
*  I backfired a little bit. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4440.24s)]
*  Do you think you'd have fun doing it though? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4442.24s)]
*  No, I don't think anybody should have fun doing it. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4445.24s)]
*  I'm sick of every politician on every side thinking they're a [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4449.24s)]
*  fucking celebrity. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4453.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4455.24s)]
*  When the celebrities should really be the people who fight [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4457.24s)]
*  and die for this country, who keep their mouth shut and do [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4462.24s)]
*  their job, go to work every day. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4466.24s)]
*  And then you've got these politicians who are like, well, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4468.24s)]
*  I just got off this and I wrote a book. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4471.24s)]
*  And I've got a job at Fox News now. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4473.24s)]
*  And I'm on CNN. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4475.24s)]
*  And I'm over here. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4477.24s)]
*  And I think I'm a big deal. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4479.24s)]
*  Want a selfie with me? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4481.24s)]
*  You're supposed to be doing a service to your country. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4483.24s)]
*  And the reason we can't get any good people is because it's like [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4485.24s)]
*  when people say about Trump, well, he said grab them by the [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4488.24s)]
*  pussy. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4491.24s)]
*  And this Senate is like, whatever. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4493.24s)]
*  We're not electing the deacon of the church. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4495.24s)]
*  This is going to protect you and your family. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4497.24s)]
*  We're not electing the deacon of the church. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4499.24s)]
*  This is going to protect you and your taxes. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4501.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4503.24s)]
*  It's going to protect you and your family values. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4505.24s)]
*  And there's nobody in here. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4507.24s)]
*  Cast the first stone. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4509.24s)]
*  He has no sin. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4511.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4513.24s)]
*  We all got some dirt somewhere. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4515.24s)]
*  You know, you run for office and they're going to dig it up and [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4517.24s)]
*  they're going to drag you through the mud and punish your [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4519.24s)]
*  family and friends. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4523.24s)]
*  And I think it's an opportunity for people to make this a better [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4525.24s)]
*  place. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4527.24s)]
*  I'm going to call on the people who have been there for eight [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4529.24s)]
*  years, eight years of their life, to make this a better place. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4532.24s)]
*  To say, like, I've been very successful if I can sacrifice, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4534.24s)]
*  which I think Trump has done. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4537.24s)]
*  Didn't take a paycheck when he's in office. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4539.24s)]
*  He's a freaking billionaire. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4541.24s)]
*  He's got a hot wife. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4543.24s)]
*  He's got real estate all over the world. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4545.24s)]
*  And he's like, no, let me run for president. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4547.24s)]
*  Somebody take a shot at me. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4549.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4551.24s)]
*  You know, that was pretty close, I would say. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4553.24s)]
*  Just drinking beer on a Friday night with Tucker and some friends. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4565.24s)]
*  I know you've talked to him in the last month. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4573.24s)]
*  If someone shot me in the face, it would give me pause, I must say. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4579.24s)]
*  He didn't even seem to slow down. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4583.24s)]
*  I think he said that the other night on Gutfeld, which I thought [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4587.24s)]
*  was great. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4589.24s)]
*  I actually told him, I said, sir, I go in that setting with several [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4591.24s)]
*  people that are smart, funny, I go, you shine like a diamond. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4597.24s)]
*  It's just not talking policy over and over again. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4601.24s)]
*  You were funny, engaging, you still had your points. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4603.24s)]
*  If you don't know what Trump's policies are right now, you must [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4607.24s)]
*  live in a freaking cave. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4609.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4611.24s)]
*  We understand what he wants to do. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4613.24s)]
*  This is the first time, I know I'm getting off track, but I tell [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4615.24s)]
*  people, I was talking to some people in my band today at rehearsal, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4617.24s)]
*  some of them are Democrats, some of them are gay. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4619.24s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4621.24s)]
*  But it's fun to have discussions. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4623.24s)]
*  And the way I broke it down to one of my band members was, just think [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4625.24s)]
*  of it like this. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4627.24s)]
*  This is one of the only times in our lifetime, certainly, and I [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4629.24s)]
*  think it's a great thing. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4631.24s)]
*  I think it's only happened twice before. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4633.24s)]
*  You don't even need these people, Kamala Harris or Trump, to say [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4635.24s)]
*  anything. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4637.24s)]
*  They both have four years of a track record. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4639.24s)]
*  Period. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4641.24s)]
*  You don't need to look any farther. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4643.24s)]
*  Just check their homework. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4645.24s)]
*  Okay, Kamala Harris, D-minus. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4647.24s)]
*  Donald Trump, A-plus. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4649.24s)]
*  And I think it's a great thing. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4651.24s)]
*  I think it's a great thing. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4653.24s)]
*  I think it's a great thing. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4655.24s)]
*  I think it's a great thing. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4657.24s)]
*  I think it's a great thing. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4659.24s)]
*  Donald Trump, A-plus. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4661.24s)]
*  Boom. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4663.24s)]
*  I'm going to vote for the guy that got the A-plus. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4665.24s)]
*  You said that you watch all kinds of media. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4671.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4673.24s)]
*  Who drives you craziest? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4675.24s)]
*  Who drives me craziest? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4677.24s)]
*  Man. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4681.24s)]
*  There are lots to choose from, obviously. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4683.24s)]
*  Yeah, not really media, but [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4687.24s)]
*  I mean, none of them drive me crazy. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4689.24s)]
*  I just laugh it off. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4691.24s)]
*  I don't let people get in my skin like that. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4693.24s)]
*  In case you haven't noticed, I could give a frog's fat ass. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4695.24s)]
*  Nobody's getting under my skin like that. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4701.24s)]
*  How much time do you spend watching The View? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4703.24s)]
*  You know, sometimes I'll watch the morning programs [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4707.24s)]
*  and then I get done with my workouts coming here [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4709.24s)]
*  and when I come back down, it'll be on. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4711.24s)]
*  Because I didn't change it. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4713.24s)]
*  I like to watch Varney. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4715.24s)]
*  Fox Business. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4717.24s)]
*  I love Varney. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4719.24s)]
*  I do too. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4721.24s)]
*  But if I didn't flip it before I went up to the house [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4723.24s)]
*  and do my other workout, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4725.24s)]
*  it'll be on and I'll be like [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4727.24s)]
*  pop a bag of popcorn [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4729.24s)]
*  and be like, I see what these bitches got to say today. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4731.24s)]
*  Yeah, they annoy me. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4737.24s)]
*  But at the same time, I'm just laughing at them. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4741.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4743.24s)]
*  I'm not like, oh my gosh, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4745.24s)]
*  they ruined my day. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4747.24s)]
*  I'm like, look at these hoes. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4749.24s)]
*  CNN doesn't make you mad? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4753.24s)]
*  I mean, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4757.24s)]
*  it's more fodder than mad. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4759.24s)]
*  You know what makes me mad? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4763.24s)]
*  Every time I go to the fridge [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4765.24s)]
*  and open something up [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4767.24s)]
*  and it's got a little plastic label, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4769.24s)]
*  get that thing off. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4771.24s)]
*  And I'm like, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4773.24s)]
*  get this thing off it. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4775.24s)]
*  And I'm like, God, son of a bitch. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4777.24s)]
*  That pisses me off. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4779.24s)]
*  Why? Because there's some fruitcakes [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4781.24s)]
*  running around that want to put weird stuff in your food. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4783.24s)]
*  I'm like, we should just execute these people. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4785.24s)]
*  Get them out of the gene pool. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4787.24s)]
*  That's what pisses me off. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4791.24s)]
*  So food packaging is your top issue, would you say? [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4795.24s)]
*  Yep. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4799.24s)]
*  I'm in my 50s too, man. I feel you. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4801.24s)]
*  Why does every apple have to come [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4803.24s)]
*  with a little plastic sticker on it? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4805.24s)]
*  You get a piece of fruit, you wash it [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4807.24s)]
*  and you're like, oh fuck, somebody put a sticker on this thing. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4809.24s)]
*  But that's never [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4813.24s)]
*  brought up in a single presidential debate [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4815.24s)]
*  and I'm wondering why. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4817.24s)]
*  Well, if you'd like to see [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4819.24s)]
*  how it really goes, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z0TsN5Jrlg&t=4821.24s)]
