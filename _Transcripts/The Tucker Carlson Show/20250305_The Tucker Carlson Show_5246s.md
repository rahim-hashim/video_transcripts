# The Chosen’s Jonathan Roumie: Answering God’s Call & Christian Resilience in the Face of Persecution
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI)
*  You're an actor, you're looking for work, you're an agent, or somebody calls you and says, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=0.0s)]
*  we'd like you to play Jesus. What's that like? It was an answered prayer. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5.28s)]
*  The person who made that call was a friend and a colleague by that point, a guy by the name of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=30.0s)]
*  Dallas Jenkins who created The Chosen. And I had played Jesus for him for his church's Good Friday [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=38.4s)]
*  service in these little vignettes three times over the course of four years between 2014 and 2017. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=48.16s)]
*  Just literally in a church. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=59.68s)]
*  In a church. So we'd go and shoot out on a farm, these vignettes, whatever built sets into this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=61.04s)]
*  His church has like a little studio, but mostly on location, we would film these little films [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=67.36s)]
*  that would be in the spirit of Good Friday or illustrate a particular gospel passage or [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=74.0s)]
*  scripture scene that was in line with the theme of the service for that year. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=80.8s)]
*  And yeah, so the first time I played Jesus in one of those short films was the crucifixion. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=89.92s)]
*  I was in it for five minutes. The film itself is called The Two Thieves. You can actually find it, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=97.68s)]
*  I think, on Amazon still. And it was about, it was a what if story about the two thieves [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  crucified on either side of Christ. Like, who were they? How did they get there? How do you go [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  in like one of the gospels in one paragraph from, you know, he was being mocked and reviled even by [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=118.08s)]
*  the thieves next to him to all of a sudden the penitent thief, as he's referred to, gives his [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=124.64s)]
*  life basically to Jesus in that moment and says, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=131.04s)]
*  And Jesus says, truly today you will be with me in paradise. And he basically, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=135.92s)]
*  it's like the first confession on the cross. And he grants him access to the kingdom. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=140.4s)]
*  And so how does that, how do you go from being one of the mockers, revilers to this sudden [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=147.44s)]
*  conversion on the cross? And so he tries to, Dallas tries to answer that question in the course of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=155.44s)]
*  this 25 minute film. I actually read for The Penitent Thief because he's got this, this fantastic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=162.16s)]
*  narrative arc. And then, and I thought I'd had a great audition. It was in LA at the time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=170.4s)]
*  And I knew it was an opportunity to like, you know, get paid a nominal stipend for some work [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=178.4s)]
*  in another city, in this case, suburban Chicago. And I thought, man, I would audition for the short [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=184.24s)]
*  film. I don't care if it's for a church. It's great story. The script is great. So I go and I [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=191.28s)]
*  audition. I had a great audition. I'm like, I think I nailed it. A couple of days later, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=197.36s)]
*  I get a call back to come back in, but this time to read for Jesus. And I thought to myself, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=202.64s)]
*  ah, man, I didn't get the first role. And then I looked again at the script and like, Jesus got [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=210.55999999999997s)]
*  like five lines in the whole thing. But I had happened to have played Jesus six months prior [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=215.76s)]
*  for another completely independent project up in Washington state at a studio for this Catholic [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  company called St. Luke Productions about this saint in the early 20th century named St. Faustina, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=227.84s)]
*  who was considered a mystic. She had these visions. She wrote an entire diary that was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  sort of dictated to her by Christ himself in these visions. And so I played Jesus in the vision [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=239.36s)]
*  aspect of that story for this traveling one woman show where it was an actress playing the saint, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=247.52s)]
*  a screen behind her, a couple of rudimentary set pieces, and then all of the other characters [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=254.96s)]
*  in the show, in the play, including these visions of Jesus was projected on the screen that she would [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=261.36s)]
*  choreographically time out her scenes with for 90 minutes. So fast forward six months later, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=267.04s)]
*  I get to audition for the two thieves. I didn't get the penitent thief. I go and I audition for [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=275.12s)]
*  Jesus because I'm like, you know what, I enjoyed playing Jesus six months ago. Like this would be [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=281.2s)]
*  cool if I got, if I got anything, it'd be cool because I wasn't working steadily consistently. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=286.24s)]
*  And the way Dallas tells the story about 10 seconds into the audition, he's like, that's Jesus. That's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=292.88s)]
*  my Jesus for this show. And so we did that film and it was screened. He brought me back to, to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=298.0s)]
*  view it like a month later at the Good Friday service with his church, about seven services. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=304.8s)]
*  It was like 15,000 people saw this thing in a matter of a day and a half. And it was remarkably [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=311.2s)]
*  well-received. It was so beautiful. And it was, it was the essentially the foundational bones of the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=318.56s)]
*  concept of the chosen, which is this, this sort of Ignatian spirituality, this Ignatian insight [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=326.32s)]
*  into the gospels, which is basically you put yourself in the gospel, you ask in the gospels, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=334.56s)]
*  you ask yourself a series of questions and that's how you meditate on the gospels through this form [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=340.24s)]
*  of spirituality. And so this, this process of filmmaking was kind of like a living example of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=345.04s)]
*  that on, on celluloid or digital celluloid. And so we did it again, the following year for a different [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=351.36s)]
*  kind of scene. And then we skipped a year and then 2017, the spring of 2017, I did one more film [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=359.76s)]
*  with him for his church. And then it was in probably the summer of 2018 where he called me [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=366.16s)]
*  and said, Hey, want to put the sales back on? I think we're going to do this four episodes of a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=373.2s)]
*  crowdfunded TV show, probably not going to go anywhere, but it'd be some consistent work. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=380.08s)]
*  And I jumped at the chance. I thought, okay, I had now played Jesus for him a few times. I was [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  getting really comfortable with the role. I was also pulled in during that time between like 2016 [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=392.88s)]
*  and 2019. I started doing these passion plays, being involved in these passion plays that a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=397.76s)]
*  friend of mine was directing. And then I helped co-direct and then I co-wrote a version of the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=405.44s)]
*  passion that we would put on for our church. And so for whatever reason, like God was putting me [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=411.76s)]
*  in these situations and these, in these stories about Jesus so often in such a short, I mean, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=420.88s)]
*  a relatively short period of time, in a few years, I'd played Jesus like five, six, seven times. And [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=429.68s)]
*  I started to think like, well, there must be something to this. Like, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=436.0s)]
*  I don't know what it is yet. And then when I got the call for the chosen, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=440.64s)]
*  the penny dropped. It was like, Oh, all of that was preparation for this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  And it became much more than anyone thought it would be. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=457.2s)]
*  I would say so. Yes. The four episodes that probably wouldn't go anywhere became eight [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=462.23999999999995s)]
*  episodes of a first season of the show that was crowdfunded by selling shares to fund the show. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  And then released in the fall of 2019, re-released for free because we were charging, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=476.96s)]
*  I think, 15 bucks for the season, the entire eight episodes on DVD and streaming. And then [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=486.8s)]
*  when the pandemic hit, the chosen, the folks at the chosen said, we want to do something to kind [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=494.0s)]
*  of ease people's burdens and give the show away for free. And it exploded after that, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  like beyond anyone's imagination. And since then, it's always been free on the app, the chosen app. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  So, and then now we just did a deal with Amazon. Amazon is going to be our exclusive window [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=517.0400000000001s)]
*  for the streaming of the show after its initial theatrical run, which for season five will be [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=523.6s)]
*  March 28th. It'll be in theaters for about a month. Then it'll go to Amazon for 90 days [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=529.84s)]
*  exclusively. And then it'll go to the app where it will remain free. I mean, it's turned into the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=535.2s)]
*  biggest thing in that genre maybe ever. Yeah. Yeah. They don't often, nobody really releases [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=542.0s)]
*  figures in streaming for viewership and any of that kind of data, but we do because we're like, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=550.0s)]
*  we don't care. We want to tell people. Like it's been estimated right now that about [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=556.32s)]
*  280 million people have seen the show globally. 340 million in the United States total. So that's [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=562.08s)]
*  pretty deep penetration as we say on TV. I would say so. That's amazing. So the reason I asked the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=572.08s)]
*  question and you didn't flinch was that I think some people would feel like that's a pretty heavy [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=577.52s)]
*  role in Jesus basis of the world's largest religion. God himself, according to Christians. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=582.4s)]
*  Did you ever feel that on you? Like that's a lot. In the first season I did, there was this moment, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=589.68s)]
*  especially Jeff kind of talked about at times where, and it's still, I think it's still sort of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=597.92s)]
*  affects me. I actually like telling the story because it's a reminder for me to remember [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=606.8s)]
*  what it's all about and who I'm serving as I endeavored to portray this role. And so we were [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=614.64s)]
*  about midway through the first season and the time came for me as Jesus to start preaching, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=621.68s)]
*  full on sermons. And we started filming and then as I was going through these words, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=631.5999999999999s)]
*  I kind of felt I was outside of myself, listening to myself preach to a crowd outside the doors of, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=641.28s)]
*  in our story, Zebedee James and John's father's house. And there was a crowd of people that was [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=648.64s)]
*  growing, crowd of onlookers, our wonderful background actors that participate in the show [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=656.08s)]
*  and many of whom have participated for years. This crowd starts growing outside the house as [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=662.56s)]
*  Jesus begins preaching and the scene's not specifically about Jesus, it's about other [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=670.88s)]
*  stuff that's happening in the background that becomes the foreground of the story. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=674.88s)]
*  And in the background, Jesus is preaching, but I still have to preach. I still have to say [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=679.36s)]
*  these lines from scripture convincingly and try to mesmerize and galvanize the people that are [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=683.76s)]
*  listening to me and get their attention. And they seemed really attentive, so much so that it made me [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=689.12s)]
*  really self-aware. And I thought, what am I saying? What are these words? Like, these are [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=696.4s)]
*  holy, holy words set by the holiest being that ever walked the face of the earth. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=704.08s)]
*  I shouldn't be doing this. This feels wrong. And so I would have those feelings and then, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=709.84s)]
*  you know, we would stop and then move on to the next setup and put the camera in a different place. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  And then as it went on, I just had to stop the production for a moment to talk to the director, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=720.0s)]
*  to Dallas Jenkins. And I said, can we just, can we hold it? Can we just slow down a second? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=727.28s)]
*  And he said, what's going on? And so I took him aside. I said, listen, man, I'm having a hard [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=732.4s)]
*  time right now. Like I was starting to feel panicked and overwhelmed. Almost like they [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=739.04s)]
*  be, I've only had one panic attack in my life. And it started to feel like it was creeping into [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  that. And I didn't know what, why, or how, well, I kind of knew, I thought I knew why and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  what was going on. But I just said, can we slow it down? And he said, what's going on? And I said, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=756.64s)]
*  I'm saying these words and it's, and hearing them, hearing myself say them, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=763.04s)]
*  I don't feel worthy to be saying them. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=768.8s)]
*  This is why I tell this story, because [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=777.12s)]
*  it drives home the point [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  of the gift that I've been given in playing this role. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=785.28s)]
*  And he puts his hand on my shoulder and he says, brother, none of us are truly worthy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=787.68s)]
*  But here we are. I mean, it's you and me. Here we are. We're doing this so that the world [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=794.2399999999999s)]
*  may know his story. Those who haven't heard his story may know the impact that he's had on the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=801.5999999999999s)]
*  world and on our lives personally. And I'm slightly paraphrasing because it's been many [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  years since we shot that, but that was the essence. And it settled my spirit. And I thought, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=815.0400000000001s)]
*  you know, he's right. He's right. For whatever reason, God saw fit to put, for whatever reason, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=824.5600000000001s)]
*  God saw fit to put me in that role and not somebody else. Nobody else auditioned. There [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  wasn't, there weren't auditions for the role. He had just called me up and said, do you want [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=839.36s)]
*  to do this again? And I said, yes, of course. I didn't hesitate. And, but then when we got to [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=843.84s)]
*  that moment, it started to dawn on me the weight of the burden that I was carrying. And I thought, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=851.0400000000001s)]
*  it started to dawn on me the weight of what it was that I was being given to do. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=860.24s)]
*  And would then inform the encounters and the experiences that I would have [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=867.04s)]
*  as the show progressed. And as we now arrive here at season five, the dawn of season five. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  When you started the series, did you believe, did you believe it? Did you believe in the gospel? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=881.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I was raised Christian. I was baptized Greek Orthodox. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=885.04s)]
*  We lived in New York City. And then when my family moved into the suburbs, there weren't really [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=894.88s)]
*  Greek Orthodox options. So my dad, having gone to Catholic school in Egypt, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=901.1999999999999s)]
*  and my mom being Catholic from Ireland and raised in the faith as well, were more than [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=909.6s)]
*  happy to just go down the street to the local Catholic church. It was familiar to my dad and [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=917.6s)]
*  part of my mom's upbringing. And for myself and my sisters, it just, it didn't feel different. It [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=924.16s)]
*  just felt right. And so I'm in my first communion and my confirmation as a Catholic. And [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=933.28s)]
*  probably when I got into my early twenties, I was revisiting the idea of my Orthodox roots as [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=940.8s)]
*  cousins and family members were getting married in the Orthodox church. And [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=948.16s)]
*  I so admired the beauty and the sanctity with which they approach the liturgy, which is quite [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=952.56s)]
*  different than Catholicism for the most part. I mean, there's Eastern Catholic rights, which [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=959.92s)]
*  are more similar to Greek Orthodox, but it was different. But it didn't draw me to go back [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=964.24s)]
*  completely. Because I think I just felt like, no, this feels like the truth as I understand it [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=974.0799999999999s)]
*  in God's eyes. This seems true. And it's the church that Christ himself ultimately started. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  And for the reasons God knows, and despite every effort to thwart it, especially the largest empire [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=994.4s)]
*  in the world at the time, despite the Roman Empire's attempts to stamp it out. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1008.0s)]
*  Through murder. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1012.56s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't happen. It's still going. And that means something to me. And so doing the show, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1014.64s)]
*  playing the character of Jesus, working with the Hallow App, doing all these prayer and meditation [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1025.2s)]
*  challenges with them, learning more about other stories of faith, other people of faith, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  through the challenges that we have coming up for Lent here. I've grown deeper in my faith. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  It's drawn me closer to the church to want to know more about the aspects of the church that [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1045.36s)]
*  I didn't necessarily grow up learning. I went to public school. So I had a Tuesday afternoon [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1051.9199999999998s)]
*  catechism or whatever the day was where you went to catechism. CCD after school. And I didn't learn [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1060.8s)]
*  any of the things that I've learned in the last several years because that's just not designed [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1068.8s)]
*  that way. And the church has such a rich history and tradition. It's so vast. It's such a storehouse. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1073.76s)]
*  There's so much to know and to learn. And through the experiences of playing Christ and getting to [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1082.48s)]
*  force myself to go into prayer and meditation prior to every season through these [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1093.52s)]
*  periodical prayer challenges. Like we just did one in Advent for Hallow and now we're doing the Pray [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1104.56s)]
*  40 which starts today, Ash Wednesday. It's forced me to just spend more time in the presence of God [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1110.64s)]
*  and wants me to get closer to him. What is Lent? Lent begins today. Begins today is 40 days of [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1121.0400000000002s)]
*  prayer, fasting and almsgiving leading up to Good Friday, the Friday before Easter, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1130.72s)]
*  the day Jesus Christ died on the cross and gave his life for humanity. Two days later, three days [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1138.32s)]
*  later we say if you include Friday, Easter Sunday, Jesus resurrects from the dead and original sin [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1144.0s)]
*  on the stain on mankind is lifted through our belief in Christ. And so Lent, for me, Lent is [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1153.9199999999998s)]
*  a time to, I think, simplify and it's a time to sacrifice and it's a time to draw myself closer [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1165.36s)]
*  through the way of the cross. Basically the theme of Hallow's Pray 40 challenge this year is called [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  the way and it's the way of surrender, the way of Christ basically. And everything that he did [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1184.0s)]
*  leading up to his passion, death and resurrection is something for us to meditate on in that 40 days. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1194.1599999999999s)]
*  Typically we try to make some sort of meaningful sacrifice. Some people say, oh, it's a time to [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1199.9199999999998s)]
*  give up chocolate. Well, if chocolate is something that gives you joy and happiness, then yeah, that [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1210.0s)]
*  might be a good thing for you to give up for 40 days and it can be really hard for some people [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1218.16s)]
*  like me, be coffee. For some people it's alcohol. For some people it's cigars or cigarettes or [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1224.64s)]
*  something. Do you do asparagus every year? It's not the toughest Lent program. Does asparagus give you [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1231.1200000000001s)]
*  joy? Because if it doesn't, just kidding, Tucker, I would think you may want to revisit. Lent is here, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1237.1200000000001s)]
*  the period before Easter, the 40 days and it's a unique chance to get closer to God. That's the [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1245.12s)]
*  point of it. Hallow, the world's number one prayer app can help you do that. Joining their prayer 40 [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1249.76s)]
*  challenge. It's a great way to connect with Christians all over the world and unite in [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1255.52s)]
*  preparation for Easter, which is the payoff of this season. It's called the way. It helps participants [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1259.1999999999998s)]
*  focus on how Jesus is the way to heaven. If you join the challenge, you'll embark on a spiritual [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1264.32s)]
*  journey with some of America's most convicted Jesus followers. Powerful stories, prayer, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1269.52s)]
*  you grow in your ability to sacrifice. That's what Lent is, it's a sacrifice and taking thought [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1275.28s)]
*  provoking sermons and true stories of faith in action, which are amazing. This year is going to [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1279.6s)]
*  be the best Lent ever. Thousands of people praying together all over the world and you can be part of [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1285.12s)]
*  it through Hallow, which by the way is in use in my house and a nightly topic of conversation. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1289.68s)]
*  So you can sign up at hallow.com slash talker. When you join, check out thousands of guided [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1295.4399999999998s)]
*  prayers, meditations, music, and everything. There was a ton on how all designed to help you [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1300.0s)]
*  find peace and closeness to God. Download the Hallow app and jump onto the Lent Pray 40 challenge [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1305.9199999999998s)]
*  right now. So what, how do you observe it? Well, I start typically by going to mass, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1312.4799999999998s)]
*  getting ashes, which I have not yet done. And then fasting on, well, especially Ash Wednesday, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1320.16s)]
*  but typically, and it's not an obligation, but I like to fast on Wednesdays and Fridays. Sometimes [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1328.56s)]
*  it's nothing but maybe water. Sometimes it's just no meat. Fridays in Lent, especially no meat. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1338.24s)]
*  Fish, soups, broths are even okay. It's like fasting from the flesh. You're denying the flesh. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1346.8s)]
*  You're denying yourself. It's about denial, you know, and it recalls Christ's 40 days in the desert [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1355.36s)]
*  prior to the start of his ministry when he denied himself everything, food, water, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1364.08s)]
*  the temptations that he was faced with in the desert. He held steadfast and came out ready to [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1368.96s)]
*  basically start his ministry. And there's the practice of fasting is, spiritually speaking, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1381.04s)]
*  is super powerful. I mean, if there's obstacles or challenges that you're experiencing in your life [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1388.3999999999999s)]
*  that just don't seem to be resolved through traditional prayer. You know, Jesus himself [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1397.1200000000001s)]
*  was confronted by the disciples at one point. I think they were trying to cast out these demons [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1405.0400000000002s)]
*  of these in their community, and it wasn't working. And they had been given the power to do that. And [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1412.16s)]
*  he comes up on them and they basically said, well, we tried everything. We tried, you know, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1419.52s)]
*  cast them out in your name. It didn't work. Why didn't it work? And he said, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1425.68s)]
*  paraphrasing, some demons can only be cast out through prayer and fasting. And so that's that [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1430.96s)]
*  there's an extra, it's like an extra superpower level that you get given when you commit to denying [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1436.72s)]
*  yourself the things that the body needs with the intention that you are offering something out to [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1443.28s)]
*  God. Have you experienced that? Yeah. Yeah. I've, there have been decisions that in my life that [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1449.76s)]
*  I'd really been, or not even people, I'll go, I'll go even more personal. People that I prayed for [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1460.72s)]
*  that were, were sick, were in like a comatose state and through prayer and fasting, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1468.16s)]
*  remarkably on a particular day that I did this, came out of it. And then for like weeks, just [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1484.8000000000002s)]
*  unresponsive. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a game changer. Fasting. Yeah. In fact, in fact, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1493.2s)]
*  so to tie it to, to, to part of the reason why I'm here today, it's on Fridays in this prayer [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1501.04s)]
*  challenge on Hallow, Mark Wahlberg and Chris Pratt handle the fasting portion of the challenge. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1508.32s)]
*  So you, you go through this challenge seven days a week and on Fridays, which is the day we typically [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1516.64s)]
*  fast from meat, they get into the spirituality and the psychology of fasting, but the, the, the, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1522.64s)]
*  the potent spirituality of denial and what that means. And it's super powerful, man. It, it, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1528.3200000000002s)]
*  it affects change like few things do. Really? Yeah. Yeah. And, and that's like a true fast, not eat. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1537.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1547.3600000000001s)]
*  it's something that I would pray about. Like if, if for some people having just bread and water [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1553.76s)]
*  is extremely difficult or even just like a bowl of soup or water or like, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1562.0s)]
*  you know, there's the, the church, the Catholic church has a sort of a, as a suggested guides. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1570.0s)]
*  So it's essentially one meal and like partial meals, not, not a full second meal, I believe is [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1578.08s)]
*  one meal a day. But if that's, if that's too easy for you and you're like, well, that's not, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1585.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't feel like I'm sacrificing anything by just one meal. Like I want to go to no food at all. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1594.56s)]
*  And maybe just some water or a couple of pieces of bread, you know, bread and water. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1599.6s)]
*  Then that becomes your fasting. So I think it, it depends, but it's always something that [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1606.1599999999999s)]
*  I take to in prayer first, Lord, what do you, how do you want me to approach this fast? How can I [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1611.36s)]
*  deny myself? What, what do you need from me in this fast? And how can I serve you better through [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1618.24s)]
*  this fast? It's funny. Fasting is the one piece of religious observance that has pretty much disappeared [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1628.24s)]
*  in public conversations about religious observance. I mean, fasting sounds like a medieval practice. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1636.96s)]
*  Well, especially here in the West, you go to the Middle East. It's like, what are you talking about? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1643.84s)]
*  Of course I'm fasting. Where's the full month? Yeah. We're in it right now. Yeah. No food or water [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1649.04s)]
*  or tobacco or sex during the day period. Wow. No water. But there, you know, it's considered like [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1655.28s)]
*  a celebration as you know, but. Well, I also find like even the, the Middle Eastern Christians, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1663.1999999999998s)]
*  like the Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox, they, they're much more culturally rigorous when it comes to [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1671.6799999999998s)]
*  fasting, not just meat, but no dairy. And same thing with, with Muslims, no, no dairy, no, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1681.84s)]
*  I believe no, no meat, no dairy, no oils. I like there's a, there's a number of different levels, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1689.6s)]
*  but the same thing with, with the Christians and my family, like, wow, we don't, we don't do, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1696.4s)]
*  the Catholics don't do the no dairy thing, but yeah, you're right. I mean, here in the West, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1701.68s)]
*  it's. It does make you wonder if. You say you're fasting, people say why, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1708.48s)]
*  then you got to explain, you know, it's foreign. I mean, it's all, it's all over the New Testament [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1713.6000000000001s)]
*  references to fasting. Yeah. And, and as you just said, it's, it's not simply Christianity. It's [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1719.68s)]
*  like, it was just a feature of religious observance, like from the beginning of time. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1724.96s)]
*  Yeah. And it's gone and you in the mainstream, it's gone. So you wonder, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1728.64s)]
*  is there a connection between like eating and spiritual awareness? Clearly there is. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1733.68s)]
*  Is there a connection between overeating and spiritual dullness? Maybe there is. And if you [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1739.04s)]
*  wake up and everyone's fat, which is true, including me from time to time, so I'm not judging. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1744.32s)]
*  Um, there's just, there's like a spiritual component there now. Or am I? Well, I mean, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1750.0s)]
*  it's a crazy suggestion. One of the seven deadly sins is gluttony. Yeah. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1757.3600000000001s)]
*  Doesn't have to be food, but it can be like, how are you being gluttonous in your life? Is it, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1762.88s)]
*  or are you hoarding things? You keep, if it's food, like, is it just not putting any kind of [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1769.1200000000001s)]
*  boundaries on your satiety? Like, it's like, you know what? And, and, and I think it's, it's something [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1775.12s)]
*  that can, can fuel other sort of leeches into breaking that spiritual connection to the divine. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1783.52s)]
*  I mean, there's no doubt. One of the most striking things about having grown up and living in the [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1796.56s)]
*  modern West is realizing things later in life that are like glaringly obvious. And you think [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1801.84s)]
*  to yourself like, how did I not notice that? Of course, gluttony is bad. Greed is bad. Worshipping [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1806.6399999999999s)]
*  money is bad. These are all violence is bad. These are all the things that I've realized in the last [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1812.32s)]
*  couple of years had never occurred to me. Not one time. Well, then you see movies. I mean, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1816.3999999999999s)]
*  here's the power of entertainment. You see a movie like Wall Street. You got Michael Douglas, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1819.84s)]
*  who was a superstar at that time, the height of his career. Greed is good. I mean, isn't that [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1824.6399999999999s)]
*  the phrase from that movie? Yeah. But the funny thing is like, I'm old enough to remember when [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1828.64s)]
*  that came out, which I think was in the late eighties and it was used, it became political [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1831.68s)]
*  immediately. And it was like, this is what the Reagan era is like, and they're all greedy and [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1835.68s)]
*  whatever. And so of course, you know, I was not a liberal, so I was like, Oh, shut up. But I do [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1839.3600000000001s)]
*  think that was the, it's been almost 40 years. That was the last time I remember anybody in the [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1846.3200000000002s)]
*  United States saying greed was bad. That was the last time. Have you ever heard anybody say that? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1851.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe some like far out wacko protester or something, but no one you'd ever meet. I've [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1856.48s)]
*  really never heard anybody say greed is bad since then. Have you? No, no. It's, I mean, it's, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1862.56s)]
*  yeah. But it's everywhere too. It's everywhere. Which is maybe why you don't hear. And eating [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1869.92s)]
*  every day until you get fat. Also bad. Again, not judging. I've been greedy and I've been a [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1874.8s)]
*  gauntlet. And so like, I'm not, again, not judging, but it's bad. Like why not say, I don't know. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1879.44s)]
*  Yeah. Sorry. I'm just, I'm just coming to these very obvious conclusions. Well, I mean, I think [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1885.28s)]
*  luckily we have, I mean, that's what repentance is for, you know, in the Christian life. It's, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1890.0800000000002s)]
*  it's, you know, becoming aware of your faults and the way that you've hurt people or hurt yourself. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1896.16s)]
*  Yes. And if the body is truly a temple of the Lord, a reflection of the creation and of the creator [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1904.08s)]
*  God, and you're hurting yourself, then it's like, it's an affront to God, which is why things like [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1912.1599999999999s)]
*  gluttony are sinful because it's- But it also dulls you. It's like a bong head or, you know, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1918.72s)]
*  three beers or something. It keeps you from experiencing anything beyond yourself kind of. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1923.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You're now creating a wall around the ability to be, to be [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1929.6s)]
*  connected to from the divine. You know, it's like you're walling yourself off from God in a way. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1938.7199999999998s)]
*  It puts cheesecloth over your whole- That's right. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1945.6799999999998s)]
*  I love that you used food as a reference. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1949.76s)]
*  Something that kind of dulls the camera and makes the edges softer and you sort of don't fully [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1954.1599999999999s)]
*  perceive what's happening. I mean, you eat two Big Macs. You know, you're not as aware of anything. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1958.88s)]
*  Oh my gosh. It's like talk about comatose. It's a head injury, right? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1965.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. 100%. And so fasting is the opposite. You're hyper aware. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1970.48s)]
*  That's right. And your mind is just like, you sense everything. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1974.64s)]
*  Interesting. And the longer you do it, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1980.8000000000002s)]
*  it starts to, you know, I once I tried to, I know people who have done like [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1983.6000000000001s)]
*  40 day water fasts. I don't like with electrolytes and stuff. That's not, you know, whether it still [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1988.16s)]
*  sounds dangerous, but I don't know how I tried it for a week. One lent, I got through four days of it [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=1994.24s)]
*  and I'm like, this isn't going to work. Your body starts to do stuff that you have no control over. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2002.16s)]
*  You're like, can't imagine. And it's like, I think we're dying. So let's just get rid of everything. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2008.56s)]
*  I'm like, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm at work. I, this isn't, I'm on a, I'm on a set. This doesn't work. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2013.1200000000001s)]
*  I can't keep running to that. So I said, Lord, please forgive me. I can't continue this if I'm [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2019.6000000000001s)]
*  going to work for the rest of the week because I just, I, unless you make it stop, it's not stopping. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2026.64s)]
*  So I got a, I did my, but there's a truth last winter who was coming off a three week fast. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2031.52s)]
*  He's a very spiritual man. And I happened to be at his house when he broke his fast and he, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2037.84s)]
*  the first course was soup and he put, he hadn't had one thing in his mouth for three weeks other [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2043.04s)]
*  than water. That's it. Three weeks, three weeks, 21 days. And he puts the spoon in the soup and he [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2048.56s)]
*  holds it. He's talking and he holds it in front of his mouth. He's making a point and I'm watching [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2054.8s)]
*  this. Everyone's looking at it. And then he puts it down and then he does it again. And he's making [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2058.64s)]
*  this point and then he puts it down again. It's like, eat soup. That's self-control. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2064.0s)]
*  Yeah. So as you're- Well, at that point, I would think you almost don't want to break it. You're [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2070.32s)]
*  like, how long can I go? That's totally right. How far can I go with this? So funny though, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2073.92s)]
*  people go like, you know, climb, you know, pay to climb Everest or, you know what I mean? Or go, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2079.2s)]
*  you know, participate in some radical sport or, and they take these crazy risks and they push [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2086.4s)]
*  themselves to, you know, past obvious boundaries. And I'm not criticizing, I admire that. It's [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2091.84s)]
*  great. But no one ever thinks to just like not eat for a week and see what happens. That is a pretty [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2096.88s)]
*  bold thing to do. And maybe worth trying. I think everybody should try fasting. If they've never [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2103.36s)]
*  fasted, everybody should try fasting. I mean, you know, if you've got medical conditions, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2110.0s)]
*  I'm not a doctor, but I think discern and pray about it. And like it, I've only found it helpful. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2114.72s)]
*  And I think it just, even if it's just like for a day, like see what denial, denying yourself [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2123.2799999999997s)]
*  food, what does that do for your mind, for your spirit? You know, I mean, if, I don't know, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2131.12s)]
*  if you don't have a sense of spirituality, it might not mean anything. It might just be like [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2137.12s)]
*  a challenge. Like, I wonder if I can do it, you know? But I think the point is not to do it for [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2141.2s)]
*  the sake of doing it. I think to do it for the sake of, of depriving yourself and offering up [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2147.9199999999996s)]
*  the pain and the discomfort. And for some people, the suffering that that might cause, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2155.04s)]
*  taking that pain and suffering and discomfort through the fast and offering it towards an [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2162.64s)]
*  intention, a sick person, the decision to move to a new home, problems that a child is having in [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2168.56s)]
*  school, any kind of obstacles or challenges that seem insurmountable, fast, fast about it, pray and [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2178.64s)]
*  fast about it and see what the Lord can do with that and with your heart, because then it's [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2188.08s)]
*  what you're doing is you're opening up your heart. You know, it's not about, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2194.32s)]
*  well, if I do this exactly X, Y and Z, I mean, that Jesus's whole thing, issue with the Pharisees, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2197.84s)]
*  you know, you cleanse the outside of a cup, but then you, you, you, the stuff that's already inside [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2204.56s)]
*  you is just, is rotten. Your thoughts and your heart is rotten. So it doesn't matter that you [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2208.8s)]
*  wash your hands before you eat this and, and you eat that. Like he was calling out the Pharisees [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2214.32s)]
*  at one point for being so specific and attentive to the law. But meanwhile, he could see in their [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2219.84s)]
*  hearts that they just had malice and they had evil and they weren't doing the right thing for [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2227.76s)]
*  the priests of the time, what they should have been doing the same thing. It's like [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2233.44s)]
*  fasting for just, just to see if you can get through it. It doesn't really serve anyone other [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2238.96s)]
*  than your own ego. But offering up the pain that comes with the fasting, the denial that comes with [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2245.28s)]
*  fasting, the hunger pains that then gets applied in a spiritual way that that then assigns spiritual [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2252.5600000000004s)]
*  rewards to you by, by offering that for some of that's right. And it's by the way, just for [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2262.0s)]
*  in point of fact, I know, cause I've done a lot of fasting actually. And I love it. But it's not, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2268.4s)]
*  what's been the biggest thing that you've seen? It's not an effective weight loss approach. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2273.76s)]
*  In fact, I was talking to a friend of mine the other day who was Muslim. He said, I always get [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2279.44s)]
*  fat during Ramadan, you know, cause the second the sun goes down, you know, you're, you're pounding [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2283.44s)]
*  a dozen dates and going crazy with the hummus. Which is awesome. But I don't think I'm not, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2287.6800000000003s)]
*  don't ever go to me for medical advice, of course, but I, you know, I don't think going to fasting to [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2295.28s)]
*  lose weight is like effective at all. But I do think, I think this way it's like, if they're [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2300.24s)]
*  pushing on you, weed, Xanax and endless bread baskets, maybe there's an agenda, which is to [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2306.24s)]
*  make you duller and less aware of what's going on around you. And I think sicker and sick. And of [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2314.08s)]
*  course sicker. That's exactly right. But I, I, I must say I'd rather be dead than dull. You know [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2319.04s)]
*  what I mean? It's like sick is bad, but unaware is worse in my opinion. There are a lot of [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2324.24s)]
*  really enlightened sick people out there actually, you know, joyful sick people. Yeah. Oh yeah. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2330.16s)]
*  Of all the new year's resolutions you're likely to put off, the one you're most likely to put off [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2335.6s)]
*  and keep putting off is buying life insurance. And you should have life insurance. It's kind of crazy [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2340.56s)]
*  not to, because the future is unknown. You got to have life insurance, but you may not have life [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2345.04s)]
*  insurance because it's a huge hassle and it can be a huge ripoff, but there is an answer policy genius. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2350.64s)]

*  wind up looking back and wishing they'd had better life insurance or any life insurance. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2382.64s)]
*  It could have helped their families enormously. Policy genius can fix that for you. Peace of mind. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2387.6s)]

*  to Jesus's exchanges with the Pharisees. I'm reading Matthew right now. I'm really struck [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2411.12s)]
*  this time by the intensity of his rage at the Pharisees. He's pretty gentle with everybody else, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2418.4s)]
*  including the Roman officer, the occupying army pagan, worshiping the stars or whatever. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2426.88s)]
*  Jesus is really kind to him. Pharisees, I mean, it is just, and Matthew goes on for like five pages. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2434.0s)]
*  He's mad. What do you make of that? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2440.96s)]
*  Well, I think you have to ask yourself, well, why is he mad? Yeah. And what is he mad about? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2445.36s)]
*  And who are the Pharisees to him? And I think it's, it goes back to what I was [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2453.76s)]
*  referencing in that here you have [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2461.6s)]
*  who are people that are supposed to be models of God's law and rule and grace. The Pharisees, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2467.52s)]
*  like the priests, the people that the people look up to for spiritual advice and wisdom and guidance. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2480.7200000000003s)]
*  And because Jesus can read souls and read their know what's in their hearts, he sees their, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2488.64s)]
*  they're probably the worst of them. And he knows that they have ill will towards him and they have, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2495.12s)]
*  they don't have the interests of the people in their hearts because they're so enraptured by [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2505.52s)]
*  enraptured by the letters of the law. He said, you're so concerned about the letter of the law [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2514.48s)]
*  that you're not even considered about the heart of the law, which is, you know, God's mercy and [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2520.96s)]
*  justice. And how are these people, how are you treating these people? I mean, the fact that they [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2526.96s)]
*  would go every year on Passover, the poorest of the poor trying to bring their offerings and [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2533.84s)]
*  sacrifices that through extortion were getting charged 500%, may I, you know, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2540.72s)]
*  probably more than what they should have. I don't know the exact numbers, but like the point was [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2549.3599999999997s)]
*  that they were being extorted every step of the way by their own leaders, these Pharisees. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2554.64s)]
*  And that for him was the straw that broke the camel's back. And the next day he's [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2561.7599999999998s)]
*  like clearing the temple, you know, he's flipping the tables, flipping tables, whipping, you know, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2569.3599999999997s)]
*  using a whip to clear money changer stands and, and, and, you know, just outraged [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2576.0s)]
*  God's righteous anger. It's not the gentle Jesus at all. No, no, excuse me. No, it's not. It's, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2583.2799999999997s)]
*  um, it's, it's the fury of the Lord really come to visit them. It's not, you know, fire from heaven, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2591.44s)]
*  but it's fire on earth in this man's eyes. And, and also, you know, the precursor to what sets [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2600.64s)]
*  him up for the crucifixion. I mean, I think on some level he knows, number one, he has to, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2609.76s)]
*  he has to make an impression and he, and he is, um, vindicated through his actions [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2617.04s)]
*  because of who they are, who the Pharisees truly are deep down inside, but also that this will [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2624.64s)]
*  then continue the chain of events that have been set into motion that will put him on the cross [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2632.8s)]
*  so that he can redeem mankind. It seems like all of his anger is reserved for [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2638.56s)]
*  hypocrites. They get singled out repeatedly. Um, he seems to really hate that. Yeah. And [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2645.76s)]
*  the people in charge, the powerful, that's my read. I mean, I'm the opposite of the [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2653.04s)]
*  theology. I mean, I think, I think, you know, with power, you know, there's greed, there's [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2657.92s)]
*  hurting people at, at, you know, the ex at someone else's expense. Yes. Um, there's, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2667.12s)]
*  you know, taking advantage when you have the, all of these forces that try to, um, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2676.24s)]
*  I think take control over a society and the people, um, through, through power, through influence, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2682.56s)]
*  um, and there's nothing that those people can do. I mean, there's, it's, it's the definition of [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2692.4s)]
*  injustice. Yes. And God is about justice. Um, blessed are those who thirst for righteousness, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2699.52s)]
*  who thirst for justice, basically. Um, it's, it's, it was, it was the thing that one, it was one of [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2707.44s)]
*  the things that was most important to him and that people experience, you know, to have justice and [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2716.2400000000002s)]
*  feel human and be seen and be, and be not discounted because of their status, because of their, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2720.64s)]
*  you know, financial, um, you know, situation, because of who they were, who, what family they [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2725.8399999999997s)]
*  were born into or what, what, what, what, what cased for lack of a better term that they were [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2732.72s)]
*  born into, you know? Um, so I think it was, it was something that he, it was a last stand for him, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2738.08s)]
*  basically, in, in the, when he cleared the temple and it was all the preaching and, and, and the [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2746.48s)]
*  teaching didn't have enough of an effect on the Pharisees for them to change what they were doing. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2751.68s)]
*  So he, I think he had to, he had to show, don't tell, he had to show and not tell. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2759.68s)]
*  So when you're reading your scripts, when you're preparing, you're basically reading the gospel. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2766.48s)]
*  Yeah. Gospel plus, I'll say it's, you know, because as a TV show, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2773.52s)]
*  it's not always, you know, the scriptures as they are, don't always give us the full [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2781.6s)]
*  picture of a conversation. We definitely don't. Of a character, of a person. So we have to through, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2786.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, uh, biblical, uh, these, a group of biblical scholars that, and advisors that help us, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2793.2799999999997s)]
*  and give insight into the things that we're writing, we, we have to craft these plausible, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2802.1600000000003s)]
*  hopefully authentic backstories that create believable characters that could have existed [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2811.84s)]
*  in the first century that, um, augment the world that the gospels give us a glimpse into. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2818.8s)]
*  So a lot of it is scripture. Yes. But then there, there is some creative license taken [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2827.12s)]
*  just to be able to make a good TV show. Cause at the end of the day, this, this isn't, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2833.6s)]
*  this isn't the Bible. We're not saying this is the Bible. We're, we have a TV show first and [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2838.3199999999997s)]
*  foremost that is based on the gospels and hopefully is compelling enough for you to really, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2843.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, get hooked into it and binge it just like you would binge any other TV show. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2850.96s)]
*  And then start asking yourself, well, what, what did Jesus really say? Did he say these things? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2855.84s)]
*  Is this, is this character really like this? Like, let me, I want to explore. And then if you, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2862.48s)]
*  if you can get people to read the Bible and then want to have a relationship or even explore [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2868.08s)]
*  what it means to have faith, if you've never had faith, uh, or even be curious about Christ. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2875.12s)]
*  I mean, inevitably that is the relationship in a person's life that will change their life [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2881.52s)]
*  irrevocably. I mean, forever. So if we can create an entertaining story that is based on the truth [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2888.88s)]
*  of the gospels and who Jesus and the disciples were, maybe it'll introduce people to Christ [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2898.08s)]
*  and in a way that the audience has introduced him and maybe they'll want to follow him too. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2905.92s)]
*  How did it change your life? The gospel? I think the more I read the gospels, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2912.32s)]
*  the more I discover [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2921.52s)]
*  the Bible is, the Bible is alive. It's the living word, right? They say the Bible is alive. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2925.76s)]
*  And so at any given time, you can read a passage from scriptures, from the gospels, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2931.52s)]
*  even from the old Testament, the letters of Paul, the acts, um, that somehow will apply to your own [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2939.52s)]
*  life. Especially when you're struggling with something, you know, if I'm struggling with [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2949.2s)]
*  something, I just, I just can't figure it out. I just don't, I have no ideas about where to go to [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2956.3999999999996s)]
*  resolve it. Inevitably, there's the answers somewhere in the book and it's, it's a matter of [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2965.8399999999997s)]
*  sitting down with it and reading it. And I mean, it's remarkable the amount of times like [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2974.56s)]
*  I've had something in front of me that I just didn't know how to deal with it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2981.2s)]
*  And then I would flip to a random page and it's like, the answer is right there. It's right there. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2987.68s)]
*  So I stopped being surprised about it. I just like, of course that's, this is, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=2995.9199999999996s)]
*  yeah. And I take, I take notes. Sincere Christians never seem surprised by anything. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3003.3599999999997s)]
*  I've noticed that. It's amazing. It is amazing. And I've, I've, I've met those people where, um, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3008.64s)]
*  and we kind of talked a little bit about this at one point, where the craziest things are happening [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3018.16s)]
*  that they kind of already had an intuition was going to happen. Like, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3029.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't even know what's a good example. There've been so many times where it's like somebody [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3039.12s)]
*  wanted to, wanted to, to, uh, trying to get rid of their house or something like that, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3044.96s)]
*  trying to sell their house and, and, uh, like they, you know, they had like a certain amount of, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3050.72s)]
*  it's just an example. Like they had like a week to get out of their house for somebody to buy [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3057.3599999999997s)]
*  their house and, and, you know, somebody just comes knocking on the door and says, Hey, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3061.52s)]
*  you got a beautiful house. You, you're not selling this by chance. Are you? And you're like, well, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3066.64s)]
*  as a matter of fact, I am. And it just so happens that they're like, Lord, just let us find somebody [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3071.3599999999997s)]
*  that wants this house. Like we didn't even put it on the market yet, but, and then somebody knocks [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3076.48s)]
*  on their door like an hour later or, you know, like, I mean, crazy, crazy stories. And they're [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3081.04s)]
*  like, yeah, I just, God just did it. I'm like, how, what you, you don't seem phased. And yes. And [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3086.24s)]
*  that to me even it's just, I totally agree. Remarkable. And to flip it over, they, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3095.12s)]
*  they never seem shocked by how screwed up the world is. I'm shocked every single day. Like, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3100.96s)]
*  I can't believe they're committing abortion outside the DNC or I can't believe this, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3106.4s)]
*  that the other thing I'm always like, I can't believe the persecution of Christians. Why [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3109.6800000000003s)]
*  would you persecute Christians? Yeah. Like they've never mugged anybody. You know, like the nice, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3112.48s)]
*  even if you think their religion's silly, they're like the most peaceful people in the world. Their [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3116.1600000000003s)]
*  religion commands them to be. Why are we hating on them and, you know, banning their apps in [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3119.92s)]
*  Europe or whatever we're doing, putting them in jail for praying. But since you're Christians, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3125.36s)]
*  like, well, yeah. I mean, what did you think was going to happen? Do you know what I mean? Yeah. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3130.4s)]
*  Because he kind of, Jesus kind of set it up that way. Kind of did. He kind of told us 2000 years [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3134.88s)]
*  ago, you know, you'll be hated because of me, persecuted because of me. Like he, he, he lays [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3141.04s)]
*  it all out 2000 years ago, but just know it's okay. I overcame the world. It's, it's, you're good. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3148.88s)]
*  Just remember that you're good when things hit the fan. Just remember that. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3158.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I still find it infuriating. Sure. Sorry, I'm obviously not a good person. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3166.32s)]
*  No, it's a natural response. There's a lot of persecution of Christians and I'm really bothered [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3170.96s)]
*  by it. Your family, at least on one side is Arab Christian. Awful lot of Arab Christians get [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3178.24s)]
*  killed in a bunch of different countries all the time. And no one says a word about it. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3186.3199999999997s)]
*  No. Do you notice this? I do. Yeah, I do a lot. Christian persecution is something really close [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3191.2799999999997s)]
*  to my heart. In fact, I just executive produced an animated short film called The 21, which came out [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3196.72s)]
*  towards the end of February on the 10th anniversary of the martyrdom of the 21 martyrs in Libya. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3203.92s)]
*  And who were all, well, 20 of them were Coptic Christians from Egypt. One of them was non-Christian [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3213.52s)]
*  initially from Ghana. And they just rounded up all these guys. The ISIS came and rounded them up and [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3222.32s)]
*  tried to force them to deny their faith. They're just migrant workers. They went off to work for a [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3229.28s)]
*  few weeks to try to make some money and they got rounded up, just captured. And ISIS was like, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3236.6400000000003s)]
*  yeah, deny your faith and we'll let you go. Don't deny it, we'll kill you. They're like, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3245.84s)]
*  Oh, well, we're not going to do that. So, and they tortured them for months. And even the guy from Ghana, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3251.68s)]
*  ISIS said to him like, you can go, you're not, you're okay. You're not Christian. You're not [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3266.16s)]
*  one of these guys. And he's like, no, no, no, their God is my God. And so they say he converted [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3270.48s)]
*  and he died with them. And so six years ago, it's a producer friend of mine named Mark Rogers. He [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3278.7200000000003s)]
*  was in Egypt and he saw, he knew about the story and he saw the image of one of these martyrs who [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3286.4s)]
*  had like a lazy eye. And it reminded him of the image, which actually is on this little medallion [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3293.84s)]
*  of Christ, the Pantochrath or like, you know, basically it's that figure of Christ that it's [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3303.12s)]
*  got two, both sides of his face have one side of him represents the divinity of Christ. One side [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3308.64s)]
*  represents the humanity of Christ. And in one of the sides, oh, his eye in one side is kind of [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3316.0s)]
*  drooped and it reminded him of this image of Christ. And he got this idea to create this [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3322.88s)]
*  animated short film about the martyrs and their story. And it turned out to be stunning. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3331.04s)]
*  21film.com. People want to see it. It's an, it's an extraordinary short film. Beautiful, beautiful [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3340.0s)]
*  that, that implements Coptic iconography into the, the animation. It was actually on the Oscar [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3349.1200000000003s)]
*  shortlist. It didn't get nominated, but it found its way onto this shortlist of 15 selections. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3356.24s)]
*  And then they whittle it down to the top five. It had no marketing, it had no advertisement, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3361.7599999999998s)]
*  nothing, but somehow I think enough people saw this like, no, this is amazing. And it tells [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3365.44s)]
*  their story and, and the, the mystical nature of their experience and of actually the, their, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3370.8799999999997s)]
*  their captors, what they experienced with these, you know, while they had these guys in captivity [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3381.44s)]
*  and like the, the, the divinely mystical experiences that they had. Are captures? Yeah. Yeah. Are, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3388.32s)]
*  are represented in the short film. In fact, if you haven't seen it, I'll send you a link, but it's, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3395.92s)]
*  it's gorgeous. And at the end of the day, what people walk away with is that these guys had the [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3399.76s)]
*  opportunity to say, no, no, I'm not Christian and then live, but none of them did it. They would, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3407.84s)]
*  they went to their graves literally. And they were just random migrant workers? Migrant workers. Not [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3415.2000000000003s)]
*  evangelists, just people. Christian migrant workers, poor migrant workers, I think construction or [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3421.36s)]
*  farming or something. And, and they, they wouldn't deny their faith. And so I got a chance to screen [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3427.44s)]
*  this film for the first time with the families of the martyrs 10 years later, which was a, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3434.56s)]
*  words fail me because it was such an overwhelmingly powerful experience to be there with them [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3444.96s)]
*  and kind of have them sort of reliving this experience. But when you talk to them [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3453.2799999999997s)]
*  full of joy, full of joy, and they, more than one of them thanked their captors because they, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3461.12s)]
*  they feel, and, and, you know, as Christians, we believe this, that because they died for their [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3473.92s)]
*  faith, they got a straight shot right to the divine, right to God. They're like, we thank them [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3479.04s)]
*  because they sent them right to heaven. So the Coptic church declared them saints. And then very [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3485.68s)]
*  recently, the Catholic church, it's the first time it's happened. Catholic church also considered [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3491.3599999999997s)]
*  them saints because they died for the faith in the way that they die. Yeah. It's so inspirational. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3495.9199999999996s)]
*  It's unbelievable. And so right now I'm trying to get the film out to, for more people to see and [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3501.9199999999996s)]
*  get it out there. So people are aware of, that these stories exist. Like this is a reality for [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3508.7999999999997s)]
*  people, for Christians in the Middle East. This is a reality, you know, that, that their lives are [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3514.72s)]
*  on the line for their beliefs. That's for sure. You know. Time for another True Life Alp story. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3521.12s)]
*  I got a call from a friend of mine yesterday, honestly, true story, who said his girlfriend [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3526.0s)]
*  had just broken up with him over Alp. He wouldn't stop. And I thought to myself, that's kind of sad. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3530.48s)]
*  And he said, no, it's not sad. Imagine if I'd married her. Now I know I was saved. Then the [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3535.12s)]
*  next day, this same friend is driving at twice the speed limit through a major American city, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3543.2s)]
*  pulled over by a cop in a speed trap. Cop takes his license registration, goes back to the patrol car, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3547.3599999999997s)]
*  runs him, comes back, looks in the window and sees a tin of Alp on the dashboard. Pauses. Stunned, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3551.7599999999998s)]
*  says to my friend, you use Alp? Yeah, I do, says my friend. So do I, says the cop. We all do. He looks [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3557.52s)]
*  at my friend thoughtfully and goes, drive safely, sir, and hands back his license and registration. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3563.3599999999997s)]
*  No ticket. So in two days, he's saved from a tragic marriage to a girl who doesn't like Alp [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3567.44s)]
*  and a speeding ticket. All true. It's more than a nicotine marriage. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3573.68s)]
*  In an age of 350 million, people are guessing there are about 350 million Alp stories. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3579.12s)]
*  Email us yours. We want to know and read it on the air. Email tellall at alppouch.com. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3583.28s)]
*  Give us your Alp story. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3590.64s)]
*  You must learn a lot from playing this role. I have. Yeah. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3600.08s)]
*  I've learned how much I have to learn. It's just, I don't know how often we think of Jesus as [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3609.3599999999997s)]
*  fully a man though, as you pointed out, he was. Yeah. What's that like trying to get inside the [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3615.92s)]
*  head of Jesus? Well, I don't think I can ever do it successfully, like completely. I can, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3621.1200000000003s)]
*  the only thing that I, I mean, I, I can't do it successfully at all. The only thing that I can do [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3630.32s)]
*  believing Jesus was fully God and fully man, but sinless in his humanity. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3638.1600000000003s)]
*  The only thing that I can relate to is the humanity part [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3645.28s)]
*  and my own flawed humanity at that deeply flawed, deeply, deeply flawed humanity. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3654.0s)]
*  But luckily I, I don't have to rely on me. I don't rely on me. I rely on him. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3661.1200000000003s)]
*  And so my job is to simply show up, come with a, an open heart. I do a lot of praying and [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3667.44s)]
*  fasting before the every season. I pray before every scene and then [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3680.32s)]
*  do the best that I can to, to simply be, for lack of a better term, a mirror of the divine. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3687.04s)]
*  So I'm like, I just show up and I'm like, I'm just trying to mirror the divine, reading the [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3698.72s)]
*  words that I have, being a vessel for which the Holy Spirit can use me to reach the truth of the [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3705.12s)]
*  gospel to, to the people that watch this show. And, and if it goes beyond entertainment for some [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3713.92s)]
*  people, awesome. I mean, between the show and between the Hallow app, the amount of feedback [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3722.4s)]
*  and changed lives that have occurred, the stories that we get about people that, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3732.96s)]
*  you know, that are, they were, they were atheists all their life and somebody gave them the show. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3743.36s)]
*  And all of a sudden they, something tweaked in their heart. And they're like, why do I feel this [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3750.2400000000002s)]
*  way about this guy? Like, I want to, I want to know this guy. Or people who have been, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3757.52s)]
*  haven't been to church in 30 years, elapsed Catholics, like I haven't been to church in 30 [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3765.1200000000003s)]
*  years. I started going back to church, went to my first confession in 30 years, went to my first [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3772.64s)]
*  confession in 15 years. Like I've heard all of these things. I even went, I was in confession [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3779.12s)]
*  once myself and I, a guy came out of the confessional one. He recognized me. He was like, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3785.92s)]
*  oh yeah. And so he starts talking to me and then he starts, starts to tell me what he was telling [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3792.08s)]
*  the priest in the confession. I said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3797.68s)]
*  you see anything interesting. You keep it in there. I wouldn't let him get that far. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3801.12s)]
*  No, I said, that's, that's not for my ears. Save it for the confessor. So it's, I'm not Catholic, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3806.3999999999996s)]
*  but I've always thought that confession is the coolest thing they do. It's a, it's a gift, man. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3813.12s)]
*  It's a lifesaver. Of course we, when it became psychotherapy and you put like an atheist with [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3820.08s)]
*  bad judgment on the couch across from you, it, I don't think we lost something. Do you know what [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3826.56s)]
*  I mean? Yeah. Yeah. But the human need to connect to unburden yourself, you know what's wrong by the [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3832.24s)]
*  way. Most people know. You don't need to be a Christian to know what's wrong. Everyone know, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3839.84s)]
*  inside you, you know, when you're doing something wrong and to say it out loud, to articulate it in [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3844.24s)]
*  words, is to rid yourself of it to some extent, I think. And then, and then for, for the sacramental [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3848.8s)]
*  part of it, that's, that's where the healing comes in. That's where the spiritual healing comes in. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3858.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's like, it's like if you're a cheesecloth full of holes, right? And you go into confession [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3862.7200000000003s)]
*  and you receive the sacrament of reconciliation from the priest. Now the priest, you know, we [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3870.6400000000003s)]
*  believe he's been given divine authority that has a pot, maybe a not visible, but a tangible physical, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3875.2s)]
*  metaphysical effect on, on the casing of your soul. And it's like mending the little holes. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3884.64s)]
*  Every confession is like you're, you're closing up those holes and restoring that connection [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3892.96s)]
*  with God in a way that, that is essentially repairing your soul. That's, that's what the, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3899.44s)]
*  the sacramental part of confession is for us, which, which is hugely comforting and also [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3908.0s)]
*  physically tangible. For me, I feel just chemically slightly different after every [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3917.12s)]
*  confession that I go through in a way that's like, okay, I can breathe a little easier. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3925.04s)]
*  I believe, I believe that completely. I've never experienced it, but I believe that. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3933.2s)]
*  It's, it's, it's like nothing else. What's it like for you to be recognized on the street for playing [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3937.2s)]
*  Jesus? I know just from having dinner with you last night and telling people you were coming here, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3943.84s)]
*  there's a lot of intensity. Like you're, I've been on television for 30 years. I've never [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3950.64s)]
*  experienced anything like what you experienced, for example, in my house last night. People are [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3956.96s)]
*  very intense when they see you. It's bound up in their feelings for you, but also their feelings [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3961.9199999999996s)]
*  for Jesus. What's that like? I, I give, I give God all the credit. I give Jesus the credit. And, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3967.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, like I'm like, like our buddy Russell Brand, like I was once his stand in, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3974.4s)]
*  I feel like I'm Jesus' stand in. Jesus is the star and I'm his stand in. You're Russell Brand's [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3982.4s)]
*  stand in. I was Russell Brand's stand in. Looking at you, I'm not that surprised. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3987.28s)]
*  If I was casting a stand in for Russell Brand, I think it would be you. Not too bad. It's all [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3992.0800000000004s)]
*  right. And so we had a good time with him. Yeah, he's all right. He's a good mate. Good guy. He's [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=3996.0800000000004s)]
*  a good man. I love that man. I love him so much. I totally agree. But I mean, it, without getting [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4000.56s)]
*  like too personal, it's kind of a fixture of life. Yeah. Yeah. Like maybe not all positive. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4007.52s)]
*  Like what's Whole Foods like for you? Depends on what part of town. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4014.88s)]
*  Probably not too many people watching the shows in Whole Foods, but like a normal, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4021.84s)]
*  non-atheist grocery store. I mean, let's take Whole Foods. So in some parts of the country, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4025.3599999999997s)]
*  I, you know, I got to go in with a hood and glasses and in other parts, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4032.64s)]
*  especially the coastal cities like New York and LA, it's just another day. So it can be- [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4036.64s)]
*  They just take you for a bike messenger, but in Michigan they know. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4045.68s)]
*  No. That's very appropriate. Yeah. That's very appropriate. It can be interesting. I think [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4049.44s)]
*  because of who I'm playing and because there is this oftentimes this front-loaded relationship [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4062.08s)]
*  that they already have with Jesus. And then I become the stand-in, like the face of that [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4072.88s)]
*  relationship that they now, when they read the Bible, I've been told this, my face pops into [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4080.48s)]
*  their mind as they're hearing scriptures or they're seeing, I mean, even for myself, when [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4086.32s)]
*  I'm at mass and the priest is reading the gospel and he's talking about Peter, I'm thinking of [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4090.56s)]
*  Shahar Isaac who plays Peter in our show. And I'm like, okay, yeah, I can't get him out of my head. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4098.4s)]
*  Yeah. But okay. I love Shahar and he's great as Peter. And so, yeah, it's just, you try, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4104.799999999999s)]
*  even as an artist, like you still suffer that, you know, you can't quite make the separation. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4111.599999999999s)]
*  Of course you're being, yeah. Yeah. Because you've, you now have this [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4116.879999999999s)]
*  relationship with these people and these characters. And so to be the face of what is often [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4120.16s)]
*  the most important relationship in a person's life, I mean, even beyond their family, it's like [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4128.0s)]
*  God first and then family and then everything else. To be the face of that for people, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4134.08s)]
*  I don't often, I try not to think about that. Yeah. It's more than being a sidekick on Seinfeld. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4142.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And I think [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4148.64s)]
*  God's given me the gift and the grace of kind of being somewhat blinded to [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4154.4s)]
*  the magnitude of it and the weight of it. That's good. Sometimes I can feel it. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4166.0s)]
*  And most of the time I think I'm shielded from it because I think if I was aware of exactly [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4173.36s)]
*  what that implication was, even for a single person, it would crush me. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4183.2s)]
*  Yeah. Self-awareness is a burden. I would not recommend it at all. I don't have any, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4188.639999999999s)]
*  so it's never bothered me. But I know people who are highly self-aware and they're like [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4192.719999999999s)]
*  in agony all day. Yeah. I mean, other things, I like, I have a lot of that in other areas, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4197.28s)]
*  but when it comes to playing this character, I'm glad I don't have much. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4203.36s)]
*  Smart. Now, so that is a blessing. What is Halo? And how'd you hook up with it? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4207.2s)]
*  Halo is the world's largest and, from my money, the greatest prayer and meditation app a person [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4214.32s)]
*  can ever find. Like ever. There are thousands and thousands of ways, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4224.64s)]
*  prayers and challenges and meditations that people can use in their daily life [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4231.76s)]
*  to the point of automation. They just set it up and you get reminders where you can just [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4240.0s)]
*  connect with God in the most creative ways. For me, it has been [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4246.4s)]
*  a way to keep me completely focused on God when I'm in the middle of life. It's an opportunity for [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4257.759999999999s)]
*  me to access my faith in a consistent way and to get through life's biggest challenges. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4268.4s)]
*  There are so many prayers on this app that I use daily. For instance, there's a prayer called [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4280.719999999999s)]
*  the Surrender Novena. Novena, it's a Latin word, it just means nine days. So it's a prayer you say [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4291.2s)]
*  for nine days. And this particular prayer has been so valuable to so many people. Basically, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4297.2s)]
*  it's very simple, but you repeat it like 10 times. And there's all in the app, like it walks you [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4306.4s)]
*  through it. But the essence of it is this prayer where you simply say, oh Jesus, I surrender myself [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4314.48s)]
*  to you. Take care of everything. Oh Jesus, I surrender myself to you. Take care of everything. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4324.32s)]
*  And you repeat that like 10 times. And the number of people that have experienced profound grace and [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4331.44s)]
*  just ease of their burden, a lightness of the weight in their life, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4344.639999999999s)]
*  it's been, I mean, I've never heard of a prayer that's had such a profound effect, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4350.4s)]
*  like the Rosary is another one. So there was this couple, they were trying to have their first baby. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4357.12s)]
*  They had a miscarriage. They were in a pretty severe state, crisis, depression, everything that [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4364.96s)]
*  comes with that. They see an ad for Hallel. They download the app. They start praying, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4374.16s)]
*  specifically, they start praying the surrender prayer that I was telling you about, the surrender [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4380.72s)]
*  novena and the Rosary. And they were Catholic as well. So they're familiar with them. So they [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4385.12s)]
*  prayed the Rosary, super powerful weapon, and the surrender novena. And they get pregnant again. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4389.12s)]
*  And their relationship is really growing together in faith and in God's strongest [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4398.799999999999s)]
*  that it's ever been. Five months in, they lose the baby. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4403.84s)]
*  And they're holding their past son who had passed away. And the words that come to mind [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4413.04s)]
*  for this woman is the surrender prayer. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4421.28s)]
*  Oh, geez, I surrender myself to you. Take care of everything. It's the first words that come to [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4430.0s)]
*  our mind. And they told us, they said that if they hadn't gotten into this [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4434.639999999999s)]
*  consistent routine of communicating with God through prayer, if their faith hadn't been [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4443.5199999999995s)]
*  strengthened, that second miscarriage would have destroyed their marriage, but it didn't. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4449.28s)]
*  And they kept going. A year later, they had a healthy baby boy. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4458.24s)]
*  And the first words that came out of her mouth that time was the prayer from numbers. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4464.96s)]
*  The Lord bless you and keep you. Lord shine his face upon you. Be gracious to you. The Lord look kindly upon you and give you peace. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4471.28s)]
*  I think this one's name is Jack, I think. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4484.0s)]
*  And so the power of having that relationship, the power of prayer, the power of being in a constant [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4488.48s)]
*  dialogue with God, it's what we were made for. We were designed to worship. We were designed for [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4498.08s)]
*  that relationship. It's in our DNA. And the more we try to ignore it or squash it or bury it or [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4503.92s)]
*  ignore it or pretend it doesn't exist or that it's not there or replace it with something else, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4510.72s)]
*  the more we just run in circles, the more we try to fill that hole with something else, with some other [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4516.96s)]
*  vice, some other endeavor, some other righteous indignation of something, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4523.68s)]
*  some other effort that will never substitute, never replace our need for God. It'll never replace it. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4533.76s)]
*  And so [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4545.6s)]
*  for me, it's like playing Jesus in The Chosen. It's one of the most important things that I've [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4546.08s)]
*  ever done artistically. All of this for me feels like an apostolate. It feels like [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4554.88s)]
*  I'm a media apostle. I feel like that's what I was sent here to do. Like at this time, I was sent here [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4565.2s)]
*  like at this time and place to kind of be a part of this. What I see is this growing [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4573.759999999999s)]
*  movement in film and television, in the culture that is truly counterculture to the current culture. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4581.2s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4589.679999999999s)]
*  And to be a part of the ushering in of this opportunity of expression [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4592.5599999999995s)]
*  that supersedes the previous iterations of what this looked like, because it's so [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4603.5199999999995s)]
*  attentive to quality, like The Chosen aims to be a great TV show first. And because of that, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4611.44s)]
*  the fact that the people making it are really invested in the subject matter, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4624.32s)]
*  the subject matter, make it that much more powerful and then from a very [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4629.2s)]
*  myopically human level, and then God sees that and he takes it and he multiplies it easily. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4637.76s)]
*  He multiplies the magnitude of it. The efficacy of it is then energized and multiplied globally. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4644.96s)]
*  But even just reaching one person and changing one person's life, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4652.8s)]
*  Dallas will tell you this as well. It's worth it just for one person. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4659.52s)]
*  All the discomfort or whatever I may or may not feel in the world as people approach me wanting [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4664.400000000001s)]
*  to take a selfie in the gym or in the supermarket, when I'm clearly trying to like get in and out. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4670.24s)]
*  All of that discomfort for me personally, and I've been through worse. I've been through real [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4679.12s)]
*  discomfort. It's nothing, something, but it's relative. You know what I'm saying? So all of [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4684.639999999999s)]
*  it's worth it, because one person decided to go get baptized. And now they have a whole new life. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4689.92s)]
*  They have a spiritual awakening. It's amazing to me how successful it's been, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4699.36s)]
*  and it's amazing to me the reaction to it. Banned in China. It's not calling for the overthrow of [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4705.36s)]
*  the CCP. It's not calling for the... HALO app is banned in China. HALO app is banned in China. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4713.599999999999s)]
*  It's also effectively banned in Europe, in effect because Mark Zuckerberg's company Metta has [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4718.5599999999995s)]
*  shut down all advertising for religious oriented faith-based advertising. So it can't operate in [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4724.08s)]
*  Europe. Yeah, that was a tough one. They had just launched in Polish and Italian and German [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4731.52s)]
*  and all these languages, and now people can't know about the app because they've banned it. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4737.92s)]
*  Why is that a threat? I mean, it just does tell you everything, right? I mean, it's like [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4744.4800000000005s)]
*  understanding things in reverse. It's like, why would they be upset with that? That's like the [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4751.200000000001s)]
*  kindest least threatening, only want to help people. Like, why is that bad? Yeah, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4757.76s)]
*  I'd be curious to hear the EU's answer for that. Or Metta's answer for that. Yeah, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4764.24s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg's answer for that. And China's answer for that. What's wrong with that? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4768.16s)]
*  Yeah. It tells you a lot, but you don't seem shocked by that at all. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4774.72s)]
*  No. No, you're not. I mean, when you read of the stories for decades of people smuggling [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4779.599999999999s)]
*  Bibles into countries, underground churches, even in the story that we cover in the Pray [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4784.32s)]
*  40 Challenge for Hallow, it's the story of this guy, Takashi Nagai. I mean, he was living in [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4792.639999999999s)]
*  Nagasaki, Japan, right around the time of the Second World War when the bomb was dropped [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4799.44s)]
*  on his town, on Nagasaki. And Japan had just come out of 300 years, basically, of Christian [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4807.360000000001s)]
*  persecution. They had gotten rid of any... I mean, I think in the late 16th century, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4817.6s)]
*  they were crucifying people. Oh, yeah. And then 300 plus years later, Nagasaki is now [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4828.320000000001s)]
*  the largest Christian hub in all of Japan. And it wasn't the first target for the bomb. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4838.56s)]
*  No. They tried to drop the bomb somewhere else. This is all in the story that people [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4845.360000000001s)]
*  hear about this length. It's an amazing story. This man's story is amazing. Takashi Nagai, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4848.56s)]
*  he's a radiologist, doctor. The first target, they tried to drop the bomb and it was too cloudy. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4854.48s)]
*  They couldn't see and they didn't have the conditions appropriate to drop an atomic bomb. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4862.639999999999s)]
*  So their second target was Nagasaki, oddly enough, right above a cathedral. And it blew up, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4868.5599999999995s)]
*  detonated right over the cathedral and wiped out everything. And he survived. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4880.08s)]
*  Nobody else, his family, everybody died. Killed the majority of the Christians in [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4885.599999999999s)]
*  Nagasaki, which was the Christian capital of Japan. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, it killed... [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4889.28s)]
*  Love to hear an answer for why people are very enthusiastic about that and think it's great. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4894.08s)]
*  I don't think it's great. And I think there should be a law that American armaments can't be used to [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4897.44s)]
*  murder Christians abroad. That's pretty simple. But I agree. There was a thing that I wanted to [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4903.2s)]
*  read that he said right after the bombing, which he had converted from atheism. He was Shinto and [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4909.599999999999s)]
*  then he was atheist and then he converted to Christianity and Catholicism. And he was influenced [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4916.639999999999s)]
*  by the writings of Blaise Pascal. So he gave a speech to his community. He was one of the very [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4923.36s)]
*  few survivors in his community. And this just goes to show you the resilience and the mindset [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4930.88s)]
*  of him and how having faith can completely change the perspective, especially when [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4938.32s)]
*  you're effectively living in hell on earth, which is what Nagasaki was after the dropping of the [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4949.92s)]
*  bomb. People were walking around asking for water while their skin is melting off. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4955.52s)]
*  Like it's literal hell on earth. He said, I have heard that the atom bomb was destined for another [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4960.88s)]
*  city. Heavy clouds rendered that target impossible. And the American crew headed for the secondary [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4968.4800000000005s)]
*  target, Nagasaki. Then a mechanical problem arose and the bomb was dropped further north than planned [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4975.76s)]
*  and burst right above the cathedral. It was not the American crew, I believe, who chose our suburb. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4986.0s)]
*  God's providence chose Urakami, the suburb, and carried the bomb right above our homes. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=4994.4s)]
*  Is there not a profound relationship between the annihilation of Nagasaki [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5002.16s)]
*  and the end of the war? Was not Nagasaki the chosen victim, the lamb without blemish, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5007.28s)]
*  slain as a whole burnt offering on an altar of sacrifice, atoning for the sins of all the [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5015.280000000001s)]
*  nations during World War II? Happy are those who weep. They shall be comforted. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5021.52s)]
*  We must walk the way of reparation. But we can turn our minds eyes to Jesus carrying his cross [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5033.4400000000005s)]
*  up the hill of Calvary. The Lord has given, the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5041.2s)]
*  Lord. Let us be thankful that Nagasaki was chosen for the whole burnt sacrifice. Let us be thankful [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5049.28s)]
*  that through this sacrifice, peace was granted to the world and religious freedom to Japan. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5057.2s)]
*  So, for people who haven't heard it, tell us what you do for Hallow. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5064.08s)]
*  So, I am one of the main voices on Hallow for prayers. So, if you want to pray a specific prayer, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5086.799999999999s)]
*  chances are I've recorded it and you can hear me pray it or for any of the challenges like the [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5096.4s)]
*  the Pray 40 Challenge. I will be guiding people through this challenge, telling people about [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5104.08s)]
*  Takashi Nagae's story. And I'm also kind of a creative advisor as well and come to them with [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5109.52s)]
*  ideas and work with them on different things that they're doing. And yeah, I love working with them. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5119.200000000001s)]
*  They've been such great partners and I think the reason is that they're believers themselves. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5127.120000000001s)]
*  They're doing this. I mean, you had Alex on the show and you heard his story. I mean, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5134.88s)]
*  he originally created the app for himself and God took that desire and that intention in his heart [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5140.88s)]
*  and then amplified it. And now it's the largest prayer app in the world. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5149.92s)]
*  It's a frequent conversation in my house. I told you yesterday, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5156.8s)]
*  my wife's very kind, never scolds me for anything. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5160.0s)]
*  But when she saw my schedule and saw you were coming and that we hadn't invited you for dinner, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5163.599999999999s)]
*  she actually did bark at me because she's like your biggest fan. What? What? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5167.12s)]
*  Pretty detached from my schedule. But yeah, so yes. Thank God for your wife. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5173.679999999999s)]
*  Not the first time I've thought that. Thank you. It has really been wonderful the last 24 hours to [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5179.759999999999s)]
*  talk to you and it's been my honor. Thank you very much. Thanks Tucker. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5186.639999999999s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show on one level. That's not surprising. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5195.04s)]
*  That's what they do. But on another level, it's shocking with everything that's going on in the [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5199.92s)]
*  world right now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5203.679999999999s)]
*  one the cusp of fighting right now. Google has decided you should have less information [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5208.8s)]
*  rather than more. And that is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5214.0s)]
*  we could whine about it. That's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5220.72s)]
*  way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5224.4s)]
*  deceptive. The way to do that on YouTube, we think it's to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5229.2s)]
*  hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5234.56s)]
*  a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoO46OOztI&t=5239.76s)]
