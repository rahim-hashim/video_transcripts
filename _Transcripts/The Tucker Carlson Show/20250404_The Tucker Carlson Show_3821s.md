# Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Breaks Down Trump's Tariff Plan and Its Impact on the Middle Class
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI)
*  Mr. Trey, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=0.0s)]
*  So we're at the Treasury Department. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2.92s)]
*  The president had a press conference yesterday next door in which he announced a whole new [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3.92s)]
*  tariff regime global. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=9.72s)]
*  He'd been promising to do this for 40 years, really. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=12.36s)]
*  It came not out of nowhere, but it was clearly his intent all along as stated. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=15.82s)]
*  But it did rattle people, including some of his supporters. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=20.16s)]
*  So I just wanted to ask you, big picture, where do you think this leads? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=23.1s)]
*  Hello, Tucker, and thank you for having me. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=27.96s)]
*  And as you said, the president's been talking about this for four decades. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=31.0s)]
*  And this is transformational for the American economy, for the American worker, and for [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=34.52s)]
*  the new Republican alignment. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=41.08s)]
*  And it's a combination of the old and new ideas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=43.88s)]
*  Some of the old ideas were put away. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  I always tell everyone, and they don't want to hear it, the original tariff man was Alexander [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Hamilton. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  And he used tariffs to fund the new nation and to protect American industry. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  President Trump has added a third leg to the stool, and he uses tariffs to negotiate. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=63.12s)]
*  But I think this is not unlike, I was a freshman in college when Ronald Reagan came in in 1980, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=68.48s)]
*  and a new day in America. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=75.92s)]
*  And when I talk to people now, and they look back and they look at the Reagan years so [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=78.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  I remember what it was like. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  And it was choppy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  And the president Very choppy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  Very choppy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=90.91999999999999s)]
*  President Reagan stood the course. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  And look, this is not an invitation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=93.52s)]
*  But at one point in the early 80s, a farmer showed up with a shotgun at the Federal Reserve [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=95.82s)]
*  to kill Paul Volcker for raising rates. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=102.32s)]
*  So like I said, that's not an invitation for anybody for action. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=106.16s)]
*  It was a tough time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=111.36s)]
*  And then in 1984, President Reagan won reelection with 49 states. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  And I think they may have even let Mondale win Minnesota just so it wasn't a skunk. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Just to be nice. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=125.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=126.88s)]
*  And that's what President Trump is doing now for years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=127.88s)]
*  The American worker, middle middle class has been eviscerated. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=131.88s)]
*  American workers have taken it on the chin. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=137.6s)]
*  And we're just starting to see some of the research now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=140.16s)]
*  We're seeing research on what's called the China shock from 2004. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=143.84s)]
*  It's just coming out now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=149.2s)]
*  And it's what you know, it's what I know. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=150.76s)]
*  But finally, academics are saying, oh, the gosh, the American workers never recovered [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=153.28s)]
*  from the China shock. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  What a surprise. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=161.64s)]
*  President Trump sensed it 40 years ago. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=163.66s)]
*  But out in the campaign trail, starting in 2015, up until last year, he has promised [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=167.1s)]
*  the American workers that the old standard of living can come back. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=174.06s)]
*  And because what we've seen over the past at least 20 years since the China shock, but [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=180.26000000000002s)]
*  more like the past 30, are these massive distributional problems where the coast have done great. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=192.45999999999998s)]
*  And the middle of the country has just seen quality of life, life expectancy decline. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  They don't think their children are going to do better than they are. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=201.42s)]
*  And a lot of people don't care. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  And President Trump cares, this administration cares. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=206.77999999999997s)]
*  And this is the first step towards realigning that a lot of our trading partners, including [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  some of our allies, have not been good partners. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  If tariffs are so bad, why do they have them? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=220.14s)]
*  My question. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=223.05999999999997s)]
*  Why do they have them? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=224.42s)]
*  Or if the American consumer is going to pay all the tariff, then why do they care about [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=226.42s)]
*  tariffs? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=231.17999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  Because they're going to eat them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  So I think that this is the beginning of a process. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=234.42s)]
*  We're going to reindustrialize. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=239.77999999999997s)]
*  That we have gone to a highly financialized economy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=242.61999999999998s)]
*  We have stopped making things, especially a lot of things that are relevant for national [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=246.86s)]
*  security. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=254.22000000000003s)]
*  I think one of the few good outcomes from COVID was we had a beta test for what maybe [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=255.22000000000003s)]
*  a kinetic war with a large adversary could look like. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=264.06s)]
*  And it turned out that these highly efficient supply chains were not strategically secure. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=269.1s)]
*  So that we don't make our own medicines, that we don't make our own semiconductors, that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=276.02s)]
*  we don't make our own ships anymore. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=280.86s)]
*  So I think if I were to say, was there any good outcome from COVID? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=284.02s)]
*  It woke the world up to these supply chain problems. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=290.46s)]
*  So economic security is national security. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=294.42s)]
*  President Trump and I have talked about that a lot. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=298.38s)]
*  So this is a national security issue that we're seeing here, but it's also an economic [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=300.97999999999996s)]
*  security issue. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=306.41999999999996s)]
*  And it's to, I don't want to say redistribute, but it is to give working Americans real wage [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=307.97999999999996s)]
*  gains and enhance their lives. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  I've said out on the campaign trail, one of my most frequent mottos was Wall Street's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=322.94s)]
*  done great. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=331.58s)]
*  It can continue doing well, but it's Main Street's turn. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=333.65999999999997s)]
*  It's Main Street's turn. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=337.02s)]
*  And that's what we saw yesterday. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=339.06s)]
*  It's Main Street's turn. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=341.06s)]
*  So over the course of my life, 55 years, Wall Street really has been the commonly recognized [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=343.38s)]
*  measure of economic health. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=350.18s)]
*  Like, how's the Dow doing? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=351.34s)]
*  We've got entire TV channels devoted to tracking its progress, which has mostly been up during [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=352.74s)]
*  the course of my life. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=357.46s)]
*  So if the equity averages fall, if the stock market falls, that's seen by a lot of people [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=358.02s)]
*  as like a measure that the economy itself is in decline. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=366.7s)]
*  Do you think that's a fair measure? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  Look, the market goes up and down. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=370.78s)]
*  Warren Buffett has this saying, in the short run, the market's a voting machine. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=374.97999999999996s)]
*  In the long run, it's a weighing machine. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=379.86s)]
*  And in the long run, it's going to weigh, do we have good policies? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=381.94s)]
*  And in my former business, I commented on market structure, market ups and downs a lot. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=385.62s)]
*  I'm trying not to do that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=394.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=396.14s)]
*  But for everyone who thinks that these market declines are all based on the president's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=396.94s)]
*  economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=403.38s)]
*  announcement of DeepSeek. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=410.1s)]
*  So the so-called Mag-7, the tech stocks, have been doing very well for about 18 months, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=412.18s)]
*  led the market. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=419.14s)]
*  And I think that there's kind of a real dose of reality in what was going on in AI. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=421.1s)]
*  I think the US is going to remain the leader in AI, but the AI-related stocks started coming down. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=429.1s)]
*  So if I were to analyze in my old hat, and this is the only time I'm going to talk about it, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=437.14000000000004s)]
*  my old hat, what's happening with the market, I'd say it's more a Mag-7 problem and not a Magger problem. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=442.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=448.42s)]
*  So it's a deeper... [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=449.1s)]
*  So actually, the markets are, you're saying in this specific case with tech stocks, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=450.98s)]
*  are taking like a real measure of the value of companies relative to foreign companies. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=456.1s)]
*  Well, it's sad, but if we look at the equal-weighted S&P, even after today's move, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=460.7s)]
*  down 4% in the year, in a long-term chart, you wouldn't even notice that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=466.9s)]
*  And I think the most important thing that we can do, that I can do as the Treasury Secretary, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=472.14s)]
*  that President Trump wants to do, is put in sound fundamentals for the underlying economy. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=477.42s)]
*  And if the underlying economy is good, if taxes are stable, if businesses have predictability, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=484.70000000000005s)]
*  if we have cheap and plentiful energy, if we deregulate, if we treat our workforce well, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=490.70000000000005s)]
*  then we're going to have a great stock market. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=497.74s)]
*  Fair. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=500.98s)]
*  The President suggested in describing his plan for tariffs, he said, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=502.74s)]
*  look, you could conceivably fund a lot of government with tariffs. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=507.22s)]
*  And that would suggest that taxpayers fund less of the burden. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=511.06s)]
*  And so do you expect that these will be accompanied by a congressionally-approved tax cut for the middle class? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=515.66s)]
*  So, and, Toda, I just want to go back for a moment, too, that one of the things that the tariffs are doing [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=524.26s)]
*  is we are pushing back against other economic systems. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=530.38s)]
*  So the Chinese have a very different economic system. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=534.34s)]
*  They have low costs, some would call it literally slave labor. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=537.62s)]
*  They subsidize industry with subsidized loans. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=542.3s)]
*  They have a lot of non-tariff barriers. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=547.54s)]
*  Your show can't be shown there. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=551.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=554.02s)]
*  So we're pushing back against that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=554.66s)]
*  And with the tariff income, it can be substantial. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=559.54s)]
*  And if we think like a classical model of tariff income would say if there's a 10% tariff, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=563.5s)]
*  then the currency would appreciate about 40% of that, so 4% of it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=571.46s)]
*  Then the producer in the other country would eat about 4%. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=577.4200000000001s)]
*  And then the US consumer might have a one-time price adjustment of 2%. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=583.0600000000001s)]
*  So in a 10% tariff, maybe the consumer pays 2% of it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=588.9s)]
*  We saw there's a study out recently from a group at MIT that shows that with President Trump's first China tariffs, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=596.3s)]
*  which were approximately 20%, the price level went up 0.7%. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=603.9399999999999s)]
*  So to answer your question, if we could put on a 20% tariff and have the foreigners pay that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=609.06s)]
*  and use that money to bring down our government deficit and keep taxes low here, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=619.2199999999999s)]
*  that's a very unique formula that hasn't been tried in this country for a long time. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=625.3s)]
*  And do you think that it would require congressional participation to get there, to move tax rates, of course, are set by the Congress. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=629.78s)]
*  Well, what we're going to have now, we are in this very odd, what I would call betwixt and between, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=635.78s)]
*  between the tariff income and what DOGE is doing in terms of the cutting government expenses. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=642.74s)]
*  So CBO scoring, and for 35 years, I was on the other side of the wall, and I would always say, oh, well, CBO says this. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=650.1s)]
*  And I didn't really realize that kind of CBO scoring is a lot like Enron accounting, that it's not real. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=659.3000000000001s)]
*  And when you actually look at the real story... [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=666.4200000000001s)]
*  But you assumed it was on the outside? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=668.82s)]
*  Sure. Well, they're experts. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=670.58s)]
*  It's a congressional budget office. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=673.0600000000001s)]
*  It's a congressional budget office. And they're well-intentioned people. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=674.34s)]
*  They just have the nonsensical rules. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=678.74s)]
*  Like, think about this, when all the scoring is done over a 10-year window. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=681.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=687.38s)]
*  So they just assume 1.7 or 1.8% economic growth over the 10 years. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=688.26s)]
*  And that never moves. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=695.22s)]
*  Whether you raise taxes or cut taxes doesn't move. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=697.06s)]
*  So that's what, like, during the campaign, when Vice President Harris was announcing all these big tax increases [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=702.58s)]
*  she wanted to do and things like that, that the CBO was scoring her very well. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=709.46s)]
*  And President Trump wants to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=715.22s)]
*  That was kind of a blowout number because obviously growth is going to go up a lot when you cut taxes. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=722.42s)]
*  So that was a long way of saying we will not get credit for the tariffs in any bill [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=729.62s)]
*  because Congress is not going to legislate it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=738.98s)]
*  The President is doing it with executive authority. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=741.62s)]
*  But the money will be coming in. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=745.54s)]
*  We've already taken in several hundred million dollars on the China tariffs from his first term. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=747.54s)]
*  We've taken in about $35 billion a year just on the old tariffs, not on the new ones. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=754.18s)]
*  So in the CBO window, that's about $350 billion, which pays for a lot of the President's promises [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=760.98s)]
*  no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=770.9s)]
*  making interest deductibility on autos made in the U.S. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=776.9s)]
*  And think what the President's doing here. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=781.38s)]
*  He is backing into an affordability solution for the bottom 50 percent of wagers [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=783.54s)]
*  because they're the ones who will benefit from all four of those programs. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=791.62s)]
*  So looking at say a year from now, so beginning of next April, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=796.02s)]
*  do you have any sense of how much the U.S. government anticipates [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=801.3s)]
*  bringing in from the tariffs announced yesterday? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=804.3399999999999s)]
*  It's going to be a moving target. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=807.9399999999999s)]
*  But could it be anywhere from $300 billion to $600 billion a year? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=810.74s)]
*  Sure. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=816.42s)]
*  Okay, so that's meaningful revenue. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=817.6999999999999s)]
*  Very meaningful. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=820.02s)]
*  But what will happen with tariffs over time, the ultimate goal of the tariffs, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=821.3s)]
*  and the President says all the time, bring your factory here. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=826.34s)]
*  That's the best solution toward getting away from a tariff wall. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=830.66s)]
*  So move your factory from China, from Mexico, from Vietnam, bring it here. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=836.1800000000001s)]
*  So what will happen over time? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=843.94s)]
*  We'll have substantial tariff income in the beginning. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=845.54s)]
*  Manufacturers will build their factory here. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=848.58s)]
*  The tariffs will drop, but the revenue from the factories, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=851.46s)]
*  the income taxes from all the new jobs will go up. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=856.26s)]
*  So we'll be taking it in domestically as the tariffs drop. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=860.74s)]
*  And why are the tariffs dropping? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=866.4200000000001s)]
*  Because we're making it here and our trade deficit's dropping. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=867.94s)]
*  So you've obviously thought this through. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=872.82s)]
*  You think that the United States has the necessary labor force for this transition? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=875.2199999999999s)]
*  I think we do. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=881.2199999999999s)]
*  I think with AI, with automation, with so many of these factories are going to be new. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=882.02s)]
*  They're going to be smart factories that I think we've got all the labor force we need. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=889.8599999999999s)]
*  And what we are doing on the other side, one of the reasons, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=896.02s)]
*  other than my support for President Trump, that I came out from behind my desk, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=900.1s)]
*  and I had a pretty good life. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=907.94s)]
*  And I wanted to come out and really tell people that I was worried about an impending [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=910.26s)]
*  financial calamity given the high levels of government spending that were leading to high [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=918.1800000000001s)]
*  levels of government debt. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=923.0600000000001s)]
*  So what we are doing, on one side, the president is reordering trade. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=924.98s)]
*  On the other side, we are shedding excess labor in the federal government and bringing down [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=930.98s)]
*  federal borrowings. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=940.74s)]
*  And then on the other side, that will give us the labor that we need for the new manufacturing. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=942.1800000000001s)]
*  And we're going to re-lever the private sector. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=948.26s)]
*  So the private sector, in essence, has been in recession during the Biden years. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=952.66s)]
*  And this is an opportunity to right-size the federal government and unleash the private [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=957.6999999999999s)]
*  sector again because it's been hemmed down by excessive regulation and it's been crowded [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=964.5799999999999s)]
*  out by the government. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=970.42s)]
*  Here's a fact of life you may not learn until you're older, but I'm going to tell you now. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=972.26s)]
*  It's very hard to have a good time if you're wearing bad boots. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=975.86s)]
*  In fact, it may be impossible, and that's why you need to COVID. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=979.38s)]
*  As a matter of fact, you don't just need them, you owe them to yourself. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=982.66s)]
*  Tukovas makes Western boots for everybody. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=985.54s)]
*  Ranchers, real ranchers, lifelong cowboys, first-time boot buyers, and anyone in between. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=988.3399999999999s)]
*  Every Tukovas boot is handcrafted, made by hand, with over 200 meticulous steps for a [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=993.78s)]
*  broken-in feel right out of the box. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1000.26s)]
*  You don't have to compromise between looks and quality. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1002.18s)]
*  You can have them both. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1005.38s)]
*  Whether it's a long day or a big night, Tukovas are built to last and impressed. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1006.5799999999999s)]
*  You wouldn't believe the compliments people here get when they wear them out, which they do. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1011.14s)]
*  Right now, get 10% off at tukovas.com slash tucker when you sign up for email and text alerts. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1015.38s)]

*  Do you ever think, since your job is to, part of your job is to forecast the effects of [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1026.26s)]
*  these policies, that you have, we've got probably one out of six people in this country here [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1030.58s)]
*  illegally, maybe 50 million illegal aliens, and the president said he wants to deport him. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1036.74s)]
*  Then you have AI, and the projections there are massive labor market disruption, fewer [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1041.86s)]
*  people needed. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1047.38s)]
*  You alluded to that a minute ago. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1047.94s)]
*  Then you have the tariffs, and we can guess it's their effect, but we don't really know [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1050.26s)]
*  because we've never done it. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1054.34s)]
*  And then you have the reaction from the rest of the world to those tariffs. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1056.18s)]
*  There's so many huge factors that are effectively unknown, that are black boxes. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1059.06s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1064.1s)]
*  Do you ever think, wow, it's kind of hard to know what's going to happen? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1064.74s)]
*  Look, it is, and I always think that you can never be 100% sure, but you can stay [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1068.5s)]
*  within sight of guardrails and keep moving forward. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1079.14s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1083.86s)]
*  One of the Sunday morning shows I was on a couple weeks ago, the commentator asked me, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1084.9s)]
*  she said, can you guarantee me there won't be a recession? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1090.9s)]
*  I said, I can't guarantee you anything. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1094.34s)]
*  There's nothing that tells me there should be one. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1096.6599999999999s)]
*  So I believe that this is going to work, just like President Reagan believed that supply [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1099.4599999999998s)]
*  side economics was going to work. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1106.26s)]
*  But what I do know is that the old system wasn't working. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1109.3799999999999s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1114.82s)]
*  And if you look at a system that's not working, you've got to be brave to change it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1115.78s)]
*  So what wasn't working? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1120.74s)]
*  It would have been really fun for me to come in and just keep issuing a lot of debt. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1122.02s)]
*  And it's almost like a bodybuilder is taking steroids. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1128.5s)]
*  Outside looks great. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1132.74s)]
*  You're muscular. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1135.3799999999999s)]
*  Inside, you're killing your vital organs. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1136.42s)]
*  That's what was going on here. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1138.82s)]
*  But it would have been easy to keep pumping up the economy, borrowing a lot of money, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1140.18s)]
*  creating a lot of government jobs. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1145.94s)]
*  There was no controversy when we're doing all that. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1149.06s)]
*  And they had, but you were going to end up in a calamity. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1152.34s)]
*  If you go back and look, you look at the financial crisis in 07, 08, economy looked great right [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1155.86s)]
*  up until then. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1166.34s)]
*  You go back and you look at the end of the dot com bubble and then the whole credit problem, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1167.46s)]
*  the fraud at WorldCom and Ron and some other companies, economy looked great until it didn't. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1174.02s)]
*  And I think one of the things that we won't get credit for, but that this administration [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1180.8200000000002s)]
*  will have done is avoiding a financial calamity. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1187.38s)]
*  Think about it that they've done an analysis that one of the reasons 9-11 happened because [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1192.3400000000001s)]
*  the airlines didn't want to pay for reinforced doors. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1198.9s)]
*  They kept pushing back. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1202.66s)]
*  FAA didn't push hard enough. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1204.18s)]
*  And now we've got the reinforced doors. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1206.26s)]
*  So I look at it, we're putting on the reinforced doors before the crash. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1209.14s)]
*  What's the scramble, the lobbying scramble by foreign governments going to be like over [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1215.5400000000002s)]
*  the next three months? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1218.98s)]
*  Because the president said yesterday, you know, we're putting a universal tariff, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1220.0200000000002s)]
*  you know, one standard, but then of course, each country's adjusted according to a lot [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1223.0600000000002s)]
*  of different factors, trade deficit, currency manipulation, regulation, and then tariffs. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1226.66s)]
*  But, you know, this is all, as you said, a moving picture. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1231.0600000000002s)]
*  It's a developing situation. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1233.94s)]
*  So like, if I pick a country, you know, Vietnam, China, I mean, I'm going to really try to [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1236.18s)]
*  bring pressure to bear on this administration to adjust those numbers. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1244.5800000000002s)]
*  Like, what's that going to be like? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1247.78s)]
*  It's going to be the president's decision. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1249.78s)]
*  And I think his view is this has been going on for a long time for friends and foes. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1251.7s)]
*  And we're going to see where this plays out. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1258.66s)]
*  I think what's going to be more important than the discussion with countries is the [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1262.18s)]
*  discussion with companies. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1267.38s)]
*  So what do companies want to do? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1269.46s)]
*  As President Trump said yesterday, best way to get around the tariffs, build your factory here. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1271.6200000000001s)]
*  And what can we do here at Treasury to help that? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1277.46s)]
*  We're pushing to get the tax bill done so we can guarantee the low taxes, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1282.5s)]
*  full depreciation within the first year. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1289.22s)]
*  We're working with Secretary's Bergman right on energy security. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1292.1s)]
*  And we're working on getting the regulations down. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1297.86s)]
*  President, I don't know whether we talked about it yesterday or the day before, Taiwan semi [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1302.1s)]
*  or just semiconductor manufacturer in the world, Lee Zeldin, the EPA commissioner, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1307.22s)]
*  is working to push through all the permits that they need because we've just [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1313.6999999999998s)]
*  gone into this regulatory morass where it takes so long to get things done in this country. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1318.1s)]
*  So I think what will be more interesting are the individual company announcements more than [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1323.62s)]
*  the country announcements. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1330.98s)]
*  You want to sell to Americans, you got to make it in America. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1332.02s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1335.2199999999998s)]
*  Or pay the tariffs. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1335.6999999999998s)]
*  So how is China as a nation going to, I mean, this is such a big challenge. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1337.9399999999998s)]
*  It's directly in their face. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1342.02s)]
*  It's about every country on the globe, but it's really more than any other country about China. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1343.1399999999999s)]
*  I think it's fair to say. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1347.54s)]
*  How are they going to respond? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1348.8999999999999s)]
*  What's the retaliation look like? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1349.78s)]
*  Well, I don't know if they can retaliate for a couple of reasons. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1351.86s)]
*  If you look at the history, and I used to teach economic history. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1355.1399999999999s)]
*  And when you look at the history, we are the debtor nation. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1360.34s)]
*  We have the trade deficits. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1365.62s)]
*  The surplus nation is in the weaker position because the Chinese business model, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1368.5s)]
*  and Tucker, by the way, the Chinese business model and the economy are the most unbalanced, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1374.18s)]
*  imbalanced in the history of the modern world. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1379.6200000000001s)]
*  We've never seen anything like this in terms of their export level relative to their GDP, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1382.18s)]
*  relative to their population. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1388.9s)]
*  So I think it is going to be very difficult for them to try to change the model. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1390.8200000000002s)]
*  They're trying, they're in a deflationary recession slash depression right now. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1396.74s)]
*  They're trying to export their way out of it, and we can't let them do that. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1402.42s)]
*  But I think that when you think the Chinese manufacturing system is like that old Disney [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1406.5s)]
*  movie with the brooms carrying the buckets. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1411.38s)]
*  There's nothing you can do. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1414.26s)]
*  That's their business model. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1415.7s)]
*  It's not going to stop. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1417.38s)]
*  Now, what could happen if you were to say, Scott, what's the dream scenario that somehow [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1419.22s)]
*  there could be a deal where the US and China, we want more manufacturing, which would mean [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1428.6599999999999s)]
*  smaller part of the economy's consumption. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1436.1799999999998s)]
*  The Chinese have this imbalanced economy with too much manufacturing. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1438.6599999999999s)]
*  And actually the Chinese consumers really get the short end of the stick. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1443.6999999999998s)]
*  So Chinese households, they're caught in what's called the middle income trap [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1450.02s)]
*  that could we do something together to say, okay, you rebalance, you consume more, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1456.82s)]
*  manufacture less, we are going to consume less and manufacture more. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1465.54s)]
*  And we'll be military rivals. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1471.3799999999999s)]
*  There'll still be an economic rivalry, but we're going to level the playing field by a lot. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1474.98s)]
*  Now, that's not going to happen tomorrow. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1480.26s)]
*  That's not going to happen in a month. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1483.22s)]
*  But over the next few years, they may have to come around because I think their business [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1485.46s)]
*  model is broken. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1491.3s)]
*  I think President Trump's broken their business model with these tariffs. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1492.42s)]
*  So you're describing the famous scenario where if you take a bank loan, the bank is in charge. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1495.94s)]
*  They can repossess whatever you borrowed against. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1500.5s)]
*  But if you take a big enough loan, you're kind of in charge of the bank. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1503.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1506.3400000000001s)]
*  And they've just got such a big deficit with us that- [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1507.94s)]
*  They need our markets. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1512.74s)]
*  They can't survive without. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1514.26s)]
*  Are you confident that there's like a clear enough channel of communication [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1517.62s)]
*  between the two governments that the details can be worked out and that nothing will go crazy [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1520.6599999999999s)]
*  in the meantime? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1524.7399999999998s)]
*  Well, I think what gives me a lot of confidence is the relationship between President Trump [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1525.4599999999998s)]
*  and Chairman Xi. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1531.86s)]
*  When you have a direct line of communication at the very top, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1534.26s)]
*  then I think it's very difficult for things to go haywire. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1539.1399999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1542.7399999999998s)]
*  What about the rest of the world? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1543.62s)]
*  What about Europe? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1544.82s)]
*  Look, the Europeans, we look back and there was a famous meeting where President Trump [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1546.8999999999999s)]
*  told the Europeans that you're insane for building Nord Stream 2. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1555.3s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1559.3799999999999s)]
*  You already get most of your energy from Russia and you're going to double down on it? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1560.5s)]
*  And they did. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1564.9799999999998s)]
*  And look what happened. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1566.26s)]
*  So- [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1567.86s)]
*  We blew it up. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1568.34s)]
*  Somebody did. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1570.02s)]
*  Probably Putin! [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1572.34s)]
*  But some Norwegian fishermen bumped into it is what I read. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1574.1799999999998s)]
*  But look, the Europeans go kicking and screaming, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1580.6599999999999s)]
*  but I think they're going to have to rebalance too. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1586.1799999999998s)]
*  Germany has a very imbalanced export economy and they were on the verge of deindustrialization. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1588.82s)]
*  They were the opposite of us. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1598.1s)]
*  They had expensive energy. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1599.54s)]
*  They were depending on Italy and the countries in the south to keep the euro suppressed. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1602.26s)]
*  And they were selling into China and now China is becoming their competitor. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1608.34s)]
*  So you said at the outset, the first example of the analogy that you used was [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1615.86s)]
*  President Reagan's first term, obviously big win in 80, recession of 82, wipeout, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1621.06s)]
*  and then like the biggest landslide in history in 84. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1627.7s)]
*  You're suggesting by saying that that the fruits were obvious within the first term, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1631.46s)]
*  within four years. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1636.02s)]
*  They were. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1637.46s)]
*  Only difference now is there was a lot of competition back then, but there's a level of civility. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1638.74s)]
*  And the real danger here, if there were a midterm loss, and I don't think there has to be, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1645.5400000000002s)]
*  you know what's going to happen, I know what's going to happen, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1652.8200000000002s)]
*  Democratic House is going to go immediately to impeachment for something. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1654.9s)]
*  Of course. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1658.3400000000001s)]
*  The law fair is going to start again. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1659.22s)]
*  And I think the American people are going to hate it again. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1662.42s)]
*  So Einstein's definition of insanity, doing the same thing again and again, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1665.14s)]
*  and expecting a different outcome. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1669.8600000000001s)]
*  Do you think that, and this is really aimed at the people who support President Trump [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1670.9s)]
*  and who agree with you wholeheartedly that the current system was really bad and like [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1676.42s)]
*  drive across the country, you'll see how bad it has been, horrible. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1680.26s)]
*  It lowered life expectancy. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1683.8600000000001s)]
*  But the people who are hoping that yesterday's move will lead to a demonstrably brighter [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1685.14s)]
*  future within four years. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1691.14s)]
*  Is it your sincere prediction that within four years we'll say, actually, that kind of worked? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1693.0600000000002s)]
*  I believe that it's going to work. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1699.22s)]
*  And I know that what we were doing wasn't working. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1703.3000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1706.1000000000001s)]
*  So I think we have to try this. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1706.5s)]
*  And I have a high confidence ratio. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1710.0200000000002s)]
*  It's going to work. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1712.9s)]
*  And I have a very high confidence ratio. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1714.18s)]
*  The good news is we have President Trump's previous term when everyone said none of this [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1716.98s)]
*  was going to work. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1722.1000000000001s)]
*  Oh, the China terrorists are going to do this. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1723.3s)]
*  They're going to cause inflation. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1725.14s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1726.9s)]
*  This is going to happen to working class. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1728.5s)]
*  It's going to be bad for working class Americans. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1731.14s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1733.46s)]
*  Working class Americans, the hourly workers did better than supervisory workers. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1734.42s)]
*  The bottom 50% of households, their net worth increased faster than the top 10% of households. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1740.34s)]
*  And I'm not happy with what's going on in the market today. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1748.1s)]
*  But the distribution of equities across households, the top 10% of Americans own 88% of equities. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1753.3799999999999s)]
*  88% of the stock market. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1762.4199999999998s)]
*  The next 40% owns 12% of the stock market. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1764.26s)]
*  The bottom 50% has debt. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1768.82s)]
*  They have credit card bills. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1772.1799999999998s)]
*  They rent their homes. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1773.86s)]
*  They have auto loans. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1775.1399999999999s)]
*  And we've got to give them some relief. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1776.6599999999999s)]
*  I was struck by the statistic from last year. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1780.4199999999998s)]
*  That's the message right there. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1783.3s)]
*  Just as a bystander, I'm like, wow, OK. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1784.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1786.1799999999998s)]
*  Or that I like the examples. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1786.6599999999999s)]
*  And I was really struck by two different statistics last year. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1791.7s)]
*  Summer of 2024, Americans took more European vacations than they had in history. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1796.26s)]
*  Summer of 2024, more Americans were using food banks than they ever have in history. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1803.54s)]
*  I went into two food banks near my hometown to ask, what's the story? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1810.26s)]
*  And they said, you know, it really takes, for a lot of people, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1816.82s)]
*  it's a loss of dignity to walk in a food bank. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1822.1s)]
*  Of course. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1824.1s)]
*  But they were seeing something, a new phenomenon, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1825.7s)]
*  that it wasn't their traditional clientele. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1828.42s)]
*  It wasn't people who'd lost their homes. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1830.82s)]
*  It wasn't people out on the street. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1832.34s)]
*  These were working families who could no longer, you know, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1834.98s)]
*  $100 at the grocery store, that basket of groceries every week, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1839.14s)]
*  they were missing five, six, seven things, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1844.26s)]
*  and they were coming to the food bank to top up. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1846.98s)]
*  So that's not a great America. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1849.54s)]
*  Record European vacation, record food banks. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1852.26s)]
*  And no reason we can't keep the record European vacations going, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1855.38s)]
*  but we got to take care of these other people. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1859.8600000000001s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1864.18s)]
*  That they don't want handouts. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1866.18s)]
*  The Democrats had this strategy called Compensate the Loser. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1869.06s)]
*  So first of all, the name of that strategy, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1873.54s)]
*  I don't think the bottom 50% of Americans are losers. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1876.1000000000001s)]
*  I think the system hasn't worked for them. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1879.46s)]
*  I think that they are winners. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1884.02s)]
*  It's just a bad system. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1886.1s)]
*  So we are going to fix the system. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1887.8600000000001s)]
*  And look, they want good jobs. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1890.98s)]
*  They want their kids to do better than they did. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1893.6200000000001s)]
*  They want to own a home. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1895.78s)]
*  They want to pay down their debt. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1897.22s)]
*  That this isn't hard. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1899.06s)]
*  And I think that we can do this in the next four years. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1901.7s)]
*  It used to be only crazy people thought they were being watched all the time, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1906.9s)]
*  surveilled the guy mumbling next to you on the bus. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1912.1000000000001s)]
*  But now anyone who knows what's going on thinks that because it's true. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1914.5s)]
*  Your phones are listening to you. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1918.1000000000001s)]
*  Tech companies tracking all your online activity [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1919.7s)]
*  in order to profit off of what ought to be private information. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1922.5s)]
*  Governments are watching too. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1925.8600000000001s)]
*  It's a corrupt system. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1927.5400000000002s)]
*  It's frightening. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1928.5s)]
*  And the worst part is it's all legal. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1929.0600000000002s)]
*  Government certainly will not help stop this. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1930.98s)]
*  Of course, the intelligences love it. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1932.98s)]
*  So it's up to you to protect yourself. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1935.3000000000002s)]
*  And that's where ExpressVPN comes in. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1936.9s)]
*  ExpressVPN, which we use here, is an app that sends 100% [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1939.0600000000002s)]
*  of your online activity through secure encrypted servers. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1942.66s)]
*  That means nobody can see what you do online. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1945.3000000000002s)]
*  Not internet service providers, not data brokers, not intel agencies. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1948.02s)]
*  Don't believe it? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1953.3000000000002s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1954.18s)]
*  Within the last year, ExpressVPN received over 400,000 data requests [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1954.66s)]
*  from tech companies and government agencies, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1960.26s)]
*  but did not share a single piece of cuff trimmer data. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1962.42s)]
*  That's because the company has a strict zero logs policy. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1965.7s)]
*  ExpressVPN cannot and will not share your data. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1969.94s)]
*  They don't even have your data to share. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1973.22s)]
*  ExpressVPN is easy to use. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1975.78s)]
*  Takes one click. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=1977.06s)]

*  when you ever had dinner with people, were like, wow, you know, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2005.06s)]

*  wow, you know, I just tried to drive somewhere for 100 miles. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2014.18s)]
*  This country doesn't look good. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2017.46s)]

*  So when I was born first, six, seven, eight years, we were affluent. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2051.62s)]
*  He lost everything. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2056.98s)]
*  And so I've seen what that's like. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2059.06s)]
*  I've seen both sides that I was fortunate enough to be able to make it back. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2062.34s)]
*  And that, you know, I know what economic insecurity is like. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2067.3s)]
*  And I don't think people should have to have that or if you want to work hard. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2075.46s)]
*  And people want to work hard. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2080.42s)]
*  You were out on the campaign trail of President Trump. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2082.1800000000003s)]
*  I was out on the campaign trail. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2084.9s)]
*  And I got to say, one of the most so I went for the final two stops in Pittsburgh, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2086.6600000000003s)]
*  Grand Rapids, Michigan, Pittsburgh in the Duquesne Arena walk in. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2097.06s)]
*  And there are the union workers, the steel workers. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2102.26s)]
*  They got in their hats. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2106.34s)]
*  They got in their vests. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2107.3s)]
*  They're with their children. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2108.26s)]
*  And it's very moving. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2110.1s)]
*  They just want a better life. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2113.2200000000003s)]
*  They want their communities to be sound. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2114.7400000000002s)]
*  They want their kids to do better. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2117.78s)]
*  They want a little league baseball. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2119.86s)]
*  They don't care what's going on in Madison Avenue. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2123.6200000000003s)]
*  They don't know what the hot new restaurant is in Paris. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2126.5s)]
*  And that President Trump somehow has assembled this incredible coalition [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2129.54s)]
*  of Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2134.9s)]
*  And those folks who were in the Rose Garden yesterday and those people I saw at the Duquesne Arena. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2137.86s)]
*  And I think it's unbelievable. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2142.98s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2146.6600000000003s)]
*  What do you worry about as Treasury Secretary? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2149.3s)]
*  Obviously, probably like lying bed at night, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2151.54s)]
*  thinking about all the things go wrong with the US economy. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2153.78s)]
*  What are your, if you could be honest, what are your biggest worries? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2155.86s)]
*  That so to the extent that in my business career, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2160.6600000000003s)]
*  I had a strong point. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2165.46s)]
*  I think it was risk management. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2166.42s)]
*  So I do myself two things. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2168.2599999999998s)]
*  So the United States leading bond salesman. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2170.58s)]
*  And I think that with what's going on, I'm going to have a better and better story to tell [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2173.7s)]
*  as we're getting our economic health and our fiscal house in order. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2178.58s)]
*  And then I try to imagine what could go very wrong. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2183.7799999999997s)]
*  What would we do if there were another outbreak somewhere to COVID? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2189.94s)]
*  You can't worry about things like that. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2195.62s)]
*  But I worry about a kinetic war somewhere. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2198.34s)]
*  What would we do in the event of something that happened? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2205.06s)]
*  And what I try to do is create the situation where I can worry a little less every day. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2211.38s)]
*  So I'll tell you, I came in, I was confirmed on January 28th. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2218.1s)]
*  And during the month of January, 10 year interest rates, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2223.7799999999997s)]
*  which is probably the most important rate in the country, mortgages are based on that. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2228.02s)]
*  Business and capital formation is based on that. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2233.7799999999997s)]
*  I came in and that it almost spiked to 5%. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2236.9s)]
*  And I think 5% can be an uncomfortable area for the economy, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2240.02s)]
*  for treasury who has to issue a lot of bonds. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2245.22s)]
*  And now that I've gotten in, I worry a little less, but I still worry. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2248.74s)]
*  We've got a tremendous amount of debt to roll. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2256.2599999999998s)]
*  And I worry that we aren't going to do the smart cuts and the focus on waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2259.9399999999996s)]
*  I worry that that gets sidelined. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2270.74s)]
*  And then on the other side, I worry that the tax bill somehow gets bogged down. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2273.1400000000003s)]
*  We could have the largest tax increase in history. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2279.6200000000003s)]
*  Or I worry that the normal geopolitical things, whether it's Iran, Taiwan, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2282.98s)]
*  that something goes haywire between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2292.5s)]
*  So you began your job description by saying you're a bond salesman. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2298.34s)]
*  You're selling America's debt to the world. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2302.34s)]
*  And I know that was like a big part of the portfolio as the transition was envisioning it, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2304.42s)]
*  who can make the case for American bonds to the world? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2308.98s)]
*  Are you confident you can do that? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2315.3s)]
*  And how is your pitch changing after yesterday? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2316.98s)]
*  Well, as I said, right now we're in this strange betwixt and between because [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2321.78s)]
*  we are going to take in substantial tariff revenue. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2328.82s)]
*  And what DOGE is doing is substantially cutting expenses, but we're not getting [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2332.02s)]
*  credit for it right now. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2338.26s)]
*  But I think market's starting to get a hint of it. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2339.54s)]
*  So the 10 year bond having almost peaked at five is now through four. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2344.02s)]
*  Way to think about it is every hundred, every basis points about a billion dollars in savings. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2353.14s)]
*  So we've saved a hundred billion dollars. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2359.46s)]
*  And that's probably not going to happen that quickly again. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2363.3s)]
*  But I think that we are setting the sales for a much better fiscal time. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2369.86s)]
*  And people don't have to say the U.S. is out of control. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2378.66s)]
*  The U.S. is going to default. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2382.9s)]
*  But we're not. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2386.66s)]
*  And I think every day my case gets better. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2388.18s)]
*  And if we were to just imagine a very reductionist formula for government. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2394.1s)]
*  So G equals S minus T, spending minus taxes. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2400.02s)]
*  That for spending, our side, the Republicans, we like to spend, but less than the Democrats, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2405.7799999999997s)]
*  but both sides like to spend. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2415.3s)]
*  And then minus T, Democrats like higher taxes. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2417.06s)]
*  We like lower taxes. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2420.66s)]
*  What if the S actually went down? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2422.66s)]
*  And I think to me, that's the exciting part. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2426.18s)]
*  That that's been unthinkable in everybody's calculation. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2429.22s)]
*  No one's even really seriously raised it, including Ronald Reagan, by the way. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2432.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2436.5s)]
*  And look, I think President Reagan had a different agenda that he ramped up defense spending. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2437.62s)]
*  And remember, oh, he's crazy. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2445.14s)]
*  It's this is going to break the budget. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2446.82s)]
*  Star Wars is crazy. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2449.06s)]
*  He's a mad man. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2450.98s)]
*  And then the Iron Curtain went down. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2452.42s)]
*  Yes, we were able to. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2454.18s)]
*  So it's actually a Soviet term. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2455.78s)]
*  And he used the Soviet strategy on this on themselves, on the Russians escalate to de-escalate. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2459.22s)]
*  So we escalated military spending. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2465.94s)]
*  They tried to keep up and then they collapsed. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2468.26s)]
*  So again, everything's easy in hindsight. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2472.34s)]
*  But I think here what we're doing in terms of bringing down these credible levels of spending, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2477.7s)]
*  but more importantly, I tell anyone who listen, I said, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2484.66s)]
*  remember, Doge is the office of government efficiency, not elimination, not extinction. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2489.54s)]
*  So what if we can actually do a better job with less? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2497.7s)]
*  Seems inconceivable. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2504.5s)]
*  But when I see what's going on in a lot of these government agencies, it's unbelievable. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2505.7799999999997s)]
*  And if you think I've lived in Manhattan, I've lived in Florida, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2511.8599999999997s)]
*  roughly state of New York, state of Florida, have the same number of people. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2518.74s)]
*  Actually, Florida has a few more now. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2523.06s)]
*  So New York budget is about $235 billion. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2526.3399999999997s)]
*  Florida budget is $125 billion. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2531.7000000000003s)]
*  How do they do that? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2533.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2535.06s)]
*  And there's no income tax in Florida. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2536.1s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2538.5s)]
*  And the roads are better. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2539.06s)]
*  And you go and get your driver's license and it takes 15 minutes, not five hours. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2540.7400000000002s)]
*  So I think, can we make the rest of America look more like Florida and less like New York? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2546.7400000000002s)]
*  Or one day is New York going to look more like Florida? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2553.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2557.14s)]
*  So do you think after four years, we will see an actual net reduction in government spending, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2558.66s)]
*  thanks to Doge? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2563.06s)]
*  Inflation adjusted, yes. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2564.42s)]
*  How long do you think Elon's in for? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2568.7400000000002s)]
*  I think that Elon, that day to day, I don't know. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2571.06s)]
*  But I think his imprint is going to be with us a long time. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2576.58s)]
*  And I think that the mainstream media has tried to demonize Doge and all the folks who work with him. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2580.5s)]
*  And I think we have a couple of Treasury, a couple of IRS, they're Treasury employees who I hired, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2592.58s)]
*  I interviewed. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2600.6600000000003s)]
*  And I'll tell you, there's this one fellow, Tom Krause. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2602.02s)]
*  He was on TV with Bret Baier the other night. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2605.38s)]
*  And Tom's incredible. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2608.26s)]
*  He's done $100 billion of tech mergers. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2609.78s)]
*  With my investment business, I would have hired him. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2612.82s)]
*  I don't think I could have afforded him. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2615.5400000000004s)]
*  And he is doing this for the good of his country. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2617.38s)]
*  He came in without touching any of the payment systems, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2620.9s)]
*  that the mistruths that were spread by the Washington Post, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2625.0600000000004s)]
*  he has analyzed the system. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2631.38s)]
*  And within six weeks, pointed at all the vulnerabilities. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2633.3s)]
*  There's a young man named Sam Kyrgos, who was on Laura Ingraham with me the other night. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2637.46s)]
*  And that was my idea. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2644.1000000000004s)]
*  It's like, let's bring him out of the shadows. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2645.3s)]
*  And let's make this demonization stop. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2648.7400000000002s)]
*  And like this young man, other than the fact he only owns one pair of pants, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2653.46s)]
*  which he likes telling everyone, you or I would be happy if our daughter brought him home. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2657.46s)]
*  He's a patriot. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2663.3s)]
*  He's working hard for the country. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2664.98s)]
*  And he's analytical. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2667.06s)]
*  And the things that he's seen at the IRS, just in their tech systems, that's all he does. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2669.14s)]
*  Elon has a shirt that he wears under his jacket. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2675.46s)]
*  He'll flash it every once in a while. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2678.18s)]
*  It says tech support. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2679.62s)]
*  And that's what we're getting, is we've got a blockbuster style government. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2681.46s)]
*  And we should be on Netflix. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2687.62s)]
*  We're hailing cabs. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2691.38s)]
*  And we're in an Uber economy. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2692.9s)]
*  Why can't the government be in the gig economy? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2694.82s)]
*  Not hard. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2697.94s)]
*  So we're not positive that cryptocurrency is the future of finance, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2699.06s)]
*  but we do know that what we have now is broken and dangerous. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2702.02s)]
*  Debt has never been higher in this country. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2705.6200000000003s)]
*  Many of our so-called leaders are getting rich, serving you. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2707.38s)]
*  It's a scam. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2710.82s)]
*  So where does it go? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2712.1000000000004s)]
*  Well, thankfully, there are options. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2712.9s)]
*  Donald Trump has said repeatedly he wants the United States to be the crypto capital of the world. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2715.1400000000003s)]
*  He's already created the Crypto Advisory Council and recently signed an executive order [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2719.3s)]
*  to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2723.22s)]
*  This could give normal people an alternative to the government's failing system, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2725.8599999999997s)]
*  and frankly, to the US dollar. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2730.18s)]
*  I'm not saying put all your money outside the US dollar, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2731.62s)]
*  but like don't be crazy. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2734.18s)]
*  Don't be stupid here. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2735.22s)]
*  You can see where it's going. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2736.02s)]
*  So the people at iTrust Capital can help you get in to this. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2737.3799999999997s)]

*  They make it easy. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2744.02s)]
*  They're based 100% in the United States of America. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2745.06s)]
*  We looked into this. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2747.3799999999997s)]
*  They service only American investors, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2748.5s)]
*  and they operate the only platform that allows you to buy and sell crypto [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2750.9s)]
*  24-7 both inside and outside of your tax-advantaged IRA. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2754.5s)]
*  And it all happens on one easy-to-use dashboard. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2758.1800000000003s)]
*  They also operate a closed loop system, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2761.14s)]
*  meaning that bad actors can't access your account and steal your money. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2763.62s)]
*  So if you're considering adding Bitcoin if you want to, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2767.62s)]
*  or some other cryptocurrency portfolio, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2770.02s)]
*  iTrust can be trusted, and it's easy to understand. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2772.98s)]
*  iTrustCapital.com or click the link below. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2776.98s)]
*  Can I ask you a weird question? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2780.5s)]
*  Who runs the Federal Reserve exactly? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2782.5800000000004s)]
*  How can you have this pivotal entity, institution, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2786.02s)]
*  that obviously has the most direct effect on markets? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2790.9s)]
*  And it does seem outside of political control. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2796.1000000000004s)]
*  What is that? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2799.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, look, I think that during my confirmation hearing, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2800.66s)]
*  and I was actually at a dinner that Jerome Powell was at last night, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2808.4199999999996s)]
*  at my confirmation hearing, I said, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2815.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm only going to talk about the mistakes the Federal Reserve has made in the past. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2818.74s)]
*  I won't talk about the ones they're going to make in the future. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2823.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2826.3399999999997s)]
*  But I think it is important for monetary policy that they are walled off, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2827.54s)]
*  that some of the other things they do, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2833.46s)]
*  regulation, they got into DEI, they got into climate. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2836.02s)]
*  I actually think that that impinges on their monetary policy and makes them vulnerable. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2839.7799999999997s)]
*  So I think that they should focus on monetary policy [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2848.1s)]
*  doing the best that they can for the American economy, the American people, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2852.9s)]
*  keeping inflation low. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2857.2200000000003s)]
*  And then the rest, there are a lot of other banking agencies too. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2859.86s)]
*  So the Fed controls the weather now too? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2867.86s)]
*  What were they doing with climate? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2869.78s)]
*  Well, I will tell you, there's something, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2871.7000000000003s)]
*  the Treasury Secretary chairs something called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2874.02s)]
*  and it's all the financial regulators. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2879.7s)]
*  And I think it was two weeks before Silicon Valley Bank went under, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2883.3799999999997s)]
*  FSOC issued a report. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2889.54s)]
*  And guess what they said the biggest risk to the financial system was? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2892.58s)]
*  Climate. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2896.2599999999998s)]
*  Really. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2897.9399999999996s)]
*  Not that there was a large bank in California that was having a slow motion run on its assets [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2898.98s)]
*  and that it would cause another bank failure than another bank failure was climate. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2905.06s)]
*  So as far as I can see, climate's been pretty good. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2911.94s)]
*  They failed. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2917.38s)]
*  The regulators failed. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2918.42s)]
*  And I think that's what people are getting sick of. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2920.5s)]
*  And it's back to one of my favorite phrases that President Trump uses, common sense. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2923.62s)]
*  It's just common sense. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2930.42s)]
*  That if you have a whole bunch of deposit that could leave your bank with a click, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2931.94s)]
*  you shouldn't have all these long-term assets, but they were too busy worrying about the weather. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2938.66s)]
*  And there was also some degree of regulatory capture. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2944.98s)]
*  Seems hard to believe to the average citizen. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2948.98s)]
*  The CEO of Silicon Valley Bank was on the board of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2952.82s)]
*  who was his chief regulator. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2958.98s)]
*  They're going to tell that guy what to do. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2962.1s)]
*  Why is gold moving around the world in such huge quantities right now? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2965.38s)]
*  Well, a couple of things. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2969.06s)]
*  It's moving. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2971.46s)]
*  Physically, it's moving because of potential tariffs here. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2974.7400000000002s)]
*  So it was unclear whether we were going to exempt gold from tariffs, which I believe we have. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2978.66s)]
*  So there was a big move out of vaults in Switzerland, out of vaults in London, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2987.94s)]
*  to get it into New York. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2992.42s)]
*  And look, there are a lot of different stores of value over time. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=2995.94s)]
*  Bitcoin's becoming a store of value. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3002.26s)]
*  Gold has historically been a store of value. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3004.42s)]
*  I think what's interesting is where do we see the gold demand coming from? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3009.2200000000003s)]
*  Huge amount is from China. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3014.02s)]
*  Where, as I said, they're in the middle of an economic recession slash depression. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3016.02s)]
*  People don't trust the Chinese currency because they have capital controls. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3022.02s)]
*  There are 1.4 billion Chinese who won't want to get their money out, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3027.06s)]
*  and they won't let them. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3033.7000000000003s)]
*  They will let them buy gold. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3034.82s)]
*  So that's the response you think. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3039.06s)]
*  Do you find it interesting that even now, 2025, when everything is abstract and digital, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3041.2999999999997s)]
*  that gold is still widely believed globally to be a reliable store of value? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3046.34s)]
*  I think that gold has a lot of history going with it. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3052.98s)]
*  That a friend of mine's grandmother, Russia, had a financial crisis in 98. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3060.98s)]
*  Then they had a big inflation. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3066.98s)]
*  A friend of mine's grandmother went out and bought 18 bicycles [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3068.8199999999997s)]
*  and put them in her apartment, and that was her store of value. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3071.94s)]
*  How did she do on the bike investment? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3075.62s)]
*  Great. I wish I did that well. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3077.3799999999997s)]
*  Gold also has other applications, a lot of applications, jewelry in India, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3086.02s)]
*  but it's something that historically people have all agreed on. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3091.2999999999997s)]
*  And gold can't have a fiscal problem. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3095.54s)]
*  Gold cannot have a gigantic budget deficit. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3100.82s)]
*  Gold cannot have a war. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3105.0600000000004s)]
*  So just the fact that it is this isolated thing makes it very interesting. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3112.42s)]
*  The fact that the entire global trading system, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3119.06s)]
*  until Richard Nixon took us off, was tied to gold. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3124.02s)]
*  So you're not anti-gold? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3127.46s)]
*  Oh, no. No, no, no. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3129.38s)]
*  When I had my fund, I think people might have called me a gold bug. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3131.78s)]
*  How did you wind up interacting with Zelensky? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3136.1800000000003s)]
*  The president asked me to go to Kiev. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3138.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, he actually asked me to lead the economic agreement that was part of his peace plan. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3143.62s)]
*  And I think it's important to look at the arc of President Trump's peace plan. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3152.8199999999997s)]
*  And he had sequenced it really well. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3160.58s)]
*  We're going to sign a deal with Ukrainians, and it'll do several things. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3164.1s)]
*  One, it will make the U.S. and Ukraine partners, link us closer together. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3171.38s)]
*  Two, it will be a symbol to Russian leadership that the U.S. isn't abandoning Ukraine. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3180.98s)]
*  But importantly, three, it will show the American people that we have an economic stake [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3188.7400000000002s)]
*  and that we haven't just been doing these massive grants, which has been the history of USAID. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3195.38s)]
*  Of course. So Ukraine succeeds, we succeed, and it could be a long-term partnership. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3201.5400000000004s)]
*  Now, President, I thought it was important to take the agreement to Kiev and present it [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3208.9s)]
*  to President Zelensky. Everyone was telling me, oh no, having me to in Vienna, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3215.46s)]
*  he's going to be at the Munich Security Conference a few days later. I said, no, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3220.1s)]
*  I want to go there and discuss it with him. And that's how I ended up going to Kiev. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3225.7s)]
*  Very interesting going to Kiev, fly to Poland. Then you get on, I don't know if you've been on [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3231.78s)]
*  it, get on this night train for 10 hours. And you arrive at Kiev at 830 in the morning. And for [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3236.42s)]
*  anyone who they said, oh, the President Trump selling out to the Russians, not selling out to [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3244.5s)]
*  the Russians, the Russians bombed Kiev four hours before I got there. They hadn't bombed since [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3251.78s)]
*  November. So the Russians didn't like the look of this deal, because it thought that the it was [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3258.66s)]
*  actually something durable for the U.S. people and the Ukrainian people. So what happened? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3264.5s)]
*  President Zelensky was in the mood to sign the deal that day. We had a spirited discussion. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3270.98s)]
*  And I said to him, you've got 50 reporters out there. I am here to show that there is no daylight [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3278.98s)]
*  between the American people, the Russian people, between Ukrainian people, between the [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3287.38s)]
*  the American leadership and Ukrainian leadership. I said, you've opened up [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3294.66s)]
*  daylight sides of the Grand Canyon. What are we going to go out and tell those people? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3302.42s)]
*  I said, tell them I'm going to sign the deal in Munich. I said, so you're going to sign the deal [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3305.94s)]
*  when you see Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Rubio in Munich? Yes. He didn't sign it there. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3312.02s)]
*  There's a lot of back and forth the following week. They're begging to come to the White House [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3318.9s)]
*  and should make him sign the deal before he comes. And then he got to the Oval Office and blew up [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3325.7000000000003s)]
*  what should have been the easiest thing to do in the world. He was supposed to show up, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3333.46s)]
*  have a press conference. We're going to have a private lunch. If he had anything on his mind, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3337.62s)]
*  there were going to be nine of us, nine of them in the White House dining room. He could have aired [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3342.6600000000003s)]
*  his grievances then. And there's a famous photo in the East Wing ballroom of everything laid out [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3347.38s)]
*  on the table to be signed. And it never got signed. So this is an unelected president of a client state [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3356.7400000000002s)]
*  whose bureaucrats are being paid directly by American taxpayers, including their retirement [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3364.02s)]
*  accounts are funded by us. And they have the lowest retirement age in Europe. It's 60. Put it in contrast, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3368.42s)]
*  France is 62 and Italy 67. And we're paying for that. And so at a certain point, you wouldn't [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3374.82s)]
*  expect a man like that in a highly precarious position, I think it's fair to say, to assume a [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3382.7400000000002s)]
*  high handed tone with American officials and berate them and sniff a lot and say, he's basically [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3390.1800000000003s)]
*  acting like a crazy person. How do you account for that? The arrogance? What is that? Look, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3396.98s)]
*  a couple of things is he was a performer, kind of a vaudevillian. And he was an ordinary person [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3401.62s)]
*  thrown into a fraud time, rose to the occasion, was heroic, and I think is stuck. And I think [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3411.2200000000003s)]
*  under a tremendous amount of pressure, I think that some of the government officials around him [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3422.34s)]
*  and the cabinet are very good. I think some of the people around him, he's not getting the best [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3429.06s)]
*  advice, that his advisors are not perfect. And I think if we go back to the agreement, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3434.98s)]
*  I think one of the great things about the agreement is it makes sure that the money comes to the [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3444.1s)]
*  American people and the Ukrainian people. Because Tucker, let me tell you what the agreement wasn't. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3449.2999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't one of these rapacious Chinese deals where it's sign over your mind, sign over your [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3454.5s)]
*  port, or it wasn't a loan to own. Here's the loan, you're never going to be able to pay it back, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3460.42s)]
*  we're going to get this. It's a genuine economic partnership that they put in assets, we can put [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3465.94s)]
*  in loans from our overseas banks, we put in American know how, and we don't make any money [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3473.54s)]
*  unless they make money. And you know who doesn't like that? People with their hand in the till. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3479.86s)]
*  Because we were regulating the flow of the money. So I think that's part of the glitch. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3486.42s)]
*  I am hopeful that it was a bug, not a feature of the system, and that that's been fixed. We're [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3494.26s)]
*  expecting a Ukrainian technical team beginning of next week, and I'm hopeful we can get this [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3504.82s)]
*  thing signed and go back to a win-win situation. Because President Trump, I didn't give you the [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3512.02s)]
*  full arc of the deal, President Trump wanted to create this deal with the Ukrainians, then be able [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3520.26s)]
*  to go to Russian leadership and show them that we do stand with the Ukrainians, but on an economic [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3527.38s)]
*  basis. And then the Russians would be incentivized to come to the table also. And so that the [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3538.02s)]
*  sequencing has been thrown off, but I think we can fix it. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3547.46s)]
*  Are we ever going to get an audit of where all of our billions went? Where all the weapons we sent, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3554.5s)]
*  what happened to all the cash, all the pallets of hundred dollar bills, like where are they now? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3560.3399999999997s)]
*  Why is it hard to get an audit of what happened to the money? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3565.54s)]
*  I don't know. Tucker, in my life, I always try to look forward. And I think if this deal works, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3569.22s)]
*  then that money could end up being small change. A good way to think about it, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3576.3399999999997s)]
*  when the Iron Curtain came down, Ukraine and Poland's economies were roughly the same size. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3583.7799999999997s)]
*  Poland is three and a half or four times larger now. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3590.98s)]
*  Poland is going to have one of the highest per capita GDPs in the world, higher than some [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3594.8199999999997s)]
*  Western European countries. For sure. Ukraine, to your point, because of various kleptocracy [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3600.02s)]
*  aspects, has been held back. So hopefully, with US assistance and President Trump engineering this [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3607.78s)]
*  peace deal, Ukrainian people can have a better future. For a Treasury Secretary, you're a very [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3618.98s)]
*  capable diplomat, I must say, very diplomatic language. Last question, how do you, so because [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3624.82s)]
*  this is also news going back to the tariff announcement yesterday, and because it's like, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3630.82s)]
*  it really is a total departure from what all of us have grown up with and our expectations and [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3635.38s)]
*  however much you support it, it's new. And people are freaked out about it. How do you keep message [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3640.26s)]
*  discipline in an administration, in any administration, and this one specifically, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3647.06s)]
*  how do you decide how you're going to explain this, who's going to explain it? How do you keep [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3651.46s)]
*  messages from contradicting one another? What is that process like? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3657.46s)]
*  We all take President Trump's lead. We know we had a meeting yesterday morning, we had a meeting [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3660.58s)]
*  after the announcement in the Rose Garden before we went out doing media. And as you know, he's his [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3668.18s)]
*  own best spokesman. Nobody can do it better. And then we fan out, and we are all unified behind [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3675.46s)]
*  this and his vision. That's why we're here. If you didn't want to be part of it, shouldn't be here. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3685.06s)]
*  But you ever say like, you know, maybe this is someone who can reassure potential bond buyers, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3690.58s)]
*  investors in markets, this person scares the crap out of markets, like, let's get the guy [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3697.46s)]
*  who reassures markets. Well, the one thing I will say that no one should listen to anyone in the [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3702.5s)]
*  markets talk about the US dollar, other than President Trump or myself. We're the only ones [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3710.1s)]
*  who speak for this administration, the United States government on dollar policy. I can tell [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3715.46s)]
*  you, we have a strong dollar policy, and we're putting in all of the necessary ingredients [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3721.54s)]
*  to make sure the dollar is strong over the long run. Can it go up and down on a Bloomberg terminal [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3729.3s)]
*  over the short run? Sure. Can individual bilateral moves happen between the dollar and the Mexican [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3735.94s)]
*  currency, the dollar and the yen? Sure, that's what I made my living doing. I'm glad it doesn't. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3743.7s)]
*  But over time, if we put in solid economic fundamentals, and do this transformative program, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3749.3799999999997s)]
*  then the dollar is going to do great. And the American people are going to do great. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3758.3399999999997s)]
*  Secretary, thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3763.22s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising. That's [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3765.86s)]
*  what they do. But on another level, it's shocking. With everything that's going on in the world right [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3775.46s)]
*  now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, one the cusp of [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3779.46s)]
*  fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information rather than more. And that [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3784.7400000000002s)]
*  is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. That's [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3790.9s)]
*  a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it, a way that you [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3797.06s)]
*  could actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. The way to do that on [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3801.2200000000003s)]
*  YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe. Hit the little bell icon to be notified [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3806.7400000000002s)]
*  when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3811.94s)]
*  actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnX1SQfgJI&t=3817.62s)]
