# Don Trump Jr. on the Growing Threats to His Father’s Life, and Plan to Uproot Political Corruption
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU)
*  One of our plans when we started TCN was to run great long-form content, documentaries and topics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=0.0s)]
*  that other people were ignoring. Well, we have the best so far. It's called Wine in the Sand, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=5.68s)]
*  and it's by James O'Keefe, one of the last brave and honest journalists in this country. How brave? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=11.84s)]
*  James O'Keefe embedded with the cartels as they moved migrants engaged in human trafficking at [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=17.6s)]
*  the largest scale in modern times from Latin America to the United States. He embedded with [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  the cartels with hidden cameras and the result is this documentary Wine in the Sand, which we [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=29.04s)]
*  are proud to run exclusively on TCN. Wine in the Sand October 10th, highly recommended. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=34.48s)]
*  What's going on everyone? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=44.08s)]
*  You are so nice to do this. Oh, it's my pleasure. I asked him backstage, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  how many nights have you been home in the last month? He's like, I'm home? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=52.08s)]
*  Oh, and like Lexi called me, it was like, I guess yesterday morning. They're like, they weren't sure [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=55.84s)]
*  if Russell or John were able to make it to the show in Fort Lauderdale. And I live a couple hours [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=59.92s)]
*  north of there. Can you do it? I'm like, of course I'll do that for Tucker. They're like, well, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=64.56s)]
*  they're able to make it now. So can you come in as like a fourth person? I'm like, can I have one [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  night with my children, please? For the love of God, it's been 30 days. So I'm out out gracefully. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=73.68s)]
*  You're the only non-Mormon man I know who has more children than I do. And I say that with envy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, you got to do what you love. I was listening to your intro. I have five kids. I know how that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  happens now. So I took up something much less vicious like politics. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=90.88s)]
*  So where are we? I just touted you as someone who has his finger in the pulse. And I happen to know [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=95.92s)]
*  for a fact that that's true. That was not a sales job. Where are we, do you think, in this race? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=100.72s)]
*  Honestly, we're in a place and you know, I'm a guy that this is my third time around. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=106.64s)]
*  We're in a place that's better than we've ever been in a comparable position. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=111.36s)]
*  Wow. You know, and as you know, I am the guy that's sort of willing to go into the ground and go [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=117.68s)]
*  into the parts of forgotten America. And those are sort of my friends, despite where, you know, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=123.44s)]
*  sort of I grew up and I appreciate and understand the irony of it, but it's sort of the way I was [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=128.16s)]
*  always just brought up. And, you know, in 16, it was like, you still believe the media narrative. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  It's like, we're supposed to lose. I was like, but we're going to overperform, but we'll probably [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  lose. In 20, I was like, man, it's actually significantly better. And just as like in October [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=144.0s)]
*  of 2020, I did 104 like rallies myself. So like, you know, four a day for 30 days, like it was, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=149.92s)]
*  but you see, but you do get a pulse and you see it. It's like, we're going to do better. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  And of course we did, but, you know, yeah, I know. Yeah. This time around, like they got over a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  billion votes. I think that year, the real problem is if they showed up with a billion votes on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=168.4s)]
*  November 6th, they would tell us it was the freest and most fair election ever. They would present [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=174.8s)]
*  no evidence of that. They would say it. And if you don't believe that you're racist or you're an [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=179.44s)]
*  insurrectionist or some other thing that you're obviously not, they can give you something that's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=184.88s)]
*  statistically impossible and they'll jam it down your throats. And what's really good about this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=189.36s)]
*  cycle is people get it. They're sick of it, but more importantly, so many are now finally [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=194.32s)]
*  emerging as unafraid to say it. Right. If people get unafraid, if they start talking about the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=203.44s)]
*  realities of it, if, you know, before it was like, oh, you're canceled, you know, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=212.4s)]
*  notice how like things that would have gotten you canceled two, three years ago, people are saying [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=216.24s)]
*  out in open. I mean, they're not even canceling you on social media for saying some of these things. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  They're still censoring the hell out of you, but it's just different. So the atmosphere is so good. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=223.44s)]
*  It feels so strong. Unlike anything I've experienced so far. Really? Even compared to 2020? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=230.72s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, now even compared to like closer to the election, because I mean, I've been, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=236.8s)]
*  you know, on the road now for weeks. You know, even in June, I was like, wow, I mean, people [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=241.52s)]
*  have had enough. They're sick of being lied to. They're sick of being told, no, no, Bidenomics is [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=246.56s)]
*  working for you. And I know it for myself because listen, I've been blessed. I know that I don't [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=252.48s)]
*  pretend to be otherwise, but I think I told you the story one time we were hanging out and I was [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=257.36s)]
*  like, I was coming back from a fishing trip with my son. He was 10 and 14 at the time, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  two, like last year. And we went to McDonald's and it was my 10 year old, my 14 year old and me, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=264.88s)]
*  and it was $48. And I was like, holy crap. Like if Donald Trump Jr. has sticker shock, folks, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=271.12s)]
*  like, I don't know. That seems ridiculous. Like if I am pissed off, what does you get? Do you mind [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=278.4s)]
*  if I ask? You know, I don't even remember. It didn't matter. It was just, it wasn't like excessive. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  But if I'm sitting there, be like, I don't get it. You know, I'm not, and again, I'm not like you see [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=292.96s)]
*  it on the Sunday shows, you know, some liberal, my three week old baby was recently crying about [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=297.52s)]
*  nuclear proliferation on the Korean peninsula. Like they're virtue signaling. I'm not pretending [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  it's going to change my habits or I'm lucky enough that it doesn't have to, it doesn't affect me, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=308.08s)]
*  but I know it affects some family that's making $50,000 a year, $60,000 a year. If I'm pissed off, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  they're livid and they've had enough of being told you just have to accept it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  It's going to be good while we send another 250 billion to Ukraine to fight a war that no one [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=325.68s)]
*  has articulated to me or you. I do this now. You know, I don't really make any money in politics, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=330.72s)]
*  but like I'm sort of just like, I'm a fighter. I'm like, I'm in the game now. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=342.88000000000005s)]
*  No one's are taking that. We must do this. I go, but why, what does victory look like? Well, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=347.6s)]
*  we don't really know. Well, so does it stop at a trillion dollars? 10 trillion. When the interest [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  on our debt is now a trillion dollars a year, just the interest on the money that we borrow so we can [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=357.84s)]
*  send Pakistan $25 million to fund transgender programs in their schools. It's like, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=362.96s)]
*  see what I mean? Everyone knows it. Like everyone is sick of it. It has to stop. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, can I ask you a question? So you, you do travel and speak to audiences [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=375.12s)]
*  more than anybody. I'm more than anybody actually that I'm aware of. And you always have in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=380.88s)]
*  Washington where I spent my whole life until recently. I don't think there are four Republicans [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=386.32s)]
*  in the house who've asked the questions about Ukraine than you have. Do you ever meet an [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=391.92s)]
*  audience that is like, no, we really need to keep going funding this war in Ukraine. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=397.12s)]
*  So I do this in a lot of the speeches. I'll do it right here because I haven't done it in a while. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=402.08s)]
*  You know, and I've had two responses. And so let's say over the last year, I've spoken to 50, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=406.56s)]
*  60,000 people probably, right? You know, opening up for DJT, a rally, a group of 300 people here, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=411.52s)]
*  that may be 10,000, 5,000. This is 10,000, whatever it is. And I do it, you know, show of hands, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=416.48s)]
*  raise your hand if Ukraine is a top 10 priority for you in your life, top 10. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=425.28s)]
*  And I'll do it. If it is, I'll give you the mic. How about a top three? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=432.4s)]
*  It doesn't exist. I found two people, two people of now let's call it 65,000 people that I speak [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=436.72s)]
*  to weekly. That was, it was not top three, but it was top 10. First guy, sir. Why? I am from Kiev, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine. I was like, okay, fine. I'm going to give you a pass. And the other was a guy that's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  like a Beltway warmonger. I was like, so you're on the board of Ray Theon or something like that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, no, not exactly. I was like Northrop Grumman walks away, you know, and I, and yet I get the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  calls by the way, what's nice about me, I'm not a politician. I'll call it both sides. I get the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  calls from Republicans. Hey, Don, can you not go so tough on the Ukraine? Because, you know, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  some of that money is getting funneled back to like, you know, a missile maker. And I was like, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=485.67999999999995s)]
*  I'm all about American businesses. Like our family's done that before we got sued to, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  like we've done this. I get it. I want to support American business. Not if it's just for abject [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=495.92s)]
*  death for no reason around the world. Like I'm not there to support American business in genocide. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=501.44s)]
*  And like I talked to these guys, I'm like, you're making trillion dollar decisions. Have you [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  surveyed like your constituents? And they're like, well, no, but you know, but I'm sure they took [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=513.44s)]
*  six figures from Ray Theon. And so therefore, you know, they're on, they're on the team, you know, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=518.24s)]
*  they should get like sponsorship things. Who's, who's payroll are you on? Because it's shocking [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=523.2s)]
*  to me that a guy like me who grew up on the 70th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan, again, I don't [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=528.08s)]
*  forget that. I don't pretend it didn't happen. I'm like very self-aware that way, but it's like, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=535.6s)]
*  how do I know this? And you don't, like you live there. You live amongst these people. You [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=540.4000000000001s)]
*  literally chose to represent your district. I was there last week and you have no idea [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=545.44s)]
*  what they actually stand for. And it's disgusting. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  That it just thank you. Thank you for that. So I think one of the great promises of a second [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=557.84s)]
*  Trump term is that the party that nominated him will really change and change in a specific way. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=566.1600000000001s)]
*  It will represent its voters. The Democratic Party actually kind of represents its voters. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=573.84s)]
*  If you're into child castration, you've got a party, but why wouldn't normal people have [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=578.0s)]
*  a political party that represents them? I don't know how it got that way. And again, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=582.88s)]
*  it's sort of amazing, right? Cause you would, you would think they'd be able to get voted out, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  but you know what? There's no one's ever had again sort of being unafraid, right? They can [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=590.16s)]
*  go to their little constituents and they should go speak to a room, you know, other than maybe [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=594.72s)]
*  DJT, no one can assemble a room like this in conservative politics or frankly in politics, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=599.2s)]
*  but they go home and they speak to a group of five people that shows up and they tell them [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=603.52s)]
*  everything they want to hear everything. And then they go to DC and they vote opposite because [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=608.32s)]
*  there's no consequence in DC. You can be like 75% Republican. Hell, you could be 90% Republican, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=614.4s)]
*  as long as when it actually matters, you fold. It's an easy existence to be a weak Republican [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=622.32s)]
*  in Washington, DC. You know, you know, the Washington post isn't going to do the hit piece [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=627.52s)]
*  on you are, you know, I'd say they'd get invited to the cool person Christmas party, but we can't [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=632.48s)]
*  say Christmas party in DC, right? That's, you know, they can get away with a lot. And so [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=636.96s)]
*  you have people that they get away with it. They lie and they don't know that guy's really for me. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=642.96s)]
*  I mean, but have you looked at his voting record? No, he's just the Republican. It's sort of like [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=647.6s)]
*  why we end up with, why are the weakest Republicans in the most conservative States? Right? If you [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=651.52s)]
*  look at our, I'm speaking to you, Dan Crenshaw. Well, you go through the list. I mean, whether [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=657.52s)]
*  it's Oklahoma, you have senators that are like, I'm like with Republicans like those Utah, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=664.64s)]
*  with Republicans like Mitt Romney, who needs Democrats? But in the strong conservative States, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=671.12s)]
*  the Democrats sort of get together. They do this really well and they say, Hey, we're going to just [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=676.72s)]
*  forget about the Democrat. We're just going to install the weakest Republican. Half the Republicans [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=680.8s)]
*  don't know the difference. They think that's the guy that's leading. So we'll just vote for him. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=685.12s)]
*  And you end up with conservative States that have the least conservative leadership in the world. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=688.64s)]
*  And so so much of this is really an education process. People have to understand and start [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=692.64s)]
*  paying attention. And again, I think it takes, unfortunately, sort of whether it's addiction [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=698.3199999999999s)]
*  or otherwise, sometimes you have to hit rock bottom. And I think the American populace watching [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=703.68s)]
*  what we've been told has been a great success over the last three and a half years under Joe Biden. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=707.92s)]
*  That's the rock bottom. We actually needed to get people woken up and engaged in politics. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=713.84s)]
*  We could have never done something like this. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=718.56s)]
*  Five years ago, 10 years ago, it didn't exist. You got four people in a room. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=722.7199999999999s)]
*  People are fed up. Raise your hand if you're fed up. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=726.7199999999999s)]
*  But I don't, you may be missing something important and I'm getting this directly from Ben Stiller. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  The election of Kamala Harris will be, and I'm quoting now, the change we need. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=740.0s)]
*  By the way, just so we're clear, Kamala Harris has changed a lot. Unfortunately, it's all been for the worse. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=744.64s)]
*  What's amazing about this whole thing, I'm watching the media, she's the candidate of change. I go, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=754.08s)]
*  she's the vice president. Like she has been there. They want change. Like they cut and paste [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=759.92s)]
*  Joe Biden's policies when they finally, after a month of being the nominee, put up her policies. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  And they forgot to cover up the source code to say it's the same thing. Like [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=772.48s)]
*  what change is that going to be? Like she's the vice president to the most absentee president [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=777.12s)]
*  in the history of the United States. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=782.4s)]
*  Beyond, beyond the dementia, beyond the basics of the dementia, he spent 40 plus percent of his [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  presidency on vacation. If she wanted to do something, she had the opportunity to literally [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=795.12s)]
*  do anything. She could have taken the reins. And by the way, Joe Biden said that the other day. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=802.24s)]
*  What was it? One of the clowns on the view. When he was like, no, I delegated everything to her. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=806.32s)]
*  I trusted she totally ran with everything. And so the media is like, it's like she has a clean [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=810.8s)]
*  slate. It's like she's never been in politics. She's literally the daughter of a Marxist professor [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=816.32s)]
*  who was a San Francisco liberal who was rated the most radically left person in the United States [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=822.08s)]
*  Senate left of Bernie Sanders, because at least I think he kind of believed in at least American [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=827.2s)]
*  jobs. She couldn't care less. And they're like, no, no, no. Her political career started three [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=832.1600000000001s)]
*  weeks ago when, when she won one, you know, one, we use that word loosely in the word democracy. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=837.9200000000001s)]
*  They throw it around. She got zero votes, but you know, one, this position I'm like, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=845.84s)]
*  you saw it during the base. I'm not anti-gun like 10 days before mandatory gun buyback program. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=851.84s)]
*  They wanted that's part of their platform. Just she's not for taking part of your guns, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=857.36s)]
*  but like a mandatory program. The keyword in this is mandatory. Seems like you're actually [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=863.52s)]
*  really for taking your guns. Then four days later, she wants to Institute an assault weapons ban. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=868.96s)]
*  You know, the media will tell you whatever you need to hear to get you to vote that way. She [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=874.72s)]
*  will tell you anything. I mean, she's going to crack down on the board. I mean, she was the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=879.92s)]
*  borders are I got fact checked a couple of months ago when she was talking about it [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=884.24s)]
*  because I was like, she's the borders are if she wanted to do something about the border, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=889.36s)]
*  they had the materials there. All the labor was paid for. They just said to the workers, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=893.36s)]
*  it said, take the contract we gave you. It doesn't matter. Leave the materials. We'll [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=897.6s)]
*  sell it for pennies on the dollar. Now she's going to be tough on the border. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=901.12s)]
*  Like the fact that we still fall for it. We saw it during the Biden administration, the 2020 [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=905.6s)]
*  Democrat debates. Who's against fracking and American energy independence? Everyone's hand [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=910.48s)]
*  went up. You know, a couple of months later, the debate with my father, I would never do that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=915.28s)]
*  It's like, but you raised your hand like three weeks ago that you would do it. What do you like? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=921.28s)]
*  You would never do it. And the media, of course he would never do it because they knew [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=923.84s)]
*  not that it would be the end of the American energy sector, tens of thousands of good paying [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=927.84s)]
*  jobs for hardworking Americans, energy independence, and the national security that comes with it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=932.0s)]
*  They knew it would cost them votes in Pennsylvania and Michigan. And then on day one, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=937.12s)]
*  Keystone pipeline, first executive order. They just, they got rid of it all. They'll tell you [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=941.76s)]
*  anything you need to hear. You know, why would the media, I mean, I guess I've been in the media my [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=946.88s)]
*  whole life, but there's a self-respect problem at a certain point. If you're parroting the dumbest [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=951.92s)]
*  possible talking points that no child would believe, but you're doing it with a straight face. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=958.8s)]
*  If you're David Muir, who is judging by as abs, a great reporter. But why, like, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=962.48s)]
*  why are they willing to be used as basically prostitutes by a political party? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=971.84s)]
*  Again, they're just, they've become part of machine. They're not journalists. They're just [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=978.96s)]
*  propagandists. They're all on that team. There's a reason. What is it? 97% of all political [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=983.12s)]
*  donations from the media go to the Democrat party. You know, they're not the ones that are [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=987.52s)]
*  dealing with the consequences of illegal immigration, the rape. I mean, the statistics [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=992.0s)]
*  that came out, what was it? Yesterday, right? 16,000 rapists led into the country as part of [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=996.24s)]
*  this flow, like 13,000 murderers. They're reporting on it. That means they know, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1003.92s)]
*  they knew and they let them in anyway. I mean, think about the insanity of that. What civilization [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1011.44s)]
*  could survive being like, wow, you know, it's a rapist and a murderer, but fine, we're going to [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1016.72s)]
*  give this one a pass. I mean, that came out yesterday. Well, not just to pass, but a free [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1020.56s)]
*  iPhone and airplane tickets and housing vouchers. Those sex offenders and the rapists that came [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1027.76s)]
*  over across the border, they don't even have to register on the sex offender registries that [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1033.6s)]
*  Americans could do because we've been made second class citizens in our own country. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1038.08s)]
*  It's bad enough that they let them in. I mean, but then it's like, well, you know, we wouldn't [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1041.9199999999998s)]
*  want you to be stigmatized. You're only a rapist in your country. Like, think of how insane that [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1045.68s)]
*  is. Like, it's not sustainable, but again, no one's going to actually report on it. That's why I [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1051.2s)]
*  think, you know, what you're doing and maybe me, like, at least we have like a soapbox and have [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1055.76s)]
*  the balls to actually say this stuff because we need that. Sorry for, you know, sometimes you just [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1061.3600000000001s)]
*  got to say it. Sometimes there's words that are more effective than others. You know, I went with [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1072.56s)]
*  huevos, but not everyone speaks Spanish. I get it. Just in case someone is in fluent in huevos. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1076.72s)]
*  If, if, you know, if the campaign loses, if Trump loses, does the Republican party, like they can't [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1085.6799999999998s)]
*  wait to go back to the party of Cheney and Bush. That's the way it feels to me. I mean, and that's [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1093.36s)]
*  the idea. And again, it's why I'm so glad that stuff like this is happening. The fact that you [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1100.0s)]
*  can do this. When I see, you know, a JD on TV and then putting up crowds, like we finally actually [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1105.04s)]
*  have a bench. That was like, that was why I went so hard for him to be VP because there's so few [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1110.64s)]
*  non puppets in our party. Like I want to create a pathway to be like, I don't want just Donald [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1119.84s)]
*  Trump. He's my father. He's great. He's the guy we need at the time. And now, but like, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1124.72s)]
*  what about in four years after Trump? What about in 15 years? How do we create? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1129.92s)]
*  We've told you before about Hallow. It is a great app that I am proud to say I use. My whole family [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1140.08s)]
*  uses it's for daily prayer and Christian meditation. And it's transformative. As we head into the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1146.8s)]
*  start of school and the height of election season, you need it. Trust me, we all do things. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1152.32s)]
*  You're going to get crazier and crazier and crazier. Sometimes it's hard to imagine even what [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1157.04s)]
*  is coming next. So with everything happening in the world right now, it is essential to ground [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1161.6799999999998s)]
*  yourself. This is not some quack cure. This is the oldest and most reliable cure in history. It's [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1167.84s)]
*  prayer. Ground yourself in prayer and scripture every single day. That is a prerequisite [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1176.32s)]
*  for staying sane and healthy and maybe for doing better eternally. So if you're busy on the road, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1182.08s)]
*  headed to kids sports, there is always time to pray and reflect alone or as a family, but it's [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1187.28s)]
*  hard to be organized about it. Building a foundation of prayer is going to be absolutely [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1192.56s)]
*  critical as we head into November, praying that God's will is done in this country and that peace [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1196.8799999999999s)]
*  and healing come to us here in the United States and around the world. Christianity obviously is [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1202.24s)]
*  under attack everywhere. That's not an accident. Why is Christianity, the most peaceful of all [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1208.0s)]
*  religions, under attack globally? Did you see the opening of the Paris Olympics? There's a reason [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1213.68s)]
*  because the battle is not temporal. It's taking place in the unseen world. It's a spiritual battle, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1219.04s)]
*  obviously. So try Hallow. Get three months completely free at Hallow. That's Hallow.com [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1225.04s)]
*  slash Tucker. If there's ever a time to get spiritually in tune and ground yourself in [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1231.28s)]

*  Hallow.com slash Tucker. And now I understand I am not the upstanding citizen that Hunter Biden is. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1243.04s)]
*  I am working on getting better, but I have a feeling if that was my laptop, it'd be a problem. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1248.8s)]
*  Well, I'm pretty sure that most people in this room don't understand because you never talk about [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1260.1599999999999s)]
*  it, but I happen to watch it. I mean, they really tried to send you to prison. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1265.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, I knew that. And again, it was one of those. Even my lawyers were like, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1270.08s)]
*  you can't go on TV that night and talk about these things. Everything you say can and will [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1275.92s)]
*  be used against you. They were trying to throw me in jail. And I was like, you don't understand. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1280.48s)]
*  I'm just not built that way. It doesn't matter. But what was interesting after 50 hours of [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1285.76s)]
*  testimony, again, just so we're clear, Adam Schiff, the head of the intelligence committee, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  I use that word loosely. I was the one that crowned the term Adam Bull Schiff and or full of Schiff. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1294.24s)]
*  But like they want to try you for treason. Just so we're clear, that's a crime punishable by death. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1306.4s)]
*  For me these days, that's like an average Tuesday. You get used to it. But again, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1311.68s)]
*  I had to fight. And then two years later, these lawyers, these high-priced guys that are just, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1318.8000000000002s)]
*  they're weak. And I get the game, but I was like, I can't just win the legal battle. I actually also [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1322.4s)]
*  have to sort of win the PR battle, the public perception, because I'm just not going to roll [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1327.3600000000001s)]
*  over. And two years later, they're like, you know what? You're right. If you just curled up in a ball [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1331.12s)]
*  and died, that's exactly what they wanted. That would have just been the start of a much worse, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1336.0s)]
*  much more. If they smell that blood in the water, if you're not going to defend yourself, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1342.2399999999998s)]
*  if you're going to roll over and be a weakling like they're used to, that's just the beginning. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1346.1599999999999s)]
*  That's when it gets worse. And so you see that. And like I was talking about these Republicans, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1351.4399999999998s)]
*  you shouldn't build up a guy like JD because one day I want to make millions of dollars [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1357.04s)]
*  being your campaign guy, taking pieces. I was like, I'm not doing this for me. Like I'm doing [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1360.88s)]
*  this for my country. I'm doing this. I want to leave my children a country they recognize. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1365.7600000000002s)]
*  What I, I watched the JD thing happen and I'm just, I'm just so grateful, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1371.8400000000001s)]
*  truly grateful for what you did. And I admire the reasons you did a big part of that too, man. It [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1378.0s)]
*  was, I'm not going to admit that, but I will say that it happened despite the wishes of, you know, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1382.4s)]
*  some of the biggest donors in the Republican party. And I just don't think people who aren't [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1388.72s)]
*  from DC understand how rare that is. Almost nothing happens against the wishes of the biggest donors. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1392.88s)]
*  That only made it so much more personal. You know, and again, we don't need to go through [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1398.16s)]
*  the names, but it's a lot of power. It's like, Oh, that guy's going up now. I'm just going harder. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1400.96s)]
*  Now I think I expended about 4,000% of my political capital with my father, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1405.44s)]
*  you know, that month. I may never gain it back, but then I, but now I watch JD on the Sunday shows. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1410.32s)]
*  I watch him get up on there with these hostile communist media and just dismantle them one by [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1416.8s)]
*  one. And every Sunday, every time he's on TV, I'm like, I am vindicated because no one else in our [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1422.24s)]
*  party, you know, but for perhaps you or me would actually, you know, maybe a couple others, but [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1428.56s)]
*  no one that was in the running would actually have the guts to get out there and do that and [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1433.44s)]
*  do it effectively and do it each and every day, you know, cause we're not in a fair fight, right? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1439.52s)]
*  I mean, it's like we got to, you know, everyone's like, it's our ideas versus their ideas. I go, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1444.48s)]
*  no, no, no, it's our ideas that are smothered and censored and suppressed and cut off. And it's [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1448.72s)]
*  their ideas that are artificially boosted by a trillion dollar big tech enterprise by a trillion [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1455.04s)]
*  dollars in mainstream media that is functioning literally as the marketing department of the other [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1460.64s)]
*  side. Like that's not a fair fight. The fact that like, if I was running the Democrats, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1465.3600000000001s)]
*  we'd be winning elections like 99.992.001. That's how lopsided it is. Like, but their ideas are so [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1469.76s)]
*  insane. They've gone so far. It's hard to rationalize it. I'm a kid that grew up in Manhattan. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1478.48s)]
*  Like I have friends that are like Democrats and liberals. And it's like, most of them are like, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1484.72s)]
*  okay, well, we're kind of jumping the shark on some of this stuff. And some have just lost their [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1490.4s)]
*  minds. But you see it with the stuff with RFK. I mean, like a Kennedy is now endorsing Donald Trump. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1494.4s)]
*  And not only endorsing Donald Trump, but by endorsing Donald Trump, losing, I don't know, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1508.24s)]
*  like all of his friends and watching his own family denounce him. And he's doing it anyway. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1514.16s)]
*  And that's what it is. That, you know what? It's exactly the point. That was the story. Like you [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1520.64s)]
*  guys all remember the escalator ride down before the announcement back June 16th, 2015. It was [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1525.84s)]
*  actually one of those moments where like, I was like, just, I'm always impressed with my father, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1533.36s)]
*  but like that one, like he just got the world. Like I was like, this is why, like he understands [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1538.08s)]
*  the world. Like most people don't before the escalator ride, there was an elevator ride. It [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1541.68s)]
*  was the whole family going down from his office and you know, then it became him and Melania. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1546.0s)]
*  And he just looks me a dead pan in the eyes and he goes, and now we find out who our real friends [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1550.0s)]
*  are. And it wasn't that he's just running. He just, he knew, he knew what would happen. All [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1554.4s)]
*  the Hollywood people that was kissing his, well, maybe there's children. So kissing his butt on a [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1561.2s)]
*  daily basis and the billionaires in New York that, you know, just wanted to be seen with him and or [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1566.72s)]
*  on TV with him or whatever. He's like, that all ends right now. But more importantly, like, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1571.68s)]
*  like RFK who I've become really good friends with in the last couple of months and really [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1577.28s)]
*  worked on that one too. More importantly, he knew what was going to happen. He knew the consequence [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1580.16s)]
*  and he did it anyway. Like that's, that's guts. You know, that's, that's real courage. You know, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1586.48s)]
*  we're lacking in courage. That was real courage. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1599.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, especially because the thing that most people fear above all things is exile [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1602.1599999999999s)]
*  is being cast out is being the weird kid, you know, is, is having all the people you liked and [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1608.8799999999999s)]
*  whose praise you so enjoyed reject you. Like people will do anything to avoid that. That is [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1615.52s)]
*  like the bravest thing there is in my opinion. Why were you, but you didn't need to do that. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1622.32s)]
*  You could have, I mean, why didn't you just stay in New York? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1628.96s)]
*  Listen for, you know, for me, it's just sort of, again, I guess I found out I have enough of the [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1632.96s)]
*  Trump gene to just be like, okay, we're in a fight. I'm going to fight. And then, you know, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1637.28s)]
*  and he's not my, even my dad, he's like, like Don Jr. He's the radical, you've heard him say [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1641.52s)]
*  that he's the radical conservative of the family. But I was always that way. Like, you know, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1646.0s)]
*  I shut up when it made sense. Cause like we're building buildings in Manhattan and Chicago and [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1650.32s)]
*  around me. It's like, fine. You know, my first political fundraiser was literally for Andrew [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1654.6399999999999s)]
*  Cuomo. It wasn't cause I wanted to support it. No, hear me out. It wasn't because I wanted to [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1659.52s)]
*  support a Democrat. It was because he was the attorney general of New York. And if you're going [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1664.48s)]
*  to build a building, he's the guy that signs off on your offering plan. So you play the game. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1667.36s)]
*  It was like my father in the debate with Hillary was like, well, Donald Trump doesn't pay taxes. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1671.84s)]
*  He go, yeah. And if you wanted to do something about taxes that your billionaire friends also [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1676.88s)]
*  don't pay you to change it in the tax code when you were in the Senate for it, but you're not [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1682.0s)]
*  going to do that. That makes me smart, not stupid. So you have to ask, understand the game. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1687.0400000000002s)]
*  How long before Andrew Cuomo becomes a Republican? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1693.2800000000002s)]
*  I look at that guy and I'm like, I just judge everything on testosterone level. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1699.2s)]
*  And like Tim Walz is the perfect Democratic man. I mean, you can just feel the self hate and the [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1703.52s)]
*  creepiness and the passive aggression, the sweaty palms, nothing about it. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1712.56s)]
*  A couple of weeks ago when they're like the Republican, the party, they fear Tim Walz. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1719.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm watching him like prance out. Like I'm like, I'm like, but no, but that's what they think is [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1724.0s)]
*  masculine. I'm like, I don't know, man. I wouldn't last like three seconds with anyone I know. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1729.28s)]
*  But Andrew Cuomo, who I think was a horrible governor and horrible during COVID, I'm not in [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1735.52s)]
*  any way endorsing Andrew Cuomo, but you know, not a low T character. So like how long can he remain [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1740.8799999999999s)]
*  in that party? I think by the way, I think both Cuomo brothers, like Chris Cuomo is like a frat [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1746.24s)]
*  boy meathead. Like, do you, does he really believe a three year old should get transgender surgery? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1750.6399999999999s)]
*  He's playing that game and he's getting paid well to do it. And sometimes you need to put out the [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1757.36s)]
*  guy that looks like the masculine guy. And it's like, come on, like, you know, those guys are one [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1761.52s)]
*  day they're going to be like, okay, we were just kidding. Like it's just, there's a hundred percent [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1765.2s)]
*  chance of that. A hundred percent chance. I know these guys for years. Like, you know, like I said, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1768.24s)]
*  with, with Andrew, I mean his like mother used to sit next to my grandmother at the salon in Queens, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1773.68s)]
*  New York. Like we go back a long way. And so when he did that, like abrupt turn, that's when you're [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1780.1599999999999s)]
*  like, the politics is such nonsense. Like I, you know, I'd see that I got to be a fly on the wall [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1786.08s)]
*  on these things. And he would back channel through me because I was best friends with one of his [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1790.72s)]
*  biggest fundraisers. Like it was a big real estate guy in New York. And they'd be like, all right, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1793.76s)]
*  we're going to do this. We're going to do that. We're going to do it. And he's like, thanks for [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1797.52s)]
*  setting that up, Don. The administration got us everything we needed. But the second he got on TV, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1800.0s)]
*  it was politic, it was politically expedient to just lie about it. You know, just telling you the [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1804.72s)]
*  opposite. It was almost honestly, I almost had like, I had a lot more respect, frankly, for Gavin [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1811.2s)]
*  Newsom in California when he was like, you know what? Trump said he was going to get us this and [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1815.1200000000001s)]
*  he did. Yeah. I was like, at least he's being intellectually honest, but Cuomo, whether he [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1818.72s)]
*  wanted to continue his political rear, you know, the media was like everyone now in the room, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1823.3600000000001s)]
*  they're a Cuomo sexual. Like, like he was this big sex symbol all of a sudden. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1827.92s)]
*  Wait, what is it? Me too. And that was over. That's like a whole new category of Cuomo sexual. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1832.0s)]
*  You don't see it. None was saying that. They're like all these women for Cuomo, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1836.48s)]
*  they were Cuomo sexual. Let me just be on the record. I'm against Cuomo sexuality. I'm with you. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1839.12s)]
*  But he knew what was really going on. He had the opportunity to be honest, but he wasn't able to [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1845.04s)]
*  forego the, hey, anything you say against Trump, like we'll make you a hero. We're going to elevate [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1850.4799999999998s)]
*  your stature in the Democrat party. We're going to give you that shot at the presidency next. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1856.0s)]
*  You just have to bastardize literally everything you know to be good and true about what was going [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1861.52s)]
*  on. And so, you know, that was, that was hard to watch because I was part of some of these [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1866.4s)]
*  conversations. So what did, I mean, what do your friends, you know, the guys you grew up with or [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1869.76s)]

*  it was one of the more refreshing things in life. That doesn't mean it wasn't brutal and sort of [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1889.68s)]
*  like a shock at the time, but like there are guys that I've been friends with for life. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1894.48s)]

*  what do you mean? I just believe in you and I don't believe in it, but like it's just a show of [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1912.32s)]
*  support. And then there's the guys that would be like texting me, hey Don, I love everything that [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1917.52s)]
*  you're doing. I like, you guys are great. Keep it up, keep it up. And then I'd watch them on [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1922.56s)]
*  Facebook where there's an audience. I can't believe they'd say this. This is a disgrace. I'm like, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1926.48s)]

*  people in my life just gone. It's so refreshing. It was just cathartic and I was like, you know, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1966.16s)]
*  it was great. So what I was, I've been brooding about this, as I said earlier, all month, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1971.6799999999998s)]
*  have those relationships been replaced by new relationships? 100%. You know, I see it. And [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1978.6399999999999s)]
*  again, I, you know, the, the amount of people that I meet just around the country now, and frankly, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1984.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm that guy that shows up by myself and you know, like, you know, don't have teams of handlers that [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=1991.36s)]

*  You know, just like, yeah, I'm here. Like whatever, give me a mic. I'm not bad at this. I can probably [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2005.76s)]
*  handle it and be fine. You know, I've met so, so many incredible people and you know, it's been [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2009.1200000000001s)]
*  awesome actually. And, and so again, to your point about just sort of having a pulse, it's like those [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2015.68s)]
*  people that were like rich out of touch people, because there's no consequence to sort of, you [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2019.52s)]
*  know, well be really woke and we can virtue signal all day long. And you know, who cares if someone, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2024.24s)]
*  in a far off state is getting murdered. Like my kids have security driving them to school. It's [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2029.44s)]
*  like those people have been replaced by like real Americans who are just genuinely good people. And [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2032.96s)]
*  like, and it's been awesome for me. It's been awesome. I believe that. I mean, just moving to [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2037.8400000000001s)]
*  Florida, right? It's like, I, I, like, I was a political refugee from the people's Republic of [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2043.3600000000001s)]
*  New York. Yeah. What's that been like moving to Florida? Honestly, it's surreal. And honestly, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2048.48s)]
*  I wasn't sure I'd like, you know, it's like, I've been coming here my whole life. We've had [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2058.08s)]
*  assets and like, we vacation here, but like, you know, I was like, you know, I love like the [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2061.6s)]
*  seasons and I love my cabin on the river. And you know, you know, what the stuff I'm into is like, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2066.72s)]
*  now Florida is kind of flat and like, now it's like very flat. Yeah. And now I'm like, I literally, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2070.24s)]
*  like you couldn't pay me to move back. Like you couldn't, no, like, you know, where I live, I [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2076.64s)]
*  mean, I can, I can show up to the nicest restaurant in town and like flip-flops and a t-shirt. And I'm [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2084.32s)]
*  usually that kind of, and it's like, Hey, what's going on? It's like, I feel like norm at cheers [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2088.0s)]
*  over an entire state with a population of like 25 million people. Like that is an awesome feeling. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2094.7200000000003s)]
*  That is, that is an awesome feeling. I mean, you, I don't know if people notice, but you're like [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2100.2400000000002s)]
*  bombing around, fine commercial. You're always out. How do people treat you? Honestly, listen, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2106.6400000000003s)]
*  when I do that, I go casually, but that's what I'm saying. When I, when I talk about the pulse, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2112.88s)]
*  like I can't, I literally can't name a negative instance in like a year. Like every once in a [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2117.36s)]
*  while you get some guy like, usually, you know, everyone's a bad-ass on the internet. Everyone's [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2122.6400000000003s)]
*  a tough guy, you know, behind a keyboard, but like face to face, it's like they shut up. But so, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2126.88s)]
*  you know, when I try just going into it, I took more, I took 75 selfies getting from like the door [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2132.56s)]
*  of the hotel here today to the elevator and back out. And it's like, so people have been great. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2137.28s)]
*  I literally can't name an instance that's been negative. And in, in 16, I'm not saying it was [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2142.8s)]
*  terrible, but it definitely was like, you know, 5% of it was physical reaction. 10% was a negative [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2150.4s)]
*  reaction. Like I can't remember like the last negative reaction I've gotten publicly. And now [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2155.92s)]
*  to what we sort of started on when I talk about what I see changing, the shift now is like, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2163.68s)]
*  it's demographics that you'd be like, no way. Like, you know, I was talking with Kimberly the [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2172.3199999999997s)]
*  other day. She's like, you know, the, the, the, the amount, like African-American men and women [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2179.12s)]
*  now coming up to me back, you guys, I love you. Like you have to win. Before there could have been [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2184.56s)]
*  some people be like, interesting, maybe take a selfie. Like, you know, screaming, make America [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2189.44s)]
*  great again across an airport. And they're like, you know, Hispanic, you know, just all of them. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2194.64s)]
*  You know, on the African-American side, it's definitely more men, but it's like we're in a [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2201.84s)]
*  place. It's like, Kim was like, you took a selfie with every black guy that was in this room came [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2205.44s)]
*  up to you to take a selfie. Like, be like, you gotta win. Like that would have never happened. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2211.28s)]
*  It's just, you know, the Hispanic demographic across the country, they're, they get what's [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2216.24s)]
*  going on. They understand what's happening. You know, the people who came into America legally [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2220.8799999999997s)]
*  and went through that process, like they're some of the greatest Patriots in our country. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2227.12s)]
*  Like, they get it. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2232.64s)]
*  And what's happening now is so insulting to them, to the rest of us who are born here, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2238.72s)]
*  they're using our country like a rental car, just bumping into things, not changing the oil. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2246.48s)]
*  They have no respect at all for our country, which we love. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2252.48s)]
*  Well, and that's precisely the point. I think the Democrat party is aware that they've literally [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2256.08s)]
*  ostracized the reliable floating blocks for the Democrat party. So it's like, well, you know, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2262.0s)]
*  rather than maybe do the right thing for them, you know, at the risk of like some offending, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2267.3599999999997s)]
*  maybe suburban women or something like that, whatever it may be, there's like, why don't we [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2271.52s)]
*  just import 20 million people who will be permanent dependents? Like I said, you know, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2274.8s)]
*  when you look at a graph, like I was talking about, you know, half a million known criminals, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2279.44s)]
*  you know, 16,000, you know, sex offenders, 13,000 murderers. They're like, ah, it's fine. It's just, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2283.6000000000004s)]
*  it's, you know, think about that. I mean, it's insane and people get it, but rather than just [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2290.6400000000003s)]
*  do the right thing for all of America, they're like, nah, we can't do that. We got to stick [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2296.4s)]
*  with our nonsense and this will just bring in 20 million people who, who will permanently be [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2300.4s)]
*  dependent on government. And if you're permanently dependent on government because you're unwilling, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2305.2000000000003s)]
*  incapable of doing it otherwise, yeah, you're going to be a Democrat voter. They recognize that [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2310.32s)]
*  this is not an anomaly. This is not out of the kindness of their hearts. There's a reason like [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2316.4s)]
*  a genius computer program or from Eastern Europe cannot get into America. That guy could create [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2321.6s)]
*  jobs, be a business, be a value add, you know, an actual political refugee from Havana, Cuba, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2327.12s)]
*  that's being shot at like, oh, that guy doesn't get the same treatment as if you come across the [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2333.6s)]
*  Southern border because they're escaping the system that the Democrats are trying to instill [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2337.52s)]
*  right here in America. They're not voting for that. Like, and like, I guess, you know, the, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2343.6s)]
*  the intro of like my political leanings is like, my mom escaped a communist country. She did so [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2351.8399999999997s)]
*  legally, maybe not legally leaving there, but legally getting in here. And like one of the, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2357.68s)]
*  and I don't think it was intentional. I think it was more about life than it was about politics. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2364.48s)]
*  But like the reason I sort of started feeling the way I always did about politics and life [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2368.24s)]
*  was because as a child, she was like, you're really lucky. Like you're really spoiled. You've [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2373.7599999999998s)]
*  been really blessed. Like you're going to go see how like the rest of the world lives. And so she [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2379.12s)]
*  sent me to what was then communist Czechoslovakia behind the iron curtain in the 1980s. I spoke the [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2383.3599999999997s)]
*  language fluently. I'd go spend like six weeks every summer there, like as I five, six, seven, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2388.08s)]
*  you know, until I went to college, basically, you know, I've waited in those bread lines. Like I can [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2392.88s)]
*  assure you, they are not as glamorous as Bernie Sanders would have you believe. You notice how [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2398.4s)]
*  there's no one in America, like espousing the values of like pre like, you know, fall of the [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2403.04s)]
*  wall, like in America, like if a system is so good, why are there no advocates for it who've [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2408.72s)]
*  actually lived under those systems? Like if it was so great, you'd think you'd have a couple of guys [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2414.8s)]
*  be like, nah, nah, we got to try it here. Only like, you know, these like virtue signaling clowns, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2419.36s)]
*  it's going to be different this time Tucker, you know, 20 million people dead. It's going to be [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2425.68s)]
*  different. You know, it doesn't happen that way. So, you know, I saw that. I remember it was weird. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2428.64s)]
*  It was one of the conversations I had with my grandfather early on. I was like, I saw the picture [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2434.08s)]
*  of my parents' wedding. I'm looking, I'm like, you know, it's in the little, you know, little [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2438.3199999999997s)]
*  communist building in Zlín, Czechoslovakia. And like, like why isn't my grandmother in the picture? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2443.44s)]
*  I'm a kid. Like, yeah, was she the one taking the picture? No. She wasn't in the picture because they, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2449.44s)]
*  the government wouldn't let them both leave because they knew both were never coming back [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2454.8s)]
*  if they were both. So they literally held someone as a political hostage to not go to their daughter's [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2460.4s)]
*  wedding because they understood that if they left the country, they're never coming back. Like what [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2464.7200000000003s)]
*  kind of system is that? And we're bringing that here right now. They're not even hiding from it [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2469.76s)]
*  anymore. Before we were like, you know, in 16, we're like, man, they're got a gun in communist. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2473.52s)]
*  Not really. Like they're saying these things out loud. Price controls on this. We're going to, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  everything. I mean, it's literally a playbook. They're not even pretending anymore. We have to [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2482.96s)]
*  be aware of that. And they're using violence as a political tool. I hate to say that. I hate to [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2486.96s)]
*  believe it. And I hate even to bring this up, but I'm going to. And if you don't want to talk about [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2492.64s)]
*  it, you don't have to. But from what I can tell, the Biden administration, which controls the [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2495.68s)]
*  security for the Trump campaign is withholding security. And that's, you know, an incitement to [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2501.28s)]
*  violence. That's election interference using the threat of violence. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2507.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, yeah. No, listen, it's a, it's a little hard. I mean, I have five young kids, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2512.0s)]
*  as we discussed, and I've now had to have 10 conversations about their grandfather, who they [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2522.6400000000003s)]
*  love, almost being killed because I've had to do it twice. Like as the nominee of one of the major [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2528.48s)]
*  parties and maybe the leading candidate for president of the United States. Like, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2535.84s)]
*  how does that happen even once? You know, I was with my daughter who, you know, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2539.92s)]
*  she spoke at the RNC. Some of you guys may have seen that. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2547.44s)]
*  Yeah, she's, she's a great kid. She's a competitive athlete. She's got it. Yeah, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2554.0s)]
*  but she was never political, but like she plays golf with my dad every weekend. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2558.48s)]
*  She was with me like, yeah, I got the rare call from my daughter. You know, again, when you're [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2563.12s)]
*  17, it's like, dad, I want to go fishing and spend time with you. I'm like, but who are you? And what [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2567.04s)]
*  have you done to Kai? You know, I got that call that Saturday. And so, you know, it's like, we're [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2570.56s)]
*  going fishing. Didn't matter what it was. We're going fishing. We're out there. We have a good, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2577.12s)]
*  you know, having a great day. And, you know, I get a call like, hey, you know, Don, your dad's been [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2580.08s)]
*  shot. I'm like, wait, what? Like there, you know, some calls you get that are good or bad. Like once [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2584.7999999999997s)]
*  when the call is your father's been shot, there's only degrees of bad. It's a question of how bad. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2589.76s)]
*  It's like, well, how bad, like, and, and what, and what we don't know. I'm like, well, so we [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2593.6000000000004s)]
*  don't know. And so we're out of there. I'm like, okay, we're going, we're going back home fast. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2600.7200000000003s)]
*  And I'm trying to call. I guess the one thing that was done right by Secret Service that day, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2605.2000000000003s)]
*  I guess they shut off communication. So I couldn't get in or out. Like, you know, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2608.2400000000002s)]
*  everything else seems like a total disaster. And I don't mean like one lapse of error. I'm like, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2611.76s)]
*  you let a shooter on a roof for 20 minutes. Like, you know, you knew about it 10 minutes [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2616.4s)]
*  before you still let the guy get on stage. You had him in your sights for a while. And like, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2621.2000000000003s)]
*  like, and I, and I'm, I know a lot of these guys. I, you know, I had a Secret Service [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2626.2400000000002s)]
*  detail for years. I understand the protocol. I'm best friends with some of these guys. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2630.48s)]
*  Some of these guys are diehard red-blooded Americans and others are journeyman bureaucrats. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2634.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, we, we seem to have gotten all of the bureaucrats that day, other than some of the guys, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2639.12s)]
*  you know, on my dad's team that day on the stage. And I'm like, that doesn't happen. So I'm going [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2643.76s)]
*  back with my daughter. You know, we're like, she's visibly upset because this is like her golfing [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2648.7200000000003s)]
*  buddy. Like, I walk in on my daughter and she's like talking for 25 minutes. I'm like, I like, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2654.0s)]
*  can you get off the phone with your friends? Like enough, like of this, like, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2657.6000000000004s)]
*  it was like, no, that was grandpa. I was like, really? And so she's there. We finally get, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2660.88s)]
*  you know, we finally, I'm watching some of the stuff on social, but I still don't know an answer. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2667.28s)]
*  Like, you know, then we finally get them on the phone. It's like, you know, we're okay. And I was [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2670.88s)]
*  like, okay, well, when I saw you get up like that, that was the most bad ass thing I've ever seen [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2675.36s)]
*  someone do. Like most of us, well, actually all of us go through our daily lives using all sorts of [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2679.84s)]
*  quote free technology without paying attention to why it's quote free. Who's paying for this and how [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2686.7200000000003s)]
*  think about it from it. Think about your free email account, the free messenger system used [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2694.7200000000003s)]
*  to chat with your friends, the free other weather app or game app you open up and never think about. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2699.76s)]
*  It's all free, but is it? No, it's not free. These companies aren't developing expensive products and [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2705.6000000000004s)]
*  just giving them to you because they love you. They're doing it because their programs take all [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2713.28s)]
*  your information. They hoover up your data, private personal data and sell it to data brokers and the [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2718.48s)]
*  government and all of those people who are not your friends are very interested in manipulating [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2725.2s)]
*  you and your personal political and financial decisions. It's scary as hell and it's happening [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2731.04s)]
*  out in the open without anybody saying anything about it. This is a huge problem and we've been [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2736.96s)]
*  talking about this problem to our friend, Eric Prince for years. Someone needs to fix this [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2741.9199999999996s)]
*  and he and his partners have and now we're partners with them and their company is called [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2747.04s)]
*  Unplugged. It's not a software company, it's a hardware company. They actually make a phone. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2751.04s)]
*  The phone is called Unplugged and it's more than that. The purpose of the phone is to protect you [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  from having your life stolen, your data stolen. It's designed from a privacy first perspective. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2763.6s)]
*  It's got an operating system that they made. It's called Messenger and other apps that help [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2772.56s)]
*  you take charge of your personal data and prevent it from getting passed around to data brokers [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2775.84s)]
*  and government agencies that will use it to manipulate you. Unplugged can mean it's to its [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2780.96s)]
*  customers. They will promise you and they mean it that your data are not being sold or monetized [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2785.84s)]
*  or shared with anyone. From basics like its custom Libertas operating system, which they wrote, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2790.96s)]
*  which is designed from the very first day to keep your personal data on your device. It also has, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2797.12s)]
*  believe it or not, a true on-off switch that shuts off the power. It actually disconnects your battery [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2802.56s)]
*  and ensures that your microphone and your camera are turned off completely when you want them to [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2808.64s)]
*  be. So they're not spying on you and say your bedroom, which your iPhone is. That's a fact. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2813.92s)]
*  So it is a great way, one of the few ways to actually protect yourself from big tech [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2819.68s)]
*  and big government to reclaim your personal privacy. Without privacy, there is no freedom. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2824.16s)]
*  The Unplugged phone, you can get a $25 discount when you use the code TUCKER at the checkout. So [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2829.68s)]
*  go to unplugged.com slash Tucker to get yours today. Highly recommended. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2834.96s)]
*  It should have never been allowed to happen. We all sort of know and understand that. And then, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2845.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, the sort of uncomfortable conversation for a little bit. And then finally, you know, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2848.96s)]
*  I'm usually the inappropriate one. And so I was like, okay, listen, Dad, most importantly, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2852.48s)]
*  how's the hair? Don, Don, the hair is fine, Don. Little bloody, lots of blood, but the hair is [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2858.4s)]
*  fine. And like, you know, you can see like Ivanka's eyes are rolling in that. But I was like, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2868.0s)]
*  we needed to break the ice. And I was like, everything was okay. But you know, the next day [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2874.2400000000002s)]
*  was Sunday and you're sort of getting over this adrenaline dump and you're figuring out all these [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2878.6400000000003s)]
*  lapses. At this point, I'm just furious, right? I'm, you know, going back and forth with my [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2882.2400000000002s)]
*  daughter. Going back and forth with Dan Bungie, you know, who's the Secret Service, you know, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2887.28s)]
*  and like all day long, like what? We're just getting each other more and more worked up. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2889.84s)]
*  And you know, but that Monday morning I woke up and it's, I get a call. It's like my daughter, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2895.1200000000003s)]
*  like, you know, and she's like, Dad, it was the week of the RNC. She's like, it's Monday morning [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2899.92s)]
*  over the RNC. She's like, I want to speak at the RNC. And I'm like, what, what, what, what, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2904.8s)]
*  what, like, I'm like, that's kind of a big one. Like that's like your first speech ever. Like, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2910.96s)]
*  when I was that age, I'd been like nervous in front of like 10 people in my classroom. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2916.3999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, but she, she understood sort of what it was. And she was like, I, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2920.96s)]
*  I'm sick of this crap. I'm sick of the lies about him. I'm sick of the, and like, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2925.2s)]
*  so, you know, she did that. But you know, the fact then, you know, then I have to have a [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2931.44s)]
*  conversation with her two months later, it almost happened again. And by the way, just so we're [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2936.16s)]
*  clear, within minutes, you know, you have Hillary Clinton saying, he's literally the greatest [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2942.4s)]
*  threat to democracy ever. He's worse than Hitler. I'm like, I don't know. We had a prosperous [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2946.56s)]
*  economy. We had no wars. We went from prosperity to poverty as a country. We went from peace to [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2950.8s)]
*  war. And like, I don't know, probably, but they've been doing it for nine years. You're telling me [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2958.4s)]
*  it's not on purpose. You're telling me it's not intentional radicalization. You're telling me [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2964.7200000000003s)]
*  they're not asking for it. I mean, this week I had to get the call, be like, hey, you're like [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2969.44s)]
*  one of the Iran targets, because, you know, if they can't get your dad, they want to inflict [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2973.2000000000003s)]
*  as much damage and they know you're a lower profile and, you know, you can do just as much [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2976.8s)]
*  damage to someone. But maybe, you know, if it's the son or, you know, someone else in the family, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2980.48s)]
*  maybe that won't elicit a response from the American military so they can, they can inflict [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2984.96s)]
*  pain without actually doing it. Like, that's not a conversation I love having. I've grown [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2988.96s)]
*  probably far too accustomed to it, but like, you know, but it's why we just all have to say [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2993.44s)]
*  enough of this stuff. You know, like, the media attacks, like, it's disgusting with no actual [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=2999.04s)]
*  evidence. You know, they say every day for nine years, like, of course they're asking for it to [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3007.04s)]
*  happen. Like, there's no other plausible explanation. It's like, Wuhan Lab League, like, of course it [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3011.84s)]
*  came from the lab that studies the exact virus in the town that was ground zero for the virus. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3017.2000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no. Anthony Fauci said it didn't and if you agree with him and you're a doctor, you'll lose [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3022.96s)]
*  your government funding and you'll lose your research grant. I got, yeah, I got cancelled for [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3027.52s)]
*  that one at the time because I was like, um, like, of course it did. You're not a virologist, Don. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3034.0s)]
*  I was like, you don't have to be a virologist. You just have to not be an imbecile. Like, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3040.7200000000003s)]
*  like, you, like, it's not that hard. Like, of course it did, but like all great conspiracy [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3045.52s)]
*  theories, we know, we find out the truth a couple weeks later. So, I don't understand [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3052.48s)]
*  two things. One, how the Congress hasn't gotten to the bottom of the security lapses. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3059.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, like, how hard is that? No one's been fired. Not one person's been fired. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3068.56s)]
*  And the entire federal government for that. It's almost like there's a lot of people that [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3073.68s)]
*  are okay with it, Tucker. I mean, no, but like, what else is it? I mean, we've had some [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3079.2799999999997s)]
*  conversations with people that we can't sort of, we're not going to out because they know more than [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3083.6s)]
*  we do, but it's like, well, they have the ability to get that information and they're not given it [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3088.0s)]
*  by the three-letter agencies that are literally supposed to report to them. It's like, no, no, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3093.3599999999997s)]
*  we know better. At some point, like, where's the point where you have like a sit-in in someone's [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3098.72s)]
*  office? Like, I'm not moving until you answer the question. Or we cut off the funding immediately. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3104.3999999999996s)]
*  Or you just, no, seriously, you have a march on, you know, DHS headquarters where 500,000 people [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3109.9199999999996s)]
*  show up and say, we're not leaving until you give us the answer. Yeah, they'll all get thrown in [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3118.72s)]
*  jail for being insurrectionists, whether they do any insurrection, you know. No, it's January 6th, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3122.3999999999996s)]
*  it was literally, it's almost amazing. It was the first unarmed insurrection in the history of the [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3126.88s)]
*  world. The only people that were armed were the tour guides that magically worked for the FBI that [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3131.84s)]
*  were all there. They couldn't release the videos because it would expose too many of their assets [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3136.72s)]
*  implanted in the group. I'm like, well, why didn't any of those assets actually try to stop it? It's [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3142.4s)]
*  almost like it was a plan. Almost, almost, almost. Like, but you know, there are grandmothers that [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3145.92s)]
*  are sitting in jails where they were within 500 miles of DC or they're taking selfies inside the [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3154.24s)]
*  velvet ropes. Like, that's not an insurrectionist. They didn't even know what they're supposed to be [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3159.3599999999997s)]
*  in the room. Also, isn't it, doesn't it belong to them? Yeah. Isn't it the people's house? Isn't [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3162.16s)]
*  this our country? Don't we pay for it? Didn't our ancestors build it? I thought that was the story. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3169.12s)]
*  They go to jail, but if you burn down Seattle or Portland or Kidosha, Wisconsin, you know, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3174.4799999999996s)]
*  you get to be vice president under the Democrat regime. You can allow that to happen. It's fine. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3182.24s)]
*  There's no consequence. No one goes to jail. Billions of dollars of damage. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3186.64s)]
*  Actually people murdered. That's different. The existing vice president who's running at the top [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3189.6s)]
*  of the ticket can fundraise for those people publicly. And the guy that let the city, the [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3195.3599999999997s)]
*  major city in the state that he's the governor of can allow it to burn down. And you know, that's [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3201.68s)]
*  fine. As long as you put tampons in boys bathrooms, like you're forgiven. It's okay. No, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3207.04s)]
*  no, no. You're, you're, you know, what makes you a real leader. What are you supposed to do with those? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3212.7200000000003s)]
*  Don't even tell me. So vote, vote, call all your friends, vote like your Republic depends on it, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3217.2s)]
*  because it does. It does. I, you know, I'm not worried in Florida, but I'm sure everyone from [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3225.36s)]
*  Florida is basically from somewhere else. You know, make sure your friends in the swing state, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3231.92s)]
*  you know, apathy is what's going to kill this because they're going to play games. I listen, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3236.4s)]
*  like we discussed, you know, if they showed up with 12 billion votes on, you know, the morning [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3241.28s)]
*  after election day, they'll tell you it's the most free of fair election ever. We like, like we can't [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3245.2000000000003s)]
*  take any of it for granted. You know, you discuss sort of polling in your opening. It's like the [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3250.48s)]
*  polling is all BS, right? Half of it's designed to demoralize you. The other half is designed to [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3255.6s)]
*  make you overconfident. None of it matters. The only poll that matters is the final tally on [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3259.92s)]
*  November 5th. But the way I look at it, in many of the places, usually those places that are swing [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3265.28s)]
*  states, you know, they're controlled entirely by a Democrat legislature or the Republicans are so [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3270.32s)]
*  weak that they're worried about the bad article in the local paper. Like to win by win, we got to [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3274.0800000000004s)]
*  win by five. That's it. Act accordingly. So given, and this is my last question, but I, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3278.96s)]
*  I'm looking for hope. The core problem is corruption. Every institution, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3287.36s)]
*  many institutions in American life have been revealed to be corrupt. It's so distressing to [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3291.52s)]
*  see it. So demoralizing to watch it. It has to be fixed. It's too corrupt to continue. If they can [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3295.52s)]
*  allow the other parties, presidential candidate to be shot in the face and no one's even fired, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3300.96s)]
*  then we've reached a point where can't have any more of this. So starting January 20th, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3305.44s)]
*  do you have hope that that corruption can be rooted out? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3310.96s)]
*  I do. I do. The reality is this, and I honestly, I think it's why both sides, frankly, are going [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3315.28s)]
*  so much harder against my father this time around. Now he actually knows. He knows who the liars are. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3325.44s)]
*  He knows who the scumbags are. He knows that I'm on your side. It's like, you know, here's a tweet [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3332.6400000000003s)]
*  from seven minutes ago when I walked into your endorsement to get an endorsement. You know, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3337.52s)]
*  I'll disregard the last five years of everything I've been saying that's bad about you. Now he [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3341.76s)]
*  knows, and that's why he's a greater threat. Right? When he before, you know, when we were [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3346.8s)]
*  talking about transition last time around, it's like, I was like, so who do you know in DC? It's [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3351.6800000000003s)]
*  like, I've been in DC for less than two days of my entire life. He didn't know. So you trust even [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3355.6800000000003s)]
*  those people on your side. You had no other way to do it. You know, in business, it's different. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3360.8s)]
*  It's like, you sort of understand what people's motivation is. It's usually profit or, you know, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3364.0800000000004s)]
*  in politics, like your best friend will snake you to get a good favorable article that lets [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3369.44s)]
*  him get the next consulting gig. Like they'll bastardize everything they believe in. There's [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3374.4s)]
*  no, there's no honor in it. There's no, there's no, no one actually has a belief system in [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3379.28s)]
*  Washington, DC, but for three or four people, the belief system is power and they'll do whatever [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3384.08s)]
*  they can to have that power. There's no real consequence to a loss. So if your party's not [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3390.08s)]
*  in charge, fine. You sit in the wings waiting till the next opportunity for you to make, you know, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3393.52s)]
*  your seven figure gig a month for, you know, representing the scumbags. I think the fact that [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3398.7200000000003s)]
*  he gets that now, he's seen those people turn on him. I think that scares, again, especially the [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3404.2400000000002s)]
*  people on our side that much more. So there is hope beyond that. There's hope that, you know, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3409.52s)]
*  people also getting it there, they're showing up there. They're not just listening to sort of [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3415.04s)]
*  the two minutes, you know, of news in the background of being like, Oh, that must be true. I saw it on [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3420.32s)]
*  CNN. It's like, no, it's probably the opposite of that. And so, you know, again, the fact that, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3424.8s)]
*  you know, we're five weeks out from an election, we're filling up a stadium like this of people, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3433.44s)]
*  like, it's hard to, that's amazing. I mean, people, they're now finally vested in the success of their [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3437.92s)]
*  country. That should have always been, but we took it for granted as Americans. I mean, when I got [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3448.0s)]
*  into this, I was naive, man. I was a baby. What I like, well, listen, you know, the CIA and FBI said [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3452.32s)]
*  I was colluding with Russia. I must have taken a selfie with someone. Like there had to be something [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3460.0800000000004s)]
*  to it. I genuinely believed there had to be some truth to it because I wanted to believe everything [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3464.48s)]
*  I had been told about our country. And it turns out it was all nonsense. There doesn't have to be [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3469.84s)]
*  any truth to any of it. So then I was sort of fighting to preserve an America I believe [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3475.12s)]
*  existed for my kids. Turns out, you know, it may have never existed, but certainly not in my lifetime [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3482.96s)]
*  and maybe longer than that. It was just sort of, you know, a visual representation. You're like, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3488.7999999999997s)]
*  we must get into these wars because of patriotic reason. I'm like, well, I don't know. Like, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3494.48s)]
*  why? It's like, why I get in trouble still for questioning, you know, what's going on in Ukraine? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3498.4s)]
*  It's like, what's our benefit? You know, there's no benefit. You know, it's insane. And so now, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3502.64s)]
*  I'm fighting to actually make real the myth that I was sold about our country, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3512.3199999999997s)]
*  to actually make that exist. That's why I do this now. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3521.2s)]
*  That I'll just say, and I mean this truly, I sincerely hope that you will run for president [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3524.4s)]
*  at some point. I mean that. You never know, folks. You never know. How about this? Let's worry about [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3535.6s)]
*  2024 right now. But beyond that though, not just president. You know, that's the thing. Like, hey, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3546.4s)]
*  I've been through it. I've done my testimony for treason. I don't want to just win the president [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3554.96s)]
*  without the House or without the Senate. Like, that'll be hell for me and my family, for everyone, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3560.64s)]
*  for the—and for America. Like, we gotta win everything. We gotta win down to the dog catcher. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3567.28s)]
*  We gotta win our state legislatures so we can like, I don't know, maybe educate our children. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3575.2799999999997s)]
*  So maybe they learn like math rather than the 4,379 genders. Like, we gotta win, you know, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3581.2799999999997s)]
*  all of our school boards. We gotta win everything because we've sat back as conservatives, whether [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3589.52s)]
*  we're building up businesses or—I get it. It's hard to get involved. It's hard to get in that fray. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3596.3999999999996s)]
*  No one probably understands it better than, you know, my family other than maybe RFK Jr. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3601.76s)]
*  You know, like, no one understands the consequence better than perhaps the collective, like, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3607.2000000000003s)]
*  ticket now. But like, we don't have a choice, or it's not going to exist. Again, they're saying [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3613.44s)]
*  all of the things. Like, you think if they can literally, you know, if impeaching Trump doesn't [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3621.28s)]
*  work twice, well then we'll just try to take his businesses and we'll fine him half a billion [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3626.72s)]
*  dollars for paying back loans on time with interest. We'll change the statute of limitation of [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3632.24s)]
*  certain things for one year, not in perpetuity because we want to be able to, like they did in [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3637.4399999999996s)]
*  New York. The state of New York changed the statute of limitations to allow them to go back 30 years [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3641.68s)]
*  for a nonsense case because they figured, hey, we could probably get a favorable jury. The second [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3647.9199999999996s)]
*  they charged Trump, it changed his back. Is that a democracy? Like, think about it. I mean, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3652.08s)]
*  if that doesn't work, you know, well, we'll try to throw him in jail. And if that doesn't work, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3661.92s)]
*  we'll just scream loudly enough that he's worse than Hitler to make people literally try to kill [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3668.88s)]
*  him and then not give him the appropriate security protocols to protect him. Like, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3672.64s)]
*  if they can do that to Donald Trump, a guy that has the means to be able to fight back, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3678.48s)]
*  a guy that has arguably one of the greatest political platforms ever assembled, what's some [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3683.92s)]
*  of the greatest, most patriotic people backing him, the soapbox to get it out there. If they can do it [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3687.6800000000003s)]
*  to him, who can't they do it to? But more importantly, if they will do it to him and they'll do it to him [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3695.36s)]
*  so aggressively and so flagrantly, who won't they do it to? You think it stops with Trump? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3701.92s)]
*  No, no, no, guys. Each and every one of you is in the firing line. At this point, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3709.2000000000003s)]
*  almost no pun intended. Like, we have to act accordingly. We have to take back our country. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3715.84s)]
*  And so, you know, we're used to, you know, how many times have you heard it in your [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3724.48s)]
*  journalistic career talk? It's literally the most important election ever. You know, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3730.08s)]
*  some guy running for dog catcher. It's like, it's literally, like, the world depends on this. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3734.56s)]
*  Like, you know, we're used to hearing that. Like, this time that's real. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3740.3199999999997s)]
*  Look at the stakes. Look at where we are as a world. Look at where we are as a country. The [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3744.96s)]
*  fact that it's even close in some of these places show just how brainwashed so many people are. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3749.04s)]
*  Again, it's not a fair fight. We know that. It doesn't matter. To win, like, we actually have [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3754.96s)]
*  to play by the rules they've set. You know, elections. Like, I was in Europe last week for [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3761.28s)]
*  it today. They're like, what do you mean, like, you don't have, like, paper ballots? You don't [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3767.28s)]
*  have, like, voter ID? These basic things. They're like, these are socialist countries, and they [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3772.08s)]
*  think we're insane. Like, that's, you know, but guess what? To win, you have to play [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3778.4s)]
*  the hand that you're dealt. They have dealt that hand. They have stacked that hand. They've done [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3787.84s)]
*  everything. It doesn't matter. We still have to play. They want us to be demoralized. They want [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3791.92s)]
*  us to take our ball and go cry to mommy. Like, they would love to see that. We can't do it. We [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3796.1600000000003s)]
*  have to fight. You know, the same resolve I saw from my father coming up that day, we all have [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3803.68s)]
*  to have that same spirit because that is the embodiment of the America we know and love. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3808.16s)]
*  We just have to come out and actually do it all. Donald Trump Jr., ladies and gentlemen. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWvqVu_FYU&t=3813.8399999999997s)]
