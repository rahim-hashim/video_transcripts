# The 5 Blockades Keeping You From Success, and How to Overcome Them
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ)
*  There's a spirit of sadness and discouragement that has descended on the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You can feel it, you could see it in the New Year's celebrations that weren't very celebratory. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=4.4s)]
*  And you certainly notice it when you talk to people, people you know well, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=8.8s)]
*  people who are paying some attention, even those who aren't. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=12.24s)]
*  They seem down. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  They're anxious, of course, about this year, which is going to transform the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=16.4s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=19.2s)]
*  But they also seem a little defeated and sad. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=20.96s)]
*  What is that exactly? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=24.0s)]
*  You don't need to be a guru to sense it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=26.0s)]
*  It's real. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=29.04s)]
*  And how should you respond to it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=30.24s)]
*  And so that's a question we've been thinking about a lot this week. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=31.84s)]
*  And one of the people we want to pose it to is a very smart man, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=34.24s)]
*  one of the most famous people in the world, Tony Robbins, a life strategist, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=36.56s)]
*  obviously one of the bestselling authors in the country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=39.6s)]
*  And he joins us now in studio. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=41.84s)]
*  Tony, thanks a lot for coming on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=43.68s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=44.72s)]
*  Do you know what I mean when I say the spirit of sadness? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=46.16s)]
*  Do you see it around you? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=48.32s)]
*  And what is that? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  It's sadness and it's anger, too. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=50.56s)]
*  You can't travel without seeing it with people on airlines. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  It's pretty extreme. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=54.8s)]
*  People have lost their patience after COVID. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=55.44s)]
*  But the anger usually comes from fear. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=58.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of fear about the future because there's not a compelling future. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  If you ask people what's the vision for the future for this country, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=63.36s)]
*  for days of John F. Kennedy, he would talk about where we're going to go. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=66.64s)]
*  We're going to go to the moon. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=69.6s)]
*  We're going to advance from the world. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=70.32s)]
*  We're going to bring freedom everywhere. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=72.08s)]
*  Reagan had his view of the city on the hill and here's what we're going to become. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=73.52s)]
*  But if you ask today, I don't think most people have a clear vision. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=77.68s)]
*  And without a vision, people perish. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=80.24s)]
*  It's in a really good book. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=81.52s)]
*  I call it a good book. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  But what's missing is a compelling future. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=84.72s)]
*  What I mean by compelling future is anybody can deal with the difficult today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=86.56s)]
*  If they know they have a really amazing tomorrow they're moving towards. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  But when people start thinking young people today, I'm not going to have a kid because [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=93.36s)]
*  in 12 years the whole world's going to end because the environment is obviously not true. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=96.72s)]
*  Or there is no future because every party says the other party is going to destroy the world, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=101.44s)]
*  destroy the country. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=105.6s)]
*  People without a vision just have no direction. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=106.88s)]
*  And so it's up to us to become more emotionally fit. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=109.2s)]
*  And by the way, this is not new. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=111.84s)]
*  That's wise. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=113.2s)]
*  Everybody, thank you, but everybody who studies history knows things happen in cycles. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=114.48s)]
*  And as the most simplified version, a couple of years ago, you and I talked about this real [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=120.0s)]
*  briefly, but think of it this way. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  Man transformed, humanity transformed from survival hunting and gathering to actually [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=125.84s)]
*  having a community by figuring one pattern recognition, which was seasons. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=130.72s)]
*  When you recognize the seasons, you're not panicked. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=134.72s)]
*  You're not freaked out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=136.96s)]
*  Why is it getting so cold? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=137.76s)]
*  And if you understand the seasons, you know I don't have to hunt and gather. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=138.96s)]
*  I can plant in the spring, but if I plant in the winter and work very hard, I get nothing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=142.08s)]
*  I have to do the right thing at the right time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  So we have to become aware of what season we're in. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=148.72000000000003s)]
*  So springtime in a person's life, springtime in an economy is easy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=150.56s)]
*  I've got a little two and a half year old. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  I've got five kids and five grandkids. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=156.96s)]
*  So I've got a 48 year old daughter and I've got a two and a half year old daughter. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  So I've got the whole range. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=161.12s)]
*  Speaking of seasons. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=162.4s)]
*  Speaking of seasons. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=163.44s)]
*  But if you look at my daughter, she's learning Chinese, Spanish, English. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=164.56s)]
*  She's playing the piano. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=168.8s)]
*  She's doing all these fun things. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=170.4s)]
*  The two and a half learning is the easiest thing in the world. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=171.44s)]
*  When you're in a springtime economy, you think you're a genius with your business. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  It grows because everything's growing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Right. That's right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=179.44s)]
*  But life is always good times, challenging times that make us grow. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=180.24s)]
*  So then we have a summer. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=184.08s)]
*  Summer is always more challenging. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=184.96s)]
*  It's hot and difficult and you got to push through. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=186.0s)]
*  What was growing real easy is not so easy to do anymore. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=188.88s)]
*  People start to panic. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=191.76s)]
*  But if you stay strong and you keep pushing forward and keep growing, you get to go to the fall. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  Another easy season, a beautiful season. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=197.44s)]
*  Now people want to loan you money and give you a house even though you don't have an income. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=199.52s)]
*  You remember those days. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. Very well. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=203.44s)]
*  There's easy money. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  Stock markets go crazy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=205.52s)]
*  These seasons last about 18 to 20 years. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  They go every 80 year like cycles. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  You can see them in a thousand years of history. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  And let's say Roman history, about 100 year cycles, 25 years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  Now they're 18, 20 year cycles. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  But what follows the winter, what follows, I should say, the reaping time is the winter. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  Some winters are long. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=222.96s)]
*  Some are short. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=224.08s)]
*  Some are hard. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=224.96s)]
*  Some are easy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=225.44s)]
*  But you never go from reaping straight to spring. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=226.0s)]
*  And we're in winter right now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=228.56s)]
*  Depending on who you study historically, we're halfway, two-thirds way through it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=230.88s)]
*  Where there's challenges economically, where there's tremendous fear. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=234.4s)]
*  Each season has a different emotion until we exhaust it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=237.6s)]
*  Even optimism. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=240.16s)]
*  You ever smile so much your face hurt? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=240.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=242.56s)]
*  So that's what it's like in springtime. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=243.28s)]
*  Summertime, there's inner conflict within the country. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=245.28s)]
*  Fall, everybody's reaping again. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=248.24s)]
*  Not everybody, but certain people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=249.68s)]
*  Winter, it looks like it's never going to happen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=251.36s)]
*  It looks like, here's the truth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=253.36s)]
*  No war lasts forever. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=255.28s)]
*  No pandemic lasts forever. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=256.88s)]
*  No economy lasts forever. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=258.4s)]
*  And what, if you were God, if you were the universe, how would you set up? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  After the really rough night, you'd have a great day. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=262.88s)]
*  And that's pretty much the season. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=265.44s)]
*  So we're in winter, and we have to retool ourselves for this time. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=266.64s)]
*  Because right now, people have more fear. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=269.76s)]
*  It's exaggerated. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=272.23999999999995s)]
*  And the media helped. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=273.28s)]
*  The media is not bad people, as you well know. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=274.96s)]
*  It's good people doing their job. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=277.12s)]
*  Their job is take care of their shareholders. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=278.32s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=280.32s)]
*  You get attention. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=281.12s)]
*  How do you get attention? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=282.08s)]
*  Fear and anger get it more than anything else. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=283.52s)]
*  That's why we have clickbait. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=285.44s)]
*  The minute you click on it, even though it's not true, the group gets paid. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=286.72s)]
*  So we live in a world where fear sells. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=290.32s)]
*  And we're being hit on it everywhere. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=293.76s)]
*  You don't have to go get it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  It comes to your pocket. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=296.08s)]
*  So we have to rewire ourselves. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=297.2s)]
*  It's like if I said to you, take your car and go on a 24-hour Le Mans ride. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=298.4s)]
*  You could have a really nice Mercedes, Ferrari, whatever you think it is. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=302.32s)]
*  It's not going to last. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=304.96s)]
*  You've got to retool it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=305.6s)]
*  Or there's desert races, 1,000 miles. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=306.56s)]
*  If you don't have the right sprockets in there, if you don't have something that, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=309.2s)]
*  when you drop down to the sand, can still bring the air into the car, you're not there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=312.32s)]
*  So my view is you've got to retool yourself. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=315.76s)]
*  You've got to train yourself this time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=318.32s)]
*  And you also have to know it's not forever. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=319.76s)]
*  The other side of this is going to be a new springtime. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  But we're going to have to go through some challenges first. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=323.92s)]
*  And they could be severe. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=325.68s)]
*  And most of these extended winters, we've had some kind of war. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=326.56s)]
*  This case might be a cyber war with China or something of that nature. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=330.88s)]
*  But there is another side. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=333.68s)]
*  And it requires faith and determination to move forward. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=335.12s)]
*  And it requires you focus on what you can control versus what you can't. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=341.12s)]
*  A friend of mine was saying the other day, oh my God, you know, it's really smart. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=341.84s)]
*  A very successful man. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=346.32s)]
*  I've known him for 35 years. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=347.68s)]
*  I've coached him and I get coached by him. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=349.04s)]
*  We've got a pitch and catch with each other. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=351.04s)]
*  And he's saying, I'm so worried. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=353.36s)]
*  He's also Jewish. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=354.32s)]
*  And he's like, you see what's happening in the world? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=354.96s)]
*  And what if somebody drops a nuclear bomb? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=356.64s)]
*  And I said, you taught me years ago. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  He taught me. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=360.32s)]
*  Don't ever look at the worst case scenario. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=361.36s)]
*  Because if that happens, we're all screwed. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=363.04s)]
*  And it doesn't matter. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=364.4s)]
*  We'll have to figure it out. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  I said, if somebody drops a nuclear bomb, you won't even know you'll be vaporized. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=366.08s)]
*  So living around in fear about it's not it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=369.04s)]
*  Let's focus on what we can control. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=371.2s)]
*  Let's focus on what is here. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=372.64s)]
*  And then you start to build. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=374.32s)]
*  And so I really think that people need to build a path from where they are to where they want to be. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's really my focus in helping people to do that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  What a wonderful explanation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=384.96s)]
*  So you don't think, I mean, you think winter is inevitable if I'm wrong. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=386.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=390.8s)]
*  Because it always is. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=391.36s)]
*  And it always follows good times. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=392.24s)]
*  But it's not the end. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=394.56s)]
*  No. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=397.36s)]
*  And when things are going bad, they think it's going to be bad forever. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=397.52s)]
*  When it's going good, people think it's going to be good forever. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=399.36s)]
*  Life is cyclical. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=401.12s)]
*  What's the upside of winter? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=402.08s)]
*  Well, if you don't whine about and complain about it, you get strong. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=404.08s)]
*  When I started my business, it was 18% interest rates. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=407.76s)]
*  When I hear people today saying, I can't buy a house at 7% interest rates. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=410.23999999999995s)]
*  I think today it was 18% interest rates. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=413.76s)]
*  People will be sacking the White House. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=416.0s)]
*  You know, people have such a different expectation. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=417.28s)]
*  But it made me incredibly strong. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=419.67999999999995s)]
*  I was in the middle of stagflation. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=421.28s)]
*  All those things that were starting to consider may happen again. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=422.64s)]
*  I went through all those things, but it made me strong. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  And I've had dozens and dozens of people come and go in my industry. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=427.44s)]
*  And here I am. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=430.47999999999996s)]
*  46 will be my 47th year coming up here. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=431.44s)]
*  I started when I was three. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=433.76s)]
*  But in 47 years, I'd be an idiot not to see patterns. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=436.0s)]
*  Patterns that control how we think, how we feel, what we do, the results we get. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=439.04s)]
*  There's macro patterns in the world and there's micro patterns inside of you. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=442.56s)]
*  You don't get angry every moment. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=446.56s)]
*  You get angry certain times. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=447.92s)]
*  You don't overeat every moment. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=448.88s)]
*  Only we get triggered certain ways. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=450.24s)]
*  So showing people how to create a path from where they are, where they want to be, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=452.0s)]
*  regardless of the outside world, to me is the most important thing. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=455.2s)]
*  And there's joy in winters, maybe different kinds. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=458.4s)]
*  Well, you can snowboard. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=460.56s)]
*  Some people freeze to death. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=463.6s)]
*  Other people snowboard. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=464.64s)]
*  Some people have more time with their family. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=465.52s)]
*  Some people get together and say, hey, it's time to really redevelop my career, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=467.68s)]
*  maybe retool myself right now for what's coming so I can take advantage. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=471.52s)]
*  Because AI and robotics and nanotechnology are all coming faster than people think. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=474.64s)]
*  It's going to massively disrupt some jobs. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=479.52s)]
*  There'll be new jobs, but you're going to have to retool for them, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=481.28s)]
*  or otherwise you'll be left behind. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=483.52s)]
*  I got to say, you're just reminding me that you mentioned COVID at the outset, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=485.36s)]
*  which was, I think, by any measure, no matter what side you're on, was a disaster. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=489.04s)]
*  But it was also, for some people, some small percentage of us, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=493.36s)]
*  a really, really happy time. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=496.24s)]
*  I'll speak for myself. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=497.6s)]
*  It was one of the happiest times of my whole life. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=498.72s)]
*  Oh, that's beautiful. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  Because I got to be with my family. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=500.88s)]
*  Well, I had a similar experience. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  I've lived 275 days on the road since I was 17 years old, traveling 30 countries a year. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  And suddenly, I'm getting calls from Gavin Newsom's office saying, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=509.76s)]
*  guess what, your convention here, the stadium with 15,000 people, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=513.84s)]
*  100 people in the stadium. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=517.92s)]
*  I'm like, how's that going to work? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  It's not worth the airfare. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=520.64s)]
*  Not going to happen. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=521.52s)]
*  So I said, we'll go to Vegas. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=522.24s)]
*  We'll move to Vegas. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=523.36s)]
*  They'll never shut down Vegas. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  One week out, with 12,500 people, they shut down Vegas. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  Then I said, we'll go to Texas. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=528.88s)]
*  The governor there, he's tough. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  He won't shut down, he said. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=531.28s)]
*  Yeah, he's tough. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  He shut down. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=533.28s)]
*  Of course he did. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=533.92s)]
*  Theaters, we opened all these theaters. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=534.64s)]
*  We'll put 10 people in each theater. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  We'll do 1,300 theaters. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=537.52s)]
*  We'll have 13,000 people to work out. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=539.68s)]
*  At least have a group and a small group of people on big screens and music. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  And they shut down the theaters. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=545.52s)]
*  So I had to figure out how to serve people. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=547.52s)]
*  So the first thing I did was I built a studio, 25,000 square feet. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=549.6s)]
*  And I built these screens 20 feet high. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  And LED 0.67 is like, is it better than if you were not here in person? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=555.92s)]
*  Because you're bigger too. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=559.76s)]
*  And I can see all these people at once, swipe and see another group. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=561.04s)]
*  And so I grew my seminars from the 15,000 people to 40,000 people. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=564.32s)]
*  Because now I have people from 195 countries attending. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=568.64s)]
*  And they were in their homes. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=570.96s)]
*  And I didn't think I could convert that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=572.0s)]
*  But by bringing them on, I worked with the founder of Zoom. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=573.84s)]
*  And I made it so that we could bring people up on screen, not just 1,000, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=576.56s)]
*  but bring 25,000 and 30,000 and 40,000. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=579.76s)]
*  I made some software so when people, instead of clapping, they'd shake their phone, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=582.4s)]
*  sends an electric signal. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=586.16s)]
*  So if one person you don't hear about, 25,000, 30,000, it shakes the building. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=587.3599999999999s)]
*  So it's real. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  And so once I did that, and I did my biggest seminar, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=593.04s)]
*  it was a million and a half people last year for, what was it, for four days, three days. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=596.4s)]
*  And it was from 195 countries, every person in the world. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=601.8399999999999s)]
*  And people had such huge transformations. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=605.2s)]
*  I did it for free because people were stuck at home. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=607.76s)]
*  So I made that my tradition. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=610.0s)]
*  And I've done that now for four years in a row in January. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=611.2800000000001s)]
*  For free. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=613.5200000000001s)]
*  For free. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=614.24s)]
*  And just said, I don't want money. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=614.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't want time. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=615.6s)]
*  I don't want travel getting in your way. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=616.24s)]
*  And this year, I'm going to be one for three days. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm doing it January 25th through the 27th. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=619.44s)]
*  It's just two and a half to three hours a day. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=621.84s)]
*  Instead of going to a movie, come with me at two o'clock in the afternoon Eastern. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  But I have people from 195 countries attending. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=628.08s)]
*  So they'll have a pathway. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=630.88s)]
*  And what I mean by a pathway is this. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  What we're being called to by all these problems is you let the sadness or [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=635.2s)]
*  depression or fear overwhelm you or anger. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=638.96s)]
*  You're going to make no progress. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  It'll blow you up. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  But you need to understand that all this disruption is a call. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=644.4000000000001s)]
*  You went through a call when Fox made a change with you. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=647.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=650.4000000000001s)]
*  A call is something disrupts your life. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=650.88s)]
*  This is the hero's journey, right? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  You look at all the stories of mankind and you look back and you see there's [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  this same path and you can make it really complex. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=657.0400000000001s)]
*  I like a simpler version. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=659.36s)]
*  First simple version is your life is seeming good or bad and then something [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=660.48s)]
*  disrupts it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=664.16s)]
*  You go through a divorce. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=665.1999999999999s)]
*  You suddenly have a health problem. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=666.56s)]
*  Somebody in your family has a health problem. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=667.8399999999999s)]
*  There's a you lose your job or something happens to the economy or COVID or [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=669.36s)]
*  whatever. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=673.4399999999999s)]
*  Doesn't have to be within your control. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=673.76s)]
*  And what does that require? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=675.36s)]
*  It means you've got to be called on a new adventure. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=676.4s)]
*  It makes you get out of your comfort zone. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=679.52s)]
*  That's where we are right now. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=680.9599999999999s)]
*  You either fall back and freak out or you discipline your disappointment and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=682.0s)]
*  you move forward. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=685.92s)]
*  And what happens? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=686.56s)]
*  You go on a journey and on that journey, you're going to face all kinds of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=687.28s)]
*  demons and challenge and dragons. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=690.48s)]
*  You're going to meet some new mentors. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=692.24s)]
*  You're going to develop some new skills. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=693.84s)]
*  And if you do the hard work and push through, you'll make the decide you'll [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=695.44s)]
*  be transformed. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  You'll be the hero of your own life and you can bring back what you've learned [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=699.44s)]
*  and help other people. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=701.84s)]
*  And it's not that hard. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=702.96s)]
*  I mean, I'll give you seven steps real fast. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=703.9200000000001s)]
*  I'll get a members of the first four because the other three kind of take care [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  of themselves. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  Step one, what's make somebody go on a journey is when they unleash or awaken [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=709.6800000000001s)]
*  their deeper desires. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=713.6s)]
*  So for you, and I don't know for sure, but my bet is the Fox situation was [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  disruptive, but it also unleashed within you new possibilities. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=720.0s)]
*  I could do this on my own terms. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=723.76s)]
*  I could do things more international. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=724.88s)]
*  I'm not going to be limited with someone else tells me I can or cannot do. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=726.16s)]
*  And I know you weren't limited very much before, but you have total freedom now [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=729.44s)]
*  to do it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=732.16s)]
*  But as you go on that journey, you got to build a business. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=732.72s)]
*  You used to work for someone else. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=735.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=736.64s)]
*  And you got to bring people in and they're not all going to perform. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=736.88s)]
*  And then you discover some people you've been so loyal to are not quite as [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=739.28s)]
*  committed as you are. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=742.0s)]
*  They're not doing the job and you have to take on things you probably didn't [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=742.96s)]
*  want to take on. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=745.52s)]
*  You're spending your time looking at the big issues and dealing with things. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=746.64s)]
*  But at some level, you got to deal with the business. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=750.0s)]
*  And so along the way, you'll have to deal with those challenges. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=751.44s)]
*  You'll find new people. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=753.92s)]
*  You'll find new mentors. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=755.2s)]
*  You'll develop new skills. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=756.48s)]
*  And the other side, you'll be better off than ever before and be able to come [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=758.0s)]
*  back and help more people. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=760.4s)]
*  But you have to know what is it you want and why do you want it? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=761.68s)]
*  Because it's like New Year's resolutions. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=765.12s)]
*  Why don't they work? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=766.56s)]
*  Because you don't need a resolution. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=768.0s)]
*  You're just saying what you want to have happen. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=770.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=772.48s)]
*  It's not really a resolution. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=773.04s)]
*  When you resolve something, that means you cut off anything except what you've [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=774.16s)]
*  committed to. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=777.68s)]
*  People don't resolve. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=778.32s)]
*  They go, I kind of like this. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=778.96s)]
*  Most people don't have much of a plan. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  But if you know what you want with real clarity and why you want it, now you're [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=782.08s)]
*  on the path. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=786.6400000000001s)]
*  So for example, someone says, how do I know I'm going to get where I want to be [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=787.36s)]
*  financially? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=790.48s)]
*  How do I know where I want to be in a relationship or in my business or career? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=790.96s)]
*  First step is what do you want? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=794.6400000000001s)]
*  If you don't know what you want, you're not even on the path. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  If you know exactly what you want, get really clear and you know why you want it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=798.08s)]
*  You got enough reasons to push you through. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=801.12s)]
*  Now the second step is you got to find and face the truth. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=803.2s)]
*  And that's what has to happen for everybody. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  Find and face the truth means see the gap between where you are and where you want [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=808.3199999999999s)]
*  to be. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=812.0799999999999s)]
*  There's always a gap, if you're honest. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=812.48s)]
*  So instead of, well, I'm big boned is what I used to tell myself when I was 38 [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=814.24s)]
*  pounds heavier. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=818.0799999999999s)]
*  No, I was fricking fat. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  That's what I was, right? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  But I'd say I was big boned. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=821.28s)]
*  I have the same bones, then I'm 38 pounds lighter and stayed this way for 35 years. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=822.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=825.6s)]
*  But when I had that mindset, you got in the way. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=825.92s)]
*  So you have to say, here's where I am, here's where I want to be, and you have [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  to be honest. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=829.8399999999999s)]
*  It's not where I want to be. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=831.12s)]
*  It's uncomfortable. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  But then the second part is you got to uncover, face the truth, what has gotten [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=833.28s)]
*  in the way in the past. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=836.48s)]
*  And there's only five things usually. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=838.08s)]
*  Fear, fear of failure, fear of success, fear of unknown, fear of not looking good, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=839.6800000000001s)]
*  fear of all those things. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=843.6800000000001s)]
*  Or two, a limiting belief. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=845.2s)]
*  I've tried everything. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=848.24s)]
*  Once you believe that, you don't even try anything anymore. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=849.2s)]
*  Someone trying to lose weight, that's the common one they'll say because they've [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=851.52s)]
*  tried a bunch of things that didn't work. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=854.0s)]
*  Or all the good ones are gone. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=855.36s)]
*  Or they're gay and I'm not, or I'm gay and they're not, or whatever the story is. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=859.12s)]
*  There's a story, a belief system that limits them. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=861.76s)]
*  And so it keeps them from maximizing their ability. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=864.08s)]
*  Third thing that could have gotten in the way, some other emotion, overwhelm, stress, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=866.4s)]
*  anger, resentment. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=871.04s)]
*  Those things just shut down your progress. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=872.24s)]
*  So you have to make a change. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=874.72s)]
*  Fourth thing that it could be for you, well, it could really be that you just got [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=876.16s)]
*  some bad habits. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=879.52s)]
*  It's like people, about 52% of what most people do in a day, and I don't know where [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  they come up with these stats. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=884.72s)]
*  Some say 48, some say 52, roughly half, is automated. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=885.52s)]
*  It's habit. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=889.6s)]
*  You're not even thinking, right? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=891.12s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  And what's good about that is you don't think about driving your car. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=893.04s)]
*  What's bad about that is you get stuck doing the same things over and over, thinking [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=895.92s)]
*  the same thoughts, having the same feelings, not really changing. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=899.28s)]
*  So you have to say, oh, there's some habits that need to change. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=902.4799999999999s)]
*  I want to lose 24 pounds and my first thing in the morning is go to Starbucks and have [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=905.36s)]
*  a mocha smoke or whatever. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=909.8399999999999s)]
*  And it's just, you're not going to get there. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=910.88s)]
*  You have to have a different set of habits. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=912.9599999999999s)]
*  And then the fifth one is, or were you missing a skill? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=914.24s)]
*  Like, for example, some people don't know what to do financially. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=917.5999999999999s)]
*  They don't have to invest and so they don't do anything. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=919.8399999999999s)]
*  And then you wake up figuring out, why am I so broke? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=921.52s)]
*  You're broke because you're a consumer. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=924.96s)]
*  You're not an owner. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  So you have to look at what skill do you need to get? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=927.7600000000001s)]
*  Is there a skill for running your business? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=930.6400000000001s)]
*  When I started my business, I had no skills. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=932.6400000000001s)]
*  I had passion. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=934.96s)]
*  I had desire. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=935.9200000000001s)]
*  I had hunger. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=936.72s)]
*  I had great abilities, but I didn't know how to run a business. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=937.36s)]
*  So I learned those skills. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=940.48s)]
*  Now I've got 114 companies. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=941.6800000000001s)]
*  We do $7 billion in business across all kinds of different industries you can imagine. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=943.9200000000001s)]
*  It's like it's the most fun thing in the world because I know how to do it. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=948.48s)]
*  So if you know what you really want and you face the truth and find the real truth, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=951.36s)]
*  then you've got to put a massive action plan together. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=955.92s)]
*  And that just means not a perfect plan, but just what are some things you do [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=958.0s)]
*  immediately start making progress? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=961.36s)]
*  Because as you make progress, new insights will come to you. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=962.72s)]
*  And then the fourth one, and I'll finish with that, the others are quick, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=965.36s)]
*  is just you have to then do the hard work. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=968.24s)]
*  You got to slay your dragons. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=971.12s)]
*  You got to slay that limiting belief or that anger or that hurt or that sadness. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=972.8s)]
*  You got to create that compelling future. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=976.24s)]
*  You got to go get that skill. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=977.8399999999999s)]
*  And then after those first four steps, you'll have momentum. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=979.44s)]
*  Now you just need a daily practice, something that puts you in the place [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=981.6800000000001s)]
*  of doing the right thing each day. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=984.8000000000001s)]
*  So it becomes a habit. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=986.1600000000001s)]
*  You need to measure. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=987.44s)]
*  Measure more often. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=988.8800000000001s)]
*  When I take over a company, the first thing I do is measure more often. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  And I find the things that matter and I'll measure them not once a year. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=992.48s)]
*  Then you have a bad year. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=995.2800000000001s)]
*  Measure once a month, you're not going to have bad years. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=996.4000000000001s)]
*  You got 12 times to make it better. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=998.1600000000001s)]
*  Measure it once a week, you won't have bad months. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=999.5200000000001s)]
*  Measure it once a day. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1001.7600000000001s)]
*  And some companies when I take over, I'll measure some things three or four times a day [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1002.8000000000001s)]
*  because where focus goes, energy flows. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1005.5200000000001s)]
*  And so now all of a sudden you're measuring and improving. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1008.08s)]
*  You can do any daily practice, you'll then get to a point where you can celebrate. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1010.64s)]
*  And once you celebrate, it starts all over again because you'll be called on another journey [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1013.6800000000001s)]
*  because we're meant to grow. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1017.44s)]
*  If you ask people ask me, what does it take to be happy? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  You met millions of people. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1021.44s)]
*  What does it take? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1022.48s)]
*  So many people are unhappy. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1023.36s)]
*  Well, relationships are one of the keys to that. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1025.04s)]
*  But there is one key even within relationship, progress. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1026.96s)]
*  Progress equals happiness. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1030.8s)]
*  If you go and achieve some huge goal, I don't know if you've ever done this, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1032.56s)]
*  and then you achieve it, you have one or two experiences. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1035.76s)]
*  You either go, is this all there is after you achieve it, which is horrible, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1037.44s)]
*  feels worse than failing. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1041.52s)]
*  Or you go, wow, this is amazing. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  And you celebrate. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1045.3600000000001s)]
*  But how long do you feel good for after achieving some great goal? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1046.64s)]
*  Five years, a year, six months, 60 days. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1050.0s)]
*  20 or 30 minutes. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1054.3200000000002s)]
*  20 or 30 minutes. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1055.28s)]
*  In that range. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1056.0800000000002s)]
*  That's the- [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1056.8s)]
*  Most people are in the 20 to 30 minutes to maybe two months max. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1057.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1060.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1061.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1062.3200000000002s)]
*  Because we're not meant to just sit at the table of success and get fat and feel bored. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1062.96s)]
*  We're meant to grow. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1067.12s)]
*  And when we grow, we make progress, we feel alive. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  And what makes us feel most alive, I know in your life and in mine too, knowing you as a person, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1071.12s)]
*  is when you grow, you have something to give. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1075.6799999999998s)]
*  And what makes life meaningful is not just a happy life, it's not always happy, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1077.9199999999998s)]
*  but a meaningful life is a life where you serve something more than yourself. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1081.12s)]
*  Something that gives you the energy and excitement, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1084.0s)]
*  whether it be serving your kids and family or your business [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1085.9199999999998s)]
*  or something in your community or something in the world. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1089.04s)]
*  That's what makes it work. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1091.36s)]
*  But we all need you on the path. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1092.1599999999999s)]
*  And you can do this within the air. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1093.28s)]
*  Where are you unhappy about? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1094.32s)]
*  My body. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1095.28s)]
*  Well, first step, do you know exactly what you want and why you want it? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1095.76s)]
*  Okay, let's start there. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1098.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1099.92s)]
*  Second, you know what you want, why you want it? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1100.32s)]
*  Tell me, have you faced the truth? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1102.08s)]
*  How big a gap is it specifically? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1103.68s)]
*  How far off are you? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1105.92s)]
*  Let's measure it. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1107.04s)]
*  And then what's gotten in the way? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1108.08s)]
*  Is it fear? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1109.84s)]
*  Is it limiting beliefs? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1111.2s)]
*  Is it some form of emotion that gets in the way? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  Frustration, anger, overwhelm? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1115.68s)]
*  Is it some kind of habit you got or is there a skill you need to get? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1117.6s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1120.96s)]
*  Let's get a plan and let's go do the hard work. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1121.44s)]
*  Those first four things will get anybody going. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1124.0s)]
*  Once you do, you get the momentum that makes you successful. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1125.68s)]
*  Among the things that scare people, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1129.36s)]
*  maybe the top thing that scares people right now is going broke, as I said. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1132.88s)]
*  And the US economy feels unstable or squirrely or hard to understand, if nothing else. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1137.68s)]
*  And most people, myself included, just don't have the skills to start 114 companies. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1143.2s)]
*  They're just not good at it. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1147.28s)]
*  Nor did I. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1148.88s)]
*  But I would say at least I'll speak for myself, I'm never going to have those skills. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1149.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1152.8s)]
*  So that's not an avenue that's open to some people, maybe most people. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1154.16s)]
*  And so how do you know what you just have a book out, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1158.24s)]
*  Holy Grail of Investing, in which you talk to people who've been successful in investing, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1162.64s)]
*  very successful. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1166.24s)]
*  But if you could just lower the bar a little bit for the average person [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  who doesn't have a ton of money to invest, who's really worried about what's coming, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1170.8s)]
*  what would you recommend? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1174.8s)]
*  Before I even talk about investment, the most important one is understanding [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1176.0800000000002s)]
*  what allows someone to have abundance in their life. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1180.0800000000002s)]
*  And I grew up dirt poor, I think you know, and I had four different fathers, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1182.96s)]
*  and they were good men. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1186.56s)]
*  And we had no money and no food. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1187.76s)]
*  And the reason, you know, I know, you know, I don't know if I told you, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1189.2s)]
*  but two years ago, I think I last saw you, and we've now completed the billion meals challenge. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1191.8400000000001s)]
*  I decided I want to feed a billion meals, and we did it two years early. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1196.48s)]
*  We just completed it last year. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1199.76s)]
*  Now I'm doing a hundred billion meal challenge. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1200.8s)]
*  But why? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1202.48s)]
*  Not because I'm such a good person, because I grew up poor, we had no food. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1202.88s)]
*  And so I look back at those days and go, why were my father's good men? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1206.0s)]
*  Why were we broke no matter what? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1209.8400000000001s)]
*  Good times are bad. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1211.84s)]
*  And why did they lose their jobs at various times? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1213.28s)]
*  And my original teacher is a man named Jim Rohn. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1215.6799999999998s)]
*  He was a personal development, kind of a business philosopher. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1217.6799999999998s)]
*  And one day I sat down with him and I said, I got to ask you a burning question. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1220.48s)]
*  Like, how is it so unjust that here's a teacher who can barely survive, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1223.76s)]
*  and then this hedge fund manager over here makes a billion dollars a year? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1227.84s)]
*  And he said, Tony, that's a good question. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1231.6799999999998s)]
*  He said, think of it this way. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1233.6799999999998s)]
*  We're all equal as souls, but we're not equal in the marketplace. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1235.4399999999998s)]
*  So what do you mean? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1239.52s)]
*  He said, well, I'm not being negative, but if somebody works for McDonald's, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1240.48s)]
*  that's not designed to be your long term job. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1244.0800000000002s)]
*  It's designed to get you a starter job and it doesn't pay very much [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1246.4s)]
*  because anyone can do it. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1249.52s)]
*  Today, they got pictures. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1251.0400000000002s)]
*  You don't even have to speak the language 100%. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1252.24s)]
*  And you can do that job and learn it within a few hours. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1254.24s)]
*  So it's not very valuable. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1256.3200000000002s)]
*  So it doesn't make a lot. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1258.16s)]
*  In fact, now it'll be replaced by machines. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1259.0400000000002s)]
*  Lots of companies are working on that now in the fast food industry. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1260.8000000000002s)]
*  So there's not a lot of value. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1263.52s)]
*  Now, the guy that did the billion dollars that you have judged about, Tony, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1265.2800000000002s)]
*  he said, those teachers you're talking about, some are great. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1269.04s)]
*  I'm sure you've had some great ones. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1271.28s)]
*  Some are not so great. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1272.24s)]
*  And he said, and there's no standard and there's a limited number of people they affect. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1273.68s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1277.36s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1278.1599999999999s)]
*  This guy that made a billion dollars made 25 billion dollars for his investors, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1279.2s)]
*  which include people's pensions, their backgrounds. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1283.6s)]
*  When other people are making four and 5%, he made 38%. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1286.0s)]
*  So they're doubling their money every two and a half, three years [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1290.24s)]
*  versus doubling their money, let's say every 10 or 12. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1293.04s)]
*  So he's adding massive value. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1296.24s)]
*  I'm not saying you need to be one of those people, but what you do need to do is what's [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1298.16s)]
*  missing in our culture. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1301.68s)]
*  Everybody's trying to figure out what am I going to get from the government? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  What am I going to work support? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1305.68s)]
*  Why isn't things that I want looking at the system instead of myself? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1306.96s)]
*  And he said, instead, do more work harder on yourself than you do your job. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1310.48s)]
*  Find a way to become more valuable than anybody else in the marketplace. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1314.8000000000002s)]
*  And if you continually do more for others, if your focus is how can I do more for others [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1318.48s)]
*  than anybody else, you'll win. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1322.3200000000002s)]
*  That formula I got at 19 years old and I've lived it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1324.48s)]
*  It felt real to me, I mean, the way I kind of live anyway, but I made that the basis [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1328.24s)]
*  of every company I've ever built. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1332.56s)]
*  And so the companies have become successful because everybody in that culture is how do [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1333.84s)]
*  we do more for anybody else in the industry? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1337.84s)]
*  And you do that over and over for years, you build a brand and then people seek you out [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1339.36s)]
*  and you succeed. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1342.72s)]
*  So the first thing is what can I do to become more valuable in the marketplace? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1343.68s)]
*  Oh, they asked Warren Buffett the other day, they asked him, how do you feel about inflation [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1348.08s)]
*  and what should we do about inflation? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1352.32s)]
*  And I remember when I interviewed him, I asked him what was the best investment you could [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1353.92s)]
*  ever make and the best investment he'd ever make. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1356.8799999999999s)]
*  And I thought he'd say Coca-Cola or, you know, Geico, I know the companies invested in. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1358.72s)]
*  He goes, Tony, it's what you teach. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1362.8s)]
*  I said, well, I teach a lot of things, which one? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1364.24s)]
*  And he said, well, he said, I have all these ideas, but they would have died on my lips, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1366.0s)]
*  but I learned how to communicate. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1370.4s)]
*  He went through Dale Carnegie. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1371.52s)]
*  He said that skill was the most valuable skill. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1373.2s)]
*  And he said, I tell people if you want to do well in inflation and inflation is 8%, 5%, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1375.76s)]
*  all you got to do is be 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20% more effective, more productive. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1380.72s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1385.6799999999998s)]
*  You invest in yourself. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1386.32s)]
*  He said, that's the first investment you do. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1387.28s)]
*  No one can tax it and it grows. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1389.1999999999998s)]
*  If the dollar goes down and we go to shekels, if you're a great doctor, you're a great, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1391.1999999999998s)]
*  you know, web designer, you're a great whatever, you will be paid extremely well, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1395.52s)]
*  but you have to be focused on adding value and you've got to become more valuable yourself. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1400.0s)]
*  So that's where it starts. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1404.08s)]
*  Second step. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1405.9199999999998s)]
*  I've written three number one bestsellers and two of them, the last two were financial ones. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1406.96s)]
*  This would be my final third one in the trilogy. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1411.1200000000001s)]
*  And the first one I interviewed 50 of the most successful financial people in the world, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1413.6000000000001s)]
*  the Ray Dalios, the Warren Buffetts, the Carl Icahons, to find out what do they do different [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1416.8s)]
*  and to find out is the game winnable? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1420.8s)]
*  Because after 2008, it feels like the game is rigged against people. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1422.32s)]
*  The game winnable, exactly. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1425.92s)]
*  And so I went out and I thought I can ask some journalists that. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1427.28s)]
*  They'll tell me their point of view. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1430.16s)]
*  That's great. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  Let me talk to people that started with nothing [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1431.8400000000001s)]
*  and have become the most successful in the world in their section, in their business. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  So I got a chance to have access to those people and one led to another. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1437.44s)]
*  Wow, it was a four and a half year journey. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1441.1200000000001s)]
*  And I wrote Money Master the Game out of that. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1443.3600000000001s)]
*  I was able to show, yeah, you absolutely can win the game. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1445.1200000000001s)]
*  First step, answer your earlier question. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1447.44s)]
*  You've got to start becoming an owner instead of being a consumer. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1449.92s)]
*  Our entire society makes you a consumer. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1453.28s)]
*  So you buy an Apple phone every year, two or three, but you don't want Apple stock. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1455.68s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1460.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1461.68s)]
*  The most, only way you're going to become wealthy is either start a business [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1462.08s)]
*  or become an owner of businesses. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1466.32s)]
*  You don't have to be a great entrepreneur then. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1469.4399999999998s)]
*  You just have to invest in some smart people in that area. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1471.2s)]
*  And so the process of learning how to do that by just doing two things, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1473.6s)]
*  taking a percentage of what you earn, no matter how little it is, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1477.12s)]
*  and locking and automating that to go in an account where you don't see it. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1480.08s)]
*  That's the first discipline. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1483.36s)]
*  There's a guy I wrote about in my first book, Theodore Johnson, worked for UPS. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1484.8799999999999s)]
*  Never made more than $14,000 in a single year, retired with $70 million. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1488.6399999999999s)]
*  He was a driver. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1494.08s)]
*  Everybody loved him. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1495.28s)]
*  He lived in everybody's state. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1496.24s)]
*  If he was sick, where is Theodore? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1497.44s)]
*  But a friend of his said, we're going to take 20% of what you earn [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1499.36s)]
*  and we're going to make you wealthy. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1502.24s)]
*  I'm going to tax you 20%. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1503.36s)]
*  He said, I can't live in 14,000. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1504.72s)]
*  He goes, we're going to automate it. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1506.3999999999999s)]
*  It's going to disappear. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1507.84s)]
*  You're going to adjust. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1508.96s)]
*  But that money is going to be your future. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1510.0s)]
*  That money compounded through just investments in the stock market and UPS to 70 million. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1512.16s)]
*  He gave away 35 million while he was alive. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1516.48s)]
*  So you don't have to be a superstar business person. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1518.16s)]
*  You got to be an owner. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1520.56s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1521.52s)]
*  Two, I wrote Unshakeable because I knew, I didn't know when, nobody knows when. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1522.56s)]
*  Obviously, the markets are going to crash. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1526.48s)]
*  Obviously, there's going to be a crash as there was in 2020. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1528.0s)]
*  I wrote it before that. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1530.1599999999999s)]
*  And I just showed people how to be unshakeable that time, how to win during that time. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1531.36s)]
*  This book, though, I got really excited because when I wrote those first two books, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1535.76s)]
*  I learned four things that every great investor does. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1541.12s)]
*  Really, I'd like Ray Dalio is a macro investor. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1544.0s)]
*  Somebody else might be a value investor like Warren Buffett. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1547.44s)]
*  There's all different types of investors. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1550.96s)]
*  They all, 50 of them, agreed on four things. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1553.04s)]
*  First, this sounds stupid. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1555.6799999999998s)]
*  They're all obsessed with not losing money, which is the opposite of most investors. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1557.44s)]
*  We're trying to figure out how to make money because they know if I lose 50% on a stock, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1561.04s)]
*  I don't need to make 50% to get even. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1566.0s)]
*  I'm going to make 100%. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1567.52s)]
*  Had 100,000, it drops to 50. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1569.2s)]
*  I can't just go up 50%. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1571.76s)]
*  I got to go up a little higher than that to get back there. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1573.36s)]
*  So they're obsessed with that. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1575.6s)]
*  But how do you do that? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1576.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, Warren Buffett has a philosophy. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1578.1599999999999s)]
*  He says rule number one, investing, don't lose money. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1580.0s)]
*  Rule number two, see rule number one. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1582.24s)]
*  Well, that sounds really nice. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1583.52s)]
*  How the hell are you going to do that? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1584.56s)]
*  Second principle. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1586.08s)]
*  They all agreed on something that sounds complex. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1587.04s)]
*  The most important part of your investment future, you don't have to be a genius, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1589.92s)]
*  is what's called asset allocation. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1593.92s)]
*  Big words. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1595.52s)]
*  All it means is you have a certain amount of money to invest. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1596.48s)]
*  $1,000, $1 million, doesn't matter. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1598.8s)]
*  You have to have a pre-designed way you're going to do that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1601.04s)]
*  It says, I'm going to take some of this, some percentage, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1603.6s)]
*  and put it in something that's secure, meaning low risk, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1607.52s)]
*  probably low return, but over time it'll compound. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1611.2s)]
*  It looks like grass growing until it's the tortoise in the hair. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1614.64s)]
*  Another percentage of my money I want to put in areas that are more high risk, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1618.0800000000002s)]
*  potentially higher return. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1621.6000000000001s)]
*  But if I lose it all, I need to make sure my security bucket kind of takes care of me. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1623.28s)]
*  And so they laid this thing out. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1626.72s)]
*  Each one of them laid it out for me. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1628.0800000000002s)]
*  And they never bet the whole farm on one thing. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1629.8400000000001s)]
*  That's why they succeed. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1632.0s)]
*  Pretty simple. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1633.6000000000001s)]
*  Third, and I'm going to show you what I got in this book. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1634.8s)]
*  I blew my mind why I wrote this book in a second. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1637.52s)]
*  It relates to asset allocation. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1639.2s)]
*  Third principle was you got to look for what they call asymmetrical risk reward. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1640.8s)]
*  These words are so big. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1645.04s)]
*  All it means is where can I invest with the least amount of risk, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1646.8s)]
*  with the most amount of upside? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1650.48s)]
*  So if you look at really wealthy people, you think they take giant risks. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1652.3999999999999s)]
*  It may look like it. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1656.48s)]
*  Like, I don't know if you've met Richard Branson, but he's a friend of mine. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1657.2s)]
*  And Richard, he's risked his life in so many ways, going into space, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1660.08s)]
*  going across the ocean, going in balloons. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1663.84s)]
*  But if you look about how he invests, his whole thing is what's the downside? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1666.0s)]
*  How do we protect the downside? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1669.92s)]
*  How do we make this asymmetrical? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1671.68s)]
*  So when he decided to take on the fight with British Airways and start his own airways, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1672.96s)]
*  what was the biggest risk? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1679.76s)]
*  What do you think it would be? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1681.04s)]
*  I... government regulation? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1684.16s)]
*  The biggest risk is buying all those Boeing airplanes. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1687.68s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1690.48s)]
*  So you just assume, most people assume, well, I got to buy them and that's the risk. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1691.76s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1695.2s)]
*  He negotiated for a year and a half with Boeing [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1695.68s)]
*  to meet a deal that said, I'm going to buy all these planes. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1698.16s)]
*  But if within a year I can't make it work, I get to give all the planes back to you at no loss [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1701.44s)]
*  to me whatsoever. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1705.44s)]
*  He had nothing but upside, no downside. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1706.96s)]
*  That changes the way you feel day to day, right? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1709.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1711.92s)]
*  Paul Tudor Jones is one of the greatest investors in history. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  I've coached him for 24 years. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  Unbelievable guy. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1717.28s)]
*  He made back in 1987 when the stock market dropped 20% of the day, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1718.88s)]
*  still the largest percentage in the day. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1722.4s)]
*  He made people 100% that year. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1724.16s)]
*  He made more money than anybody can imagine. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1725.52s)]
*  Brilliant guy. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1727.2s)]
*  Coached him constantly. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1728.0s)]
*  His whole thing is I'm going to make an investment. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1729.28s)]
*  I want to risk a dollar, think I'm going to make five. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1730.88s)]
*  I might be wrong, but I don't want to invest until I feel like I got that kind of upside. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1732.64s)]
*  If I'm wrong, I can invest another dollar and I still can make four. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1735.76s)]
*  He can be wrong four times and still be okay. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1739.68s)]
*  So that idea is huge. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1742.32s)]
*  And then finally, one is diversification, which everybody knows. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1744.0s)]
*  Don't put all your eggs in one basket, one piece of real estate, one anything. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1746.64s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1750.32s)]
*  Those four are pretty useful. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1751.04s)]
*  I wrote this book called The Holy Grail of Investing because as I'm sitting down [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1752.72s)]
*  with Ray Dalio, one of the greatest investors in history, he has $195 billion that he manages [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1755.52s)]
*  for even countries and pension funds. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1761.68s)]
*  He's got the greatest returns ever. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1763.68s)]
*  In 2008, when things were down 35%, 38%, he made 8% to give you an idea. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1765.28s)]
*  Just genius. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1770.4s)]
*  Ray and I have become good friends over the last 13, 14 years. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1771.84s)]
*  One of the times when I first asked questions of him, I spent 10 hours preparing for what [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1774.48s)]
*  was supposed to be a 45-minute interview, which went for three hours. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1779.2s)]
*  And Ray was great because he goes, I get it. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1782.6399999999999s)]
*  We bounced off each other. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1784.56s)]
*  But one of the questions I asked him then was, what's the single most important investment [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1785.84s)]
*  principle if you knew nothing else that would make you successful? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1790.1599999999999s)]
*  He goes, Tony, I struggled with that for 22 years. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1793.44s)]
*  And I can tell you the answer. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1796.8799999999999s)]
*  He said, I call it the Holy Grail of Investing. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1797.76s)]
*  That's why the book's titled that. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1799.6799999999998s)]
*  It's after what Ray taught me. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1800.72s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1802.48s)]
*  I finally figured out that the biggest challenge is loss and risk. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1804.0s)]
*  Everybody wants upside, but to get more upside, take more risk. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1809.04s)]
*  It's not right for everybody. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1811.9199999999998s)]
*  He said, but I've discovered if you have 8 to 12 uncorrelated investments, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1813.52s)]
*  you'll reduce your risk by 80% and increase your upside. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1819.44s)]
*  Now, what does that mean? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1822.8799999999999s)]
*  Uncorrelated. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1824.32s)]
*  Most people know, most people invest in stocks and they think the economy is going great. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1824.96s)]
*  If it's going not so great, they invest a little bit more in bonds. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1829.04s)]
*  One's doing great. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1831.52s)]
*  The other tends to do it. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1832.48s)]
*  They're usually uncorrelated. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1833.28s)]
*  But in 2008, in 2020, that wasn't true. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1835.52s)]
*  They all dropped. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1838.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1839.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1839.44s)]
*  And if you go to your broker, it goes, I don't know what happened. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1839.92s)]
*  It's predictable. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1841.84s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1842.56s)]
*  So he explained to me lots of depth. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1843.52s)]
*  I won't explain here about why that happens, but he said, here's what's unbelievable, Tony. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1845.04s)]
*  He goes, if you have 8 to 12 that are uncorrelated investments, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1848.96s)]
*  he said, you can sleep so nicely at night and still have great returns. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1852.6399999999999s)]
*  So I went to go apply that. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1857.28s)]
*  What's hard because so many things are correlated today. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1859.28s)]
*  And if you go to the average person, they're investing in stocks and bonds [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1861.76s)]
*  and maybe real estate investment trusts, REITs, but they often get very correlated. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1864.32s)]
*  And then nothing works. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1869.12s)]
*  But there is another asset class that most people know nothing about called private equity, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1871.04s)]
*  private credit, and private real estate. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1876.08s)]
*  And if you go to the Fortune 400 and say what most billionaires in the world, one industry, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1878.48s)]
*  tech, no, real estate, no, financial services yet, but it's not hedge funds that go up and down. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1883.6799999999998s)]
*  It's these guys of private equity. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1889.04s)]
*  They're the kings of the financial world. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1890.32s)]
*  It's mind boggling. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1892.08s)]
*  And one of the reasons is they go out right now. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1893.28s)]
*  There used to be 8,000 companies you can invest in the stock market. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1896.0s)]
*  There's only 3,700 now. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1898.96s)]
*  They've dropped, dropped, dropped, dropped. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1900.72s)]
*  If you, the S&P 500 people are familiar with, 24% of that is five companies. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1902.08s)]
*  It's all concentrated in a small place. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1906.56s)]
*  Not a lot of ways to be uncorrelated. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1908.72s)]
*  So these guys go out and buy companies. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1911.44s)]
*  In the old days, they try to leverage them. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1913.68s)]
*  But now they actually do something cool. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1915.2s)]
*  They find a better CEO. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1916.88s)]
*  They find better marketing. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1918.16s)]
*  They put better technology and they put in AI. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1919.2s)]
*  They build the company up. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1921.76s)]
*  They buy it, build it up, and they sell it. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1922.96s)]
*  And they have time because when you invest with them, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1924.72s)]
*  your money's tied up for about five years in most of them. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1927.12s)]
*  They have a great business model. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1930.32s)]
*  They're making 2% a year, whether they make your money or not, and 20% of the upside. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1932.08s)]
*  Why do people invest with them? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1936.7199999999998s)]
*  For the last 35 years, I want your audience to hear this. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1938.32s)]
*  This is mind boggling. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1940.6399999999999s)]
*  Private equity around the world has outstripped every stock market in the world in its returns. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1942.32s)]
*  So we'll take the S&P 500 that people are familiar with probably here in the US. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1946.4799999999998s)]
*  Over the last 35 years, it's produced 9.2% compounded on average a year. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1950.4799999999998s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1955.04s)]
*  If you're getting 5%, your money's going to double every 14 years. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1956.24s)]
*  When you're at 9%, it only takes eight years to double your money. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1959.76s)]
*  But private equity, average private equity, it did 14.2% for those 35 years. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1963.52s)]
*  And what does that mean? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1968.48s)]
*  That means you're compounding 50% faster. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1969.68s)]
*  So I wrote this book because I want to answer the question, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1972.0s)]
*  how could people get bigger, how could they get to their goals faster with less risk? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1974.24s)]
*  And I know that people in the world that do it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1979.2s)]
*  So I started interviewing 13 of the biggest guys in the world, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1980.5600000000002s)]
*  running $100 billion funds who have produced 20% or more compounded, not 14.2%. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1983.28s)]
*  Here's the last part I know through all the numbers, hey, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1989.36s)]
*  just so you get the picture of everyone at home. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1991.52s)]
*  If you put a million dollars 35 years ago in the stock market, S&P, at 9.2%, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1994.32s)]
*  that's worth $26 million today if you never did a thing with it. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=1999.6s)]
*  If you put it in the same private equity at 14.2%, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2003.28s)]
*  it's $139 million for the same time and the same amount of money. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2006.56s)]
*  So that's why when you go to wealthy people, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2010.48s)]
*  remember I said asset allocation, the latest studies show ultra high net worth people [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2012.32s)]
*  have 46% of the money in private assets, private equity, private credit, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2017.04s)]
*  all of those pieces and only 29% in public markets. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2022.8799999999999s)]
*  So you want to have both. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2025.52s)]
*  Now, how can I write this book? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2026.8s)]
*  This is only for wealthy people. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2028.72s)]
*  It always annoyed me that the richest people in the world, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2029.84s)]
*  the government actually regulates and won't give the average person the opportunity. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2032.6399999999999s)]
*  You have to be an accredited investor. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2036.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2037.6799999999998s)]
*  You're familiar. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2038.24s)]
*  A million dollar net worth or $200,000 in income is the minimum to be able to do that. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2039.04s)]
*  Then you get these doors open to you. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2042.72s)]
*  There's a new law that the Congress, the House just passed it and Senate's now taking it up. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2046.0s)]
*  It was bipartisan. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2049.92s)]
*  It passed the House already just a couple months ago. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2050.88s)]
*  They're taking it up now. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2053.44s)]
*  That allows anyone to not have to have that money to simply take a test. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2054.64s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, you have the same quality investments [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2058.64s)]
*  that have these huge returns available to you, potentially anyway, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2061.2s)]
*  than you've never had access to before. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2064.4s)]
*  A lot of people built a business and sold it, made money. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2066.16s)]
*  They don't know how to invest. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2068.16s)]
*  So once you take the test, you can do this. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2069.2799999999997s)]
*  And the best part of it all is there are opportunities, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2071.52s)]
*  and we can talk about it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2075.2s)]
*  I know I've been talking forever here, but that allow you to do things [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2076.16s)]
*  that only the wealthiest people in the world will do. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2078.96s)]
*  Because when I saw this, I said, OK, now I can find my 8 to 12. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2080.48s)]
*  I got a broader audience, different types of investments that are correlated. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2083.6s)]
*  This is exciting. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2087.52s)]
*  But then I went to go make investments and it's kind of like [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2088.7999999999997s)]
*  going to the best club in New York and you got the money, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2092.24s)]
*  but if you don't know the right people, you're not super attractive. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2095.3599999999997s)]
*  You're not getting in, right? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2097.84s)]
*  Or you have a Ferrari. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2099.1200000000003s)]
*  The new Ferraris are all sold in advance to people that already own a Ferrari. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2100.56s)]
*  Right? You just can't get one. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2104.2400000000002s)]
*  So I would get little pieces here and there because I was Tony Robbins [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2105.6800000000003s)]
*  or I had a friend or something, but not huge, not the amount I want to invest. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2109.04s)]
*  One day I'm sitting down with this friend of mine, Paul Tudor Jones. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2113.2000000000003s)]
*  He's a former partner. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2115.6000000000004s)]
*  He has started his own firm. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2116.6400000000003s)]
*  And I said, I'm so frustrated. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2118.2400000000002s)]
*  I see private equity as the best investments in the world, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2119.84s)]
*  but the best guys, it's impossible to get in or you get a little tiny sliver. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2122.08s)]
*  He's Tony. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2126.7200000000003s)]
*  Can I tell you where I make my majority of my investments? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2127.36s)]
*  And this guy's super successful. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2130.64s)]
*  So I'm leaning in. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2131.92s)]
*  Yes. Tell me. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2132.88s)]
*  He goes, there's this place in Houston, a group called CAS that taught me something. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2134.0s)]
*  I didn't, I said Houston. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2137.76s)]
*  I'm expecting him to say New York, London, Singapore. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2139.04s)]
*  He goes, that's off the beaten path, but they're the best at this. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2142.0s)]
*  He goes, there's a way for you where you don't have to try to get in, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2144.16s)]
*  where you can buy a tiny sliver of the ownership of the companies that own all those funds. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2148.32s)]
*  And then you get the two and 20. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2153.6800000000003s)]
*  You get cashflow and the growth like you're an owner right side by side with them. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2155.2s)]
*  I said, what? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2159.8399999999997s)]
*  And he started explaining to me how that happens. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2161.2799999999997s)]
*  And so now I own a piece of 65 different private equity firms, like Vista, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2163.3599999999997s)]
*  a hundred billion dollar firm written by one of the smartest people I know, Robert Smith. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2167.9199999999996s)]
*  He built things in the SaaS industry. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2172.96s)]
*  I have them across different industries. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2175.2s)]
*  They're all multi-billion dollar, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, a hundred billion dollar firms. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2176.56s)]
*  And I have a sliver of each of them as an owner. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2180.3199999999997s)]
*  And then I don't just get one fund. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2182.96s)]
*  I get all the funds, the ones that in the past, the ones are doing now, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2184.24s)]
*  the ones they do in the future. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2186.64s)]
*  So that's just one example. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2188.0s)]
*  Another example is people were trying to get returns on bonds forever. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2189.7599999999998s)]
*  Now they've gone up, you know, four or 5%. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2194.3199999999997s)]
*  They're reasonable, but forever they were at zero because of the interest rates. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2196.4799999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2199.6s)]
*  So people started looking for, you know, how do I get a better return? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2200.24s)]
*  And they started investing in junk bonds back in 2021 junk bond market went like this. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2204.16s)]
*  You know, they call it the high yield return market. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2208.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2211.8399999999997s)]
*  Because there's risk that accompanies it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2212.08s)]
*  There's a huge risk and they're only given 3.9%. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2213.52s)]
*  But in a world where we're getting one, one and a half and two, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2216.32s)]
*  people started saying, I'll do it. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2218.88s)]
*  I was making investments in private credit because the banks, a lot of them, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2220.72s)]
*  as you know, Silicon Valley and so forth, have had challenges. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2225.2s)]
*  They all tightened over the last 10 years. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2227.28s)]
*  Companies money, they go to these private equity guys. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2229.44s)]
*  They're really good at evaluating and they make loans to them. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2232.0s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2235.28s)]
*  When people were trying to get 3.9% on these big risky things, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2236.16s)]
*  I was getting 9% on private credit. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2240.0s)]
*  And you know, if you own your house and you have a fixed rate mortgage [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2242.48s)]
*  and interest rates did what they've done the last two years, you're okay. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2246.4s)]
*  You still got 3%. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2248.96s)]
*  But if you have an adjustable mortgage, it's different, right? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2251.2000000000003s)]
*  A floating rate. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2253.84s)]
*  Well, business loans are on a floating rate. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2254.7200000000003s)]
*  So those firms that I own, well, they were only company to businesses, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2256.8s)]
*  money to businesses of 5 and 6%. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2260.48s)]
*  Now those same, they've adjusted. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2262.8s)]
*  They have to. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2265.28s)]
*  So now they're paying us, you know, 11, 12, 13% for the same loan. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2266.08s)]
*  That's less than 1% failure rate amongst that marketplace. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2270.88s)]
*  Any bank would die for that. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2273.52s)]
*  So these guys are so smart. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2274.88s)]
*  So it's like less risky. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2276.3199999999997s)]
*  Now the limitation is your money's tied up for a period. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2277.92s)]
*  Can I ask a dumb question? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2280.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2281.04s)]
*  No, no dumb questions. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2281.2799999999997s)]
*  I have some dumb questions. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2283.44s)]
*  Here's one. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2284.96s)]
*  Why would... [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2285.92s)]
*  That's the question I asked. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2287.68s)]
*  Why would you go if you're seeking to borrow money, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2290.0s)]
*  why would you go to the private credit markets rather than a bank? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2293.36s)]
*  Because the banks aren't loaning money to a lot of those companies. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2296.48s)]
*  Do you know how many companies are from 100 million to 3 billion? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2298.4s)]
*  It's this giant market and they have a real rough time. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2301.28s)]
*  Now if you're going to JP Morgan, your Apple is easy to get money [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2304.1600000000003s)]
*  and they don't need it anyway, but it's easy to get that. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2307.6s)]
*  But if you're one of those smaller companies under 3 billion, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2309.36s)]
*  tough to do it banks, extremely tough to do it banks. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2312.64s)]
*  So guess what? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2315.36s)]
*  They open the market for them and they develop a relationship. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2316.08s)]
*  They want to borrow again. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2319.12s)]
*  Private credit guys know you're good. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2320.48s)]
*  They make another loan for you. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2321.92s)]
*  So it's great for them. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2323.36s)]
*  But I'm not just making those higher returns. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2324.48s)]
*  I'm also making the 2 and 20 along the way. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2326.32s)]
*  It's mind blowing. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2329.04s)]
*  I'll give you a third one. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2329.92s)]
*  I always wanted, I grew up totally poor and I always wanted to own a sports team [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2331.6800000000003s)]
*  because I wanted to be a professional baseball player. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2334.96s)]
*  I used to go to the Dodger Stadium way back in the stadium, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2337.52s)]
*  back there the cheapest seats and I always wanted that. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2340.0800000000004s)]
*  And so at one point I finally made enough money that I could participate [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2343.6000000000004s)]
*  in the building of the LAFC football club. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2347.04s)]
*  I got to be one of the early investors and design, help design the club [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2348.96s)]
*  and it was fun, stadium, the whole thing. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2352.48s)]
*  But the microscope I went through for a year to get qualified, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2354.6400000000003s)]
*  besides your money is insane. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2357.44s)]
*  A new loan was passed over the last three years [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2359.28s)]
*  that a few firms have been able to participate in [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2361.76s)]
*  because they don't use leverage. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2363.84s)]
*  And you can now invest in companies and get a little slice of teams, multiple teams. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2365.44s)]
*  So I worked so hard to have the LAFC. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2371.04s)]
*  Now I have a piece of the Golden State Warriors. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2373.04s)]
*  I have a piece of the LA Dodgers. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2375.2000000000003s)]
*  I have a piece of the Boston Red Sox. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2377.04s)]
*  I have a piece of the Pittsburgh, you know, what do you call it, hockey team. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2378.64s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2383.6s)]
*  And what's amazing is this used to be putting butts in seats. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2385.44s)]
*  But what this is is something not correlated with the stock market, nothing at all. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2387.6800000000003s)]
*  When we have inflation, they charge more for the hot dog and people pay it [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2391.6800000000003s)]
*  because they have fanatics. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2395.04s)]
*  That's what fan means. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  Fanatics are people that, first of all, you've got a legal monopoly. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2397.6s)]
*  No one else can compete with you in that city. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2401.04s)]
*  That's pretty amazing. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2403.2000000000003s)]
*  Second of all, you've got fanatic fans. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2404.2400000000002s)]
*  Third of all, you have a business that does well even inflationary times. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2406.0s)]
*  And if you know, Michael Jordan paid what's 200 and I think it was $38 million [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2409.44s)]
*  for his piece of his team and be 18. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2413.8399999999997s)]
*  He just sold it 12 years later for 3 billion and kept some of it. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2416.56s)]
*  That's the kind of growth in the last 10 years. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2420.3199999999997s)]
*  The growth across Major League Baseball, NBA, hockey and soccer, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2423.2s)]
*  which are the ones I own together, have averaged 18% compounded per year. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2427.8399999999997s)]
*  So to give you a sense, like at 20%, your money is doubling every three and a half years, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2432.24s)]
*  you know, at 14% about every five years. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2436.24s)]
*  So if you want to get to your goals quicker, these are fun ways to do it. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2439.2s)]
*  And they never were available before. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2443.2799999999997s)]
*  You won't find this in any of the books that I'm aware of anywhere in the world [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2444.48s)]
*  because it's kind of part of this network of people. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2447.04s)]
*  But you can become that now because you'll be able to tap into this [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2449.68s)]
*  just by either being qualified or getting the education to qualify yourself and taking the test. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2453.2s)]
*  What's your view? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2457.2799999999997s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2458.24s)]
*  What is your view of debt? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2459.12s)]
*  So a lot of people feel like they're trapped because they [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2461.2s)]
*  are maxed out on their credit cards, honestly. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2464.24s)]
*  So what do you do about that? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2465.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, you have to pay it down. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2467.2799999999997s)]
*  You have to develop a plan. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2468.56s)]
*  You got a spending plan and or find a way to earn more by finding a way to add value, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2469.7599999999998s)]
*  some new skill, new ability, some new business, some new, you know, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2474.48s)]
*  hustle that you're going to do on the side. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2477.7599999999998s)]
*  But I think the biggest thing you got to realize is if you take money and you [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2479.36s)]
*  borrow money to buy a flat screen TV, that's pretty idiotic because that's going to depreciate. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2482.72s)]
*  It's going to give no value. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2487.44s)]
*  But if you borrowed some money to buy a tractor for your farm, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2488.32s)]
*  that's going to make you more productive. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2492.08s)]
*  You'll be able to pay back the loan and be more productive and your business grow. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2493.52s)]
*  So the question is, are you using it just to survive or get things or are you using [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2497.04s)]
*  it to get more resources? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2501.7599999999998s)]
*  When you use it for more resources, then debt can be very valuable for people. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2503.04s)]
*  But too much debt will stress anybody out and too much debt will take any company down if [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2506.4s)]
*  they're out inbounds. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2510.48s)]
*  So you know, you've got a more flexible view of it. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2512.4s)]
*  There are times when you think debt is wise and times when it's unwise. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2515.04s)]
*  And it's for not only the times, it's what's it for. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2517.7599999999998s)]
*  Is it for increased productivity? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2520.48s)]
*  Is it for something that's going to expand your capacity, your skill, your ability, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2522.24s)]
*  tools for your business, tools for your career? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2525.44s)]
*  Or is it just for a purchase of something that you probably should just wait on because [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2527.6s)]
*  once you spend that money, you're paying interest on it now. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2531.68s)]
*  High interest. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2534.16s)]
*  I mean, credit cards are now just insane. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2535.12s)]
*  They were insane before, but I don't know. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2537.12s)]
*  I saw the other day. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2538.96s)]
*  I don't know if it's accurate. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2539.6s)]
*  I saw that the average was over 20% now. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2540.64s)]
*  I mean, that's insane to borrow money at that level for some consumer item. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2543.28s)]
*  So you would opt out of that immediately? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2548.16s)]
*  I'd opt out of that and I'd start paying that down and then I'd start to take a percentage of my [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2550.48s)]
*  income, even if it's super small, and say I'm going to use this to be an owner. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2554.64s)]
*  I'm going to take it off the top and then I'll figure out how to invest it. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2557.68s)]
*  But I got to have that automated by my bank or by my investment company. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2560.4s)]
*  So I don't see it and I'll start to adjust. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2563.44s)]
*  And then I start to have it. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2565.68s)]
*  I mean, look at people don't understand. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2566.8799999999997s)]
*  They have all heard of compounding. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2568.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2569.92s)]
*  The richest people in the world don't do it by getting rich. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2570.72s)]
*  How many athletes have you interviewed? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2572.72s)]
*  How many movie stars you interviewed that were rich? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2574.48s)]
*  They made $10 million a year. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2577.7599999999998s)]
*  Kim Basinger used to be the highest paid actress of the 90s. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2579.2799999999997s)]
*  One Academy Awards was getting $10 million a picture went bankrupt. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2582.56s)]
*  We both know Mike Tyson, a good friend of ours, right? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2587.04s)]
*  And Mike, I love Mike to death. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2588.96s)]
*  He made a half a billion dollars in income and went bankrupt. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2590.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2593.92s)]
*  So that's not the way that you get wealthy. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2594.4s)]
*  You get wealthy by taking a little bit of money over time and compounding it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2596.32s)]
*  So I tell parents, teach your kid who's 19, put $300 a month away. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2599.04s)]
*  Sounds like a lot, but they don't have any overhead. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2604.72s)]
*  They can do it. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2606.16s)]
*  Put in the stock market, average returns 8% over time, 8 to 10. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2607.44s)]
*  Don't let them touch it. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2611.44s)]
*  And if they started at 19 and just do it to 27 years old, 300 bucks a month, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2612.64s)]
*  the total amounts like 28 grand over those eight years. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2617.52s)]
*  Never invest again. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2620.4s)]
*  They're set. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2622.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2623.84s)]
*  Let's say they have a brother. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2624.64s)]
*  He starts at 27. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2625.6s)]
*  Same amount of money, 300 bucks and does it to least 65. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2627.04s)]
*  He's put $138,000 roughly in and he's done it for 38 years, not eight years. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2630.32s)]
*  He has less money at the end because compounding, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2636.4s)]
*  the first guy's got 1.8 million and all he did was invest for eight years, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2639.6s)]
*  300 bucks a month, put it in the stock market. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2644.3199999999997s)]
*  The second one has 1.5 million, but he didn't have as much time. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2646.7999999999997s)]
*  He took longer to do it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2650.3199999999997s)]
*  He started later so he didn't get the same level of compounding. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2651.52s)]
*  So compounding, just like the million versus 139 million, 26 or 139, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2653.92s)]
*  it's both getting in the game and it's where you put it. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2658.08s)]
*  And so this book is trying to show people where you put it. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2660.96s)]
*  And then I interviewed 13 of the masters of the universe and found out like, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2663.04s)]
*  what is their approach? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2667.6s)]
*  Ironically, it's what I taught you earlier, I mentioned earlier. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2668.72s)]
*  Their whole focus is not to just buy a stock when it's down or buy a company [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2671.52s)]
*  when it's down. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2675.28s)]
*  They want to buy a company, right? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2675.76s)]
*  But the whole thing is how do we add value? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2677.28s)]
*  How do we take this company and make it more valuable than it's ever been and [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2679.12s)]
*  then take it public or sell it to a bigger company? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2682.88s)]
*  And that's where they make their profits. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2685.28s)]
*  And their other value is they don't drop as much because when markets go down, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2686.56s)]
*  they can buy. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2690.2400000000002s)]
*  When markets go up, they can sell because they've tied up your money for five years. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2691.28s)]
*  So all your money can't go in those types of investments because you need some [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2693.92s)]
*  liquidity. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2697.04s)]
*  But if you're going to want to try to maximize to get to a retirement in the [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2698.08s)]
*  world we're in today, it might be nice to have the smartest people in the world on [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2701.44s)]
*  your side and be their partner making 2% right beside them as an owner in the [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2704.64s)]
*  business and making 20% of the upside. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2709.44s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2712.24s)]
*  They have a, these are very few of them this small, a billion dollars in funds. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2712.72s)]
*  They're going to be guaranteed 20%, right? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2716.96s)]
*  That's what the 2% is going to give them 20 million bucks a year for five years. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2720.16s)]
*  They're going to make a hundred million dollars whether they make money or not. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2723.52s)]
*  Most of them are good at making money. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2727.2799999999997s)]
*  So in five years, they take the billion to a two billion. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2728.48s)]
*  Didn't have to hire a ton more people and they're going to make 20% of that side. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2731.7599999999998s)]
*  They make $300 million on a billion. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2735.12s)]
*  That's why there's more of those in the Fortune 400 than any other industry. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2737.84s)]
*  So I said there's a good pathway. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2741.92s)]
*  Perhaps that's a path that you and I should take advantage of as long as we're smart [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2743.84s)]
*  enough to see what's there and we'll then educate ourselves instead of living like [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2747.44s)]
*  I can't do it and the game's against me. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2750.16s)]
*  Well, there are some things that- [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2752.8s)]
*  That's actually what I wanted to close on since we began the conversation by my [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2754.24s)]
*  noting that there's a sadness palpable and you pointed to the reality of that and then [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2758.24s)]
*  suggested an upside to it or at least a different way to think about it. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2764.0s)]
*  You've mentioned twice the perception that people have that's grounded in some reality [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2767.2799999999997s)]
*  that the system is rigged and you kind of can't win. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2771.7599999999998s)]
*  You said it emerged after 2008. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2774.4799999999996s)]
*  I think that's right, but it's only become more profound. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2776.64s)]
*  I mean, people really feel that way. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2779.68s)]
*  True. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2781.3599999999997s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2783.2s)]
*  I say you got- your experience of your life is not your life. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2784.56s)]
*  Your experience of your life is the life you focus on. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2790.64s)]
*  So right now, if I want to figure out what's wrong, I'm sure I can find a million things. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2793.52s)]
*  I got a hundred plus companies, lots of employees, all the world, different industries. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2797.12s)]
*  What are the chances right now somebody's screwing up? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2802.56s)]
*  If screwing up is doing what I don't think they should be, 100%. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2804.72s)]
*  I can focus on how to be all stressed out or I can focus on what I can control. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2807.8399999999997s)]
*  I can focus on what can be dying, focus on what's great. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2811.2s)]
*  What's wrong is always available, so it's what's right. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2814.32s)]
*  We've always had problems like that. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2816.24s)]
*  Study history. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2817.44s)]
*  I hear people talking about this is the worst time in history politically. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2818.24s)]
*  We've never been in each other's throats like this. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2821.36s)]
*  I don't have it with me. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2823.36s)]
*  I wish I could pull it out for you. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2824.08s)]
*  I have this little write-up that's two different posters that were during the time of Adams [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2825.36s)]
*  versus Jefferson. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2829.6s)]
*  If you read what they were saying about each other, it looks calm compared to what Republicans [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2830.88s)]
*  and Democrats and liberals and conservatives say today. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2834.8s)]
*  We've always had it. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2837.12s)]
*  It's cycles. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2837.92s)]
*  We go through cycles. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2838.4s)]
*  And if you know cycles, you're not so fearful. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2839.44s)]
*  You say, okay, this has happened before. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2841.76s)]
*  What do I need to do to take advantage of this? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2843.12s)]
*  But if you just go in a mindset of, oh my God, it's rigged against me. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2844.7999999999997s)]
*  I can't win, then it's self-fulfilling. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2847.3599999999997s)]
*  So you have to not be one of the many. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2849.12s)]
*  You have to think differently. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2850.96s)]
*  You've got to educate yourself. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2852.24s)]
*  One of the biggest things Jerome Rohn taught me is he said, look, if you want to have an [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2853.52s)]
*  extraordinary life, you need to feed your mind and not let everybody else feed it. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2857.12s)]
*  And so when I was totally broke, my mom kicked my dad out. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2862.24s)]
*  She chased me out on Christmas Eve with a knife. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2866.0s)]
*  She wouldn't have killed me or anything, but I wasn't going back in that house. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2867.52s)]
*  She was a little crazy. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2869.8399999999997s)]
*  She abused alcohol and prescription drugs. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2871.12s)]
*  And I love my mom. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2873.2799999999997s)]
*  I would be who I am without my mom. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2873.8399999999997s)]
*  But I assume you're bigger than her. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2875.04s)]
*  I am bigger than her, but I was 5'2 in high school, 5'1. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2877.2s)]
*  And she grabbed me here and smashed me and poured liquid soap down my throat. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2880.4s)]
*  I mean, she was, you know, you learn to acquiesce. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2883.2s)]
*  But anyway, my point is I was on my own trying to figure out what the heck I'm going to do. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2886.64s)]
*  And, you know, it's Christmas Eve. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2890.88s)]
*  I'm sleeping on the hill and it starts raining. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2892.3199999999997s)]
*  I sleep in somebody's, you know, friend of mine's laundry room. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2894.16s)]
*  And then I felt so depressed. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2898.16s)]
*  I remember Jim Rohn, I'd met him when I was 17, saying, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2901.12s)]
*  every day you got to stand guard at the door of your mind. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2904.24s)]
*  He said, you should read 30 minutes a day. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2906.48s)]
*  Not what comes to you these days on your phone. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2908.16s)]
*  Not clickbait. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2910.72s)]
*  Something philosophy or a skill or a psychology or a tool that makes you better. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2912.3199999999997s)]
*  Read it just 30 minutes a day. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2917.52s)]
*  It'll change your life because you're feeding your mind something different [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2918.64s)]
*  than what everybody else feeds them. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2921.04s)]
*  And so I put this little five-step plan together back then. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2922.48s)]
*  I did it again back in 2008 because I had all these companies, not the same numbers now. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2925.44s)]
*  And it was rough. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2930.24s)]
*  In 2008, my billionaire friends were in trouble and so was my barber. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2931.36s)]
*  I mean, we all were affected by it. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2934.24s)]
*  And I did the same five steps. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2935.92s)]
*  Step one, if you want to be emotionally fit, if you want to be able to say, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2937.12s)]
*  when all hell's breaking loose, I can still do incredibly well, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2941.2799999999997s)]
*  you've got to every single day do something to feed and strengthen your mind. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2944.08s)]
*  So for me, that's reading 30 minutes a day or doing an audio. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2948.16s)]
*  That's easier because I call audio net time. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2950.88s)]
*  No extra time. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2953.2s)]
*  I can do while I'm driving, while I'm working out. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2954.0s)]
*  And I get to feed my mind something different than all the crap that comes to you that's [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2956.0s)]
*  designed to get your attention and make money from you. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2959.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2961.12s)]
*  So every day, 30 minutes a day. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2961.68s)]
*  And then Ron used to say, Jim Rohn used to say to me, I'll never forget, he said, Tony, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2963.6s)]
*  he goes, I got a question for you. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2967.12s)]
*  He said, if your worst enemy puts sugar in your coffee, what's going to happen? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2968.72s)]
*  I said, you're going to have sweet coffee. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2975.7599999999998s)]
*  So what if your best friend, a family member, somebody you love, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2976.96s)]
*  by accident drops one ounce of strychnine in your coffee? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2979.6s)]
*  What happens? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2983.2799999999997s)]
*  I said, you're dead. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2983.7599999999998s)]
*  He goes, that's right. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2984.96s)]
*  Life is both sugar and strychnine. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2985.7599999999998s)]
*  So watch your coffee. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2987.2799999999997s)]
*  Which he said, every day, stand guard at the door of your mind and what you let in. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2988.08s)]
*  Because that's what's controlling your life. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2992.96s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2994.4s)]
*  And then the second piece I added to it was, I learned, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2994.96s)]
*  was that your mind is controlled by your body as well. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=2998.0s)]
*  You can't separate them. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3000.48s)]
*  So every day you got to feed and strengthen your body in some way. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3001.36s)]
*  You got to push it beyond what you're comfortable with. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3003.84s)]
*  Today, most people are so unhappy in their work. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3006.64s)]
*  I just read this study the other day. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3008.88s)]
*  38% of the people, it's like up 33% from the early days of COVID, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3010.56s)]
*  are totally unhappy in their work. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3016.8s)]
*  They want to do something else. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3018.5600000000004s)]
*  They don't look forward to it. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3019.92s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3021.44s)]
*  What's happened? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3022.88s)]
*  They don't want to go to work because they were paid to stay at home [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3023.52s)]
*  and they got used to it. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3026.6400000000003s)]
*  But now that they're home, they're feeling isolated and alone. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3027.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's because the path of least resistance will never make you proud. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3031.6800000000003s)]
*  It'll never make you happy. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3036.0800000000004s)]
*  It'll never make you strong. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3037.36s)]
*  You get strong building muscle by pushing against something that's difficult. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3038.8s)]
*  So these people are trying to have so much self-care every moment [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3042.5600000000004s)]
*  and be by themselves and nurture themselves that they're not growing. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3046.64s)]
*  And when you're just by yourself and you don't have something to serve more than yourself, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3050.08s)]
*  you're not going to do much. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3054.4s)]
*  And also we sat forever and the average person, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3055.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know what the real weight gain was. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3057.2799999999997s)]
*  I read one study said 14 pounds, one said 18. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3058.96s)]
*  I don't know what's really real, but most people gain weight [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3062.08s)]
*  and they were seemingly doing nothing. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3063.92s)]
*  But when you push your body to lift some weights or to walk extremely fast [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3065.36s)]
*  or to run or something where you get in the pool where you have to push [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3069.44s)]
*  and you get strong, it changes your emotion. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3073.52s)]
*  Because fear and anger are the two emotions that mess up most of your life, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3075.36s)]
*  your relationships, your business, your life. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3079.6800000000003s)]
*  And fear and anger are both physical. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3081.76s)]
*  Do you get really fearful? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3083.76s)]
*  I don't know if you ever felt that in your gut or the back of your throat. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3085.1200000000003s)]
*  It's physical, but so is courage. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3087.76s)]
*  Courage is you're scared, but you do it anyway. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3090.2400000000002s)]
*  But that's also physical. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3092.0s)]
*  It's a sense of certainty. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3093.1200000000003s)]
*  And when you push your body, you get it. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3094.08s)]
*  Third, if someone's listening saying, how do I have a better year? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3095.44s)]
*  Third thing you got to do is find some great role models. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3098.4s)]
*  Because in spite of all the BS you hear out there, yes, I'm no dummy. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3100.88s)]
*  The majority of people are not happy. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3104.24s)]
*  They're not fit. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3105.7599999999998s)]
*  They don't have great relationships. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3106.64s)]
*  They don't have great passion. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3107.9199999999996s)]
*  They don't love their work. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3108.9599999999996s)]
*  That's not everybody. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3110.3999999999996s)]
*  I like studying the few who do, finding out what they do and do what they do. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3112.08s)]
*  So the same seeds reap the same rewards. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3115.9199999999996s)]
*  So you find great role models. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3117.6s)]
*  Role models make it real. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3119.68s)]
*  And then fourth, you need a massive action plan. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3121.3599999999997s)]
*  You got to get yourself in action, not wait till everything's perfect. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3123.6s)]
*  And if you try something and it doesn't work, try something else. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3126.3999999999996s)]
*  If that doesn't work, try something else. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3129.7599999999998s)]
*  Most people try it, it didn't work and they give up. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3131.4399999999996s)]
*  It's like I said to people, how long would you give your average child [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3133.36s)]
*  to learn how to walk? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3137.2000000000003s)]
*  Before you cut them off and said, dude, you're just not a walker. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3138.7200000000003s)]
*  Your kid's going to go, what are you, crazy? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3142.4s)]
*  Your parents are going to go, my kid's going to keep trying until he or she walks. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3144.48s)]
*  That's why most people walk. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3147.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3148.6400000000003s)]
*  Just not a walker. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3149.2000000000003s)]
*  So different. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3150.8s)]
*  But that's how people's mindsets are. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3151.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3153.1200000000003s)]
*  So if you have a massive action plan and keep changing your approach, you'll get there. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3153.6800000000003s)]
*  And then the fifth step to me, and I did this way back then, was [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3158.0s)]
*  go find somebody worse off than you and take care of them, do something for them. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3161.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3164.24s)]
*  Because that always changes the game. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3164.64s)]
*  So I was fed when I had no money and food, so I fed two families and then four and then eight [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3167.04s)]
*  and then a billion meals now. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3171.44s)]
*  Now we're going to a hundred billion. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3172.64s)]
*  I couldn't even conceive that kind of number then. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3174.64s)]
*  I did what was in front of me. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3176.48s)]
*  I fed two families and it felt so amazing because when I was with these families, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3177.44s)]
*  I didn't go as the person giving it. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3181.04s)]
*  I went as the delivery person because I didn't want to offend them, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3182.96s)]
*  but I wanted to see the impact. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3185.36s)]
*  And to see these families, their lives change and their families and their children change [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3186.88s)]
*  and the joy in their life. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3190.56s)]
*  And I know for me, it wasn't the food that changed my life. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3192.0s)]
*  It was that day when I got fed, I made a new belief that strangers care. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3194.24s)]
*  And strangers care about me and my family, that I need to care about strangers. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3199.2799999999997s)]
*  One of the reasons I'm here today. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3202.56s)]
*  So you can change somebody's life by doing that, but also it creates contrast. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3204.08s)]
*  You think your life's so difficult and you see somebody else's life. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3208.0s)]
*  Totally right. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3211.12s)]
*  Or you travel the world and you realize America is a pretty damn good place with all its flaws. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3212.16s)]
*  It's as good a place as any place on earth for most people. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3216.72s)]
*  It's just providing those steps, those little things you can do can change it all. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3220.72s)]
*  And that's by the way what I'm doing. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3224.88s)]
*  I'm doing this again this year. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3226.16s)]
*  I want to just mention so people want to join us. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3227.36s)]
*  The whole focus of our is a three-day seminar. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3229.84s)]
*  It's two and a half, three hours a day, three days in a row, the 25th of January to the 27th. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3232.48s)]
*  Starts at 2 p.m. Eastern, but we have people all over the earth, 195 countries, a little 10. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3236.7999999999997s)]
*  You'll be connected to over a million people in our community who can help you and support you. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3241.6s)]
*  But the kind of results people got by doing that when they were stuck at home before, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3246.0s)]
*  because you can do it from your home or your office with your friends, family, by yourself. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3249.12s)]
*  I had one guy that stands out for me. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3252.0s)]
*  It's this guy. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3254.4s)]
*  I had to bring him up on screen. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3255.92s)]
*  I interact with people. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3257.12s)]
*  And this guy is in his bed. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3258.3199999999997s)]
*  He weighed over 700 pounds. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3260.56s)]
*  He'd been in bed for six years naked. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3262.7999999999997s)]
*  His brother died. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3266.24s)]
*  He took some drugs to try to deal with it. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3267.2s)]
*  Those drugs affected his body and he had breathing oxygen. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3269.2799999999997s)]
*  He was told he'd never be able to breathe on his own without the oxygen in bed. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3272.7999999999997s)]
*  Let's go to the bathroom. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3276.16s)]
*  He never gets up to go to the bathroom. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3277.12s)]
*  Never been out of the bed. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3278.4s)]
*  He got so inspired that he took a coat hanger, but like one of those little light metal things. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3280.0s)]
*  And he started doing this little daily practice of doing these exercises. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3285.44s)]
*  And I gave him a task. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3288.88s)]
*  I said, you do these things. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3290.32s)]
*  You get to where you can go to the bathroom. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3291.76s)]
*  You get to where you can drive a car again. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3292.8s)]
*  I'll fly you to my seminars, my guest, and we'll take Nick's level. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3294.32s)]
*  We'll have you walk on fire. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3297.28s)]
*  We'll do the whole thing. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3298.32s)]
*  He got inspired. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3299.28s)]
*  He did this, got muscle strength, got off the oxygen, made it to the bathroom. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3300.56s)]
*  I think it took him three months. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3304.64s)]
*  He's now 700 pounds. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3306.2400000000002s)]
*  He's lost 310 pounds to give you an idea. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3307.68s)]
*  Came to the seminar, transformed his life. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3310.0s)]
*  And he never would have seen it because you never come to a seminar of you in bed. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3312.0s)]
*  I had this guy that was just got out of prison. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3315.8399999999997s)]
*  I just saw him two weeks ago. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3318.24s)]
*  And he's a pretty tough guy. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3320.3999999999996s)]
*  Tattoos all over his body. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3322.48s)]
*  You know, people treated me and he got really mean. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3324.7999999999997s)]
*  He was really horrible with women. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3326.96s)]
*  Went to jail and got out and you had a little girl and couldn't see her. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3329.04s)]
*  They wouldn't let him see her. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3332.72s)]
*  And so he set a goal to start changing himself. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3334.0s)]
*  Started doing all these little daily practices. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3336.48s)]
*  And I was on two weeks ago. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3338.48s)]
*  He's got full custody now. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3339.68s)]
*  He's able to be with his daughter. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3340.88s)]
*  He's coaching other people. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3342.2400000000002s)]
*  He attended the seminar in his truck. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3343.92s)]
*  He was driving a truck for a living, getting out of prison. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3346.32s)]
*  He pulled over and he's watching on that. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3348.2400000000002s)]
*  And so a woman who lost her baby, her child at two years old, the cancer is horrific. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3350.4s)]
*  Seeing her change. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3356.56s)]
*  Seeing people double or triple their businesses. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3357.36s)]
*  So we have amazing abilities. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3359.12s)]
*  It's no BS to say you can go from where you are to where you want to go. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3360.96s)]
*  But you'll never get there with, it's all rigged against me. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3363.44s)]
*  Some of it is rigged against us. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3365.84s)]
*  It's true. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3367.1200000000003s)]
*  But that doesn't stop you from being able to still create an extraordinary quality of life [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3367.92s)]
*  if you build a path. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3371.1200000000003s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3373.52s)]
*  Tony Robbins. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7f0GIcUdQ&t=3374.1600000000003s)]
