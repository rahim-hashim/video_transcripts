# Glenn Greenwald Julian Assange, Ed Snowden, and Everything You Need to Know about Brazil
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4)
*  You arrive at the same conclusions I do 100% of the time, at least on Twitter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=0.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's an instinct. It's like, uh, and I guys, I think you begin with like a certain [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3.84s)]
*  kind of like inclination, right? View of who's running the country and how you feel about them [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=8.88s)]
*  and why you hate them. And then like everything else just kind of falls from falls from that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  It may even be deeper than that. It's like, what's important to you? Loyalty, honesty, children, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=18.96s)]
*  dogs. Totally, totally. Yeah. It's like what you get in life too. Yeah. Like we're roughly the same [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  age or obviously like a lot older, but in general, like we're the same. Are you older? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=30.32s)]
*  I think I'm like a year older. What year were you born? 1967. Okay. So you're two years older than me. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=34.56s)]
*  Okay. Congratulations on your robust youth. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=40.08s)]
*  Yeah. It's interesting. I think about, uh, lies the way I do about alcohol. I just don't want it [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=46.8s)]
*  in me at all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, cause you end up deluding yourself, which is the worst. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=52.24s)]
*  Sometimes you can consciously like deceive other people for whatever goal and you can tell yourself [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=57.04s)]
*  it's justified. And maybe sometimes it even is, but the worst thing is to delude yourself, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=60.88s)]
*  like to deceive yourself. There's nothing worse you can do to yourself. I mean, I've repeated [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=65.36s)]
*  so many lies in my life knowingly that I just don't want to do that again. Thank you for setting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=69.68s)]
*  up that Snowden meeting. Oh, I knew you guys were going to love each other. I was actually hoping he [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=76.64s)]
*  would change his mind and do an interview. I think it was a good step to doing one. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=80.8s)]
*  How is, uh, yeah. And even if I never interview him on camera, I was just grateful to meet him. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=84.72s)]
*  But so you are, you're the reason that we know any of this information. You were the guy who [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=90.16s)]
*  broke the story. Um, it did feel to me like Snowden was, it was more important for the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  U S government to capture and kill Ed Snowden, an American citizen than like any foreign terrorists. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  It was the biggest leak of top secret documents from the U S security state by far. He w- and he [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=109.36s)]
*  like planned it so meticulous. I mean, you're talking about the NSA, which is supposed to be [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=115.52s)]
*  like our leading intelligence agency. He was in it, stealing all their stuff over months, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=118.96s)]
*  figuring out how not to get caught. He walked out with it. He went to Hong Kong with it, having, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=124.72s)]
*  they have no idea any of that happened. And he was just waiting for us to come and then pass it all [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=129.52s)]
*  to us and like put it in all secret places. Like the only thing he cared about was getting that out [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=133.6s)]
*  before he ended up, you know, in prison or killed or whatever. He was so desperate for us to get [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=137.6s)]
*  there. Why didn't he do it? I mean, I really think it's for the reasons he said, like he really felt [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=141.68s)]
*  betrayed. You know, he went to enlist in the Iraq war. He enlisted in the army. He wanted to go [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=148.64s)]
*  fight in Iraq and obviously do that because you believe the mythology in a country. And the more [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=154.0s)]
*  he saw, the more he realized it was, you know, a fraud and it makes you like feel betrayed, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=160.16s)]
*  ethically betrayed. Like people who want to go fight in wars obviously have like a code of ethics [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  already, right? They're saying, I can risk my life for something that is greater than myself. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=171.84s)]
*  And then when you realize that like what you're told is greater than yourself is in fact a total [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  lie, that you're fighting for completely different reasons, you feel betrayed. And then the question [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=180.56s)]
*  is like, what is really bigger than myself? And he, like I said, he thought he was going to be [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=185.28s)]
*  killed or spend the rest of his life in prison. Like if I had to bet, we weren't even discussing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=190.0s)]
*  the possibility that he wouldn't end up free. It was inconceivable. Like that was the darkness [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=194.32s)]
*  that hung over this whole thing the whole time when we were doing it. Obviously I was very excited [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  about the story. We were plotting, we were strategizing, like it was under one, but the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=202.56s)]
*  whole time I felt this like sadness that this person had come to like admire and respect so much. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=206.32s)]
*  I was never going to see again. He was going to end up in prison for the rest of his life. Like [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=211.28s)]
*  that was for sure. That wasn't like a possibility. It was like almost inevitable. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=214.0s)]
*  And he knew that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=217.12s)]
*  Yeah, of course. Yeah. I mean, like obviously you don't, if you're at all ethical, like not [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=219.04s)]
*  just a journalist person, you don't use somebody as a source without making sure they understand [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=224.16s)]
*  the risks they're taking and the likely consequences. But he, you know, I remember the first conversation [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=229.28s)]
*  I had when I started talking to him, he was like, oh, well versed in the espionage act and like [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=233.12s)]
*  every single law that would be used against him, he fully understood he was sacrificing his whole [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=236.72s)]
*  life. He had to hide it from his girlfriend who he wanted to marry. That was the case. He was, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=240.72s)]
*  totally, we're totally in love, but he couldn't have her know anything because she would have [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=246.32s)]
*  been complicit and he was concerned she'd be vulnerable. You know, they would go after her, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=250.16s)]
*  start charging with her crimes to get at him. So we had to keep it all from her. He just disappeared. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=254.24s)]
*  He was like, I need to go on a trip, I need to business. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=259.2s)]
*  So, I mean, you're describing like one of the most ethical people I've ever met, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=262.0s)]
*  one of the most principled people ever. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=265.36s)]
*  Totally. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=267.36s)]
*  It's kind of revealing that he's considered like, the criminal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Number one. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=271.92s)]
*  Yeah, because he actually exposed real crimes and the, that's what always happens is the people who [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=272.8s)]
*  expose the crimes. I mean, like Daniel Ellsberg had documents showing that the U.S. government was [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=277.12s)]
*  telling American citizens they knew they were going to win the war at exactly the same time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=282.88s)]
*  Internally, they said they knew they could never win the war in Vietnam. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=286.64s)]
*  And like many other bodies too. He was like, you know, Daniel Ellsberg worked at the highest [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=289.92s)]
*  levels of the government forever. I mean, he got a PhD in nuclear policy and then, you know, was at [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=294.0s)]
*  the Rand Corporation with some of the most secret access ever. And then he just couldn't believe [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=299.68s)]
*  what he was seeing like inside these documents comparing them to the public statements. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=304.0s)]
*  And he was like, how am I going to live with myself for the rest of my life if I don't, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=307.68s)]
*  you know, make this known? And he, exactly the same thing. But of course, at the time, he was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=311.12s)]
*  completely vilified as a traitor, a Russian agent, the whole thing. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=315.76s)]
*  A hater of America. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=318.8s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, everybody like who wasn't on the left hated Daniel Ellsberg. And the only reason [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=319.84s)]
*  he didn't spend the rest of his life in prison is because of the misconduct of breaking it. They [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=324.64s)]
*  broke into a psychoanalyst's office to try and discover his psychosexual secrets to discredit [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=328.56s)]
*  him for. That was like that whole CIA group that did the Watergate break. And they also broke into [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=333.28s)]
*  his psychoanalyst's office and tried to steal all those files. And then when they couldn't, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=338.32s)]
*  they wanted to break into the psychoanalyst's home. And then that was like the one thing they didn't [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=343.52s)]
*  get permission for. But when that was discovered, the judge threw the case out solely because of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=347.2s)]
*  government misconduct. Had they not, he would have absolutely been convicted. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=350.64s)]
*  But he had the support effectively of the American media. I mean, Daniel Ellsberg. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  Because he commandeered them. That's like the first thing I did with Snowden was I went to, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  we went to every major media outlet that we wanted to work with in order to get them on our side. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=362.88s)]
*  Because if we didn't, we would have just been two like outsiders who wouldn't, they would have called [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=366.96s)]
*  us like non-journalists. They tried to do that. Mike Isikoff piece reported on them trying to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=371.6s)]
*  assassinate Snowden, but also create theories to arrest myself and Laura calling us information [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=375.6s)]
*  brokers and like, and like the whole time James Clapper would always, whenever he referred to us, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=380.32s)]
*  he would never call us journalists. He would always call us Snowden's like, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=385.36s)]
*  either than a betters or Snowden's co-conspirators. Cause they were trying to create a theory that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=389.84s)]
*  they could arrest us. That's why I didn't go back. That's why in the other word, nor I traveled for [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=394.56s)]
*  a year, they were being super threatening. You know, I had the best lawyers for the Guardian, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=397.76s)]
*  the kinds that could get Eric Holder on the phone. It worked with him, you know, those type of lawyers [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=401.76s)]
*  and they were like, if he comes back to New York, it becomes back to the U S can you guarantee that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=406.56s)]
*  he won't be arrested upon arrival? And they're like, right now we can't. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=410.4s)]
*  So that's why you live out of the country. Well, no, I mean, I had lived in Brazil already, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  but I was always going back to the U S but for a year I couldn't travel outside of Brazil. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=418.8s)]
*  The Brazilian government said, we will always protect you because I did a lot of reporting [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=422.88s)]
*  on how the NSA was spying on Brazil. So in Brazil, like the reporting was considered heroic [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=425.76s)]
*  and they were like, we'll never turn you over, but we can't guarantee your protection if you leave [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=431.36s)]
*  Brazil. So I stayed in Brazil for a year. It's just a funny that the Guardian was one of the places [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=435.12s)]
*  that ran the, this data, this information and WikiLeaks. They partnered with WikiLeaks as well. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=441.2s)]
*  Do you think the Guardian would run something like that? Nope, zero chance. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  Why? I mean, they, you know, they got taken over by completely different, like the editor at the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  time was like one of those old school British editors. Yes. And now it's run by this woman [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=455.12s)]
*  who's like best friends with the editor in chief of the, the, who was the other chief of the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  intercept who degraded it into a partisan outlet. And they're both just like standard level liberal [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=463.36s)]
*  white woman. And they're all into the whole, like everything, all that matters is Trump. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=468.24s)]
*  They have no animosity toward the security state agencies any longer because they perceive [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=473.36s)]
*  them correctly as their political allies. And there's no chance that they would have, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=478.16s)]
*  you know, run a story like that. So they're just totally correct. Do you ever hear any [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=486.64s)]
*  left liberals ever anymore talking about the evils of the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=490.32s)]
*  the US security state? Never, never, ever. Maybe Homeland Security for being too like aggressive [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=494.64s)]
*  with immigrants. But other than that, like the, that discourse is gone. If you talk about the CIA [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=499.84s)]
*  and the FBI now people that gets coded as like Trump, Trumpism and like warning about deep state, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  the deep state, like they mock the idea that there's a deep state that's like been fundamental to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=511.28s)]
*  left wing politics for as long as I can remember. And now it reads as like, you know, Trumpian [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=515.52s)]
*  right wing paranoia. It's just, it's, you know, any country run by its Intel and law enforcement [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=521.8399999999999s)]
*  agencies is an authoritarian country. It's not a democratic country. They're there. They were [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=526.96s)]
*  built to be outside of the democratic system. There's no doubt. They're built to be a secret [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=530.64s)]
*  agency within the government that is immune to democratic accountability. And the amazing thing [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=534.48s)]
*  is when they had those hearings, like after the Twitter files and all of that, every single Democrat [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=539.6s)]
*  stood up and said, like when Matt, if you want to testify, they were lecturing him saying like, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  have you ever considered the fact that the people at the CIA and the FBI and our security state [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  agencies are doing this to protect us, not to harm us. Can you imagine like, and like even though [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=554.4s)]
*  the like AOC same thing, like even the left wing sectors of the democratic party, there's no space [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=561.76s)]
*  to criticize. Are there any, are there any left liberals holding office? Have we started by the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=568.4s)]
*  way or no? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, we're on, we're on? Yeah, I think we're on. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=574.4s)]
*  didn't know, but I'm fine. You know what an Irish exit is, right? Well, this is what we chat anyway. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=580.4s)]
*  I was like, okay, we're just waiting until, but yeah, so the Irish exit, and I'm not Irish for the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=587.52s)]
*  record, but is when you sort of leave without saying anything, this is the Irish entrance. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=591.68s)]
*  You sort of start with that. Exactly. Exactly. Just sit down and start with no formal start. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=595.84s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, that to me, you know, because it's always so bizarre to me that, you know, for a [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  long time I was considered, you know, like a left wing kind of leading journalist and finger. And then [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=606.56s)]
*  at some point, like with the emergence of Trump, I had this huge breach with the left and my ally [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=614.16s)]
*  started becoming people on the right. I think that's now changed a little bit more since [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=619.5999999999999s)]
*  October 7th and the like, but I haven't changed a single one of my views. I think the primary, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=624.0s)]
*  the two primary views that I hold that used to be identified with the left that are now identified [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  with the right is free speech, which began as a left wing movement. I mean, the free speech [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=634.72s)]
*  movement began at Berkeley, some of the most important first amendment free speech precedents [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=639.36s)]
*  were written by the most left wing journalists. And like it was left wing Jewish lawyers at the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  ACLU who are fighting for the most absolute is versions of free speech and now free speech codes [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=647.76s)]
*  as a fascist value. And then the second is this critical scrutiny and focus that I've always had [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=652.48s)]
*  on the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and that two now codes as right wing. And the reason for that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=659.68s)]
*  is so disturbing. It's because those agencies became among the leading enemies of the Trump [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=665.28s)]
*  campaign. And then the Trump presidency, that's where Russia gate came from, was from the bowels [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=671.76s)]
*  of the CIA, the FBI, they were anonymously leaking every day in the New York Times and the Washington [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=675.04s)]
*  Post, all kinds of information that turned out to be false, but that was designed to sabotage [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=678.56s)]
*  Trump's campaign and then presidency and Democrats looked at that and said, why would we [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=682.9599999999999s)]
*  have any problem with these agencies? They're on our side and they are on that side. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=686.72s)]
*  And this inversion of politics and then you add things like neocons almost entirely migrating [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  to the Democratic party. Whereas when I started talking about politics in 2005, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=698.0s)]
*  neocons were being talked about as bloodthirsty, Hitlerian types, Nazis and the like. That's how [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=701.44s)]
*  liberals talked about them. And now like the most influential pundits in liberal politics are like [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=708.4s)]
*  Bill Kristol and David Frum and Nicole Wallace and all those Bush, Liz Cheney. Liz Cheney was [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=713.36s)]
*  hero of the year by mother Jones in 2022. Mother Jones is, you know, like a hardcore leftist radical [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=718.72s)]
*  who like broke the law. I mean, the idea that a hundred years from now, a newspaper named after [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=726.48s)]
*  her would be naming Liz Cheney as hero of the year. Like when people say like, why have you [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=732.08s)]
*  changed? What have you changed? I'm like, you're the one naming Liz Cheney hero of the year. I [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=738.16s)]
*  hate the Cheneys as much as I hated them 20 years ago. And this inversion of politics is [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=742.64s)]
*  so radical and so visible and so transparent and so abrupt, but it's changed almost everything. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  It does seem like maybe a lot of the kind of ACLU positions, which for the record, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=755.36s)]
*  I always liked. I always like Nat Hentoff, for example. Wonderful man. But it seems like maybe [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=761.84s)]
*  a lot of it wasn't sincere. And it was as soon as, you know, the ACLU kind of took power over [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=769.76s)]
*  American society, then it was like, now we have someone to protect. Now we're not on the side of [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=777.04s)]
*  the underdog. Now we're the overdog. I think there was authenticity to the ACLU in the sense that, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=780.64s)]
*  you know, like the, I remembered this from childhood. It was like one of the most influential [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=786.0s)]
*  events for me, even though I was only 10 at the time when it happened. I just became like very [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=790.24s)]
*  interested in it and started reading a lot more about it as a teenager in 1978, which was when the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=794.32s)]
*  American Nazi party, which was, you know, like a band of like 30 losers and misfits, but they like [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=801.84s)]
*  were walking around in Nazi costumes and stuff. They applied for a parade permit in Skokie, Illinois. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=807.2s)]
*  North shore Chicago, overwhelmingly Jewish suburb. Not just overwhelming Jewish suburb, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=813.36s)]
*  but particularly known for having a huge population of Holocaust survivors. People were in actual [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=817.36s)]
*  camps. So imagine the trauma for people like that to see people in actual Nazi uniforms marching [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=822.64s)]
*  through their town. People with swastikas on their, you know, arm band. Pretty heavy. Yeah. And, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  they had their permit rejected on the grounds that it was a threat to public safety or whatever, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=835.92s)]
*  but obviously it was politically and ideologically driven because the people of Skokie hated the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=839.84s)]
*  ideology of the Nazi party for obvious reasons. And the ACLU, despite being composed almost [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=844.4s)]
*  entirely of leftist Jewish lawyers and having donors that were overwhelmingly leftist Jews who [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=850.56s)]
*  were donating to the ACLU in part because they were also defending the civil liberties of [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  communists in the fifties and sixties. You know, communists were barred from becoming lawyers and [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=860.8s)]
*  being admitted to the bar because their ideology was considered to prove poor character and fitness [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  and the like. And a lot of those precedents came out of, you know, the idea that you can suppress [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=870.0s)]
*  communist speech and the ACLU fought to preserve those free speech rights. And then they did the [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=874.16s)]
*  same for the American Nazi party. That position that they took and ultimately prevailed on [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=879.04s)]
*  was something that destroyed the lives of almost every single one of those lawyers and the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=885.8399999999999s)]
*  organization. I mean, almost every Jewish supporter of the ACLU, including ones who worked there, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=890.4s)]
*  quit and discussed, turned off their donations and discussed and basically destroyed the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=895.68s)]
*  organization, came very close to bankrupting it forever. And that's what made it so interesting [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=899.52s)]
*  to me was that they were so devoted to this principle that obviously was in defense of a [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=905.52s)]
*  view they obviously found not just disagreeable, but horrific to the point where they were willing [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=911.52s)]
*  to sacrifice their careers and reputations in pursuit of that principle. And I just remember [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=916.8s)]
*  being so enamored of that posture. So they have proven that they, and even now you have like a [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  few of the remnants, you have a few of these remnants of like old ACLU lawyers, for example, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=927.68s)]
*  they represent right now the NRA because the Cuomo, the Andrew Cuomo administration, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=933.52s)]
*  sought to destroy the NRA explicitly by threatening banks, by threatening advertisers, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  by threatening anyone who's doing business with the NRA that they will have their state contracts [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=944.4s)]
*  cut off. And the ACLU, like the old lawyers of the ACLU, like the real free speech ones, looked at [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=948.0s)]
*  that and said, obviously you can't have the state government setting out to destroy a political [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=953.1199999999999s)]
*  advocacy group because of their hatred for their ideology and represented the NRA and sued the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=957.04s)]
*  state of New York and actually won on the grounds that Andrew Cuomo had violated the free speech [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=961.44s)]
*  laws. But primarily, like so many institutions in the wake of Donald Trump, they became completely [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=965.6800000000001s)]
*  corrupted in part because they were for the first time, you know, they would post like, we're going [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=972.4000000000001s)]
*  to take Trump to court on this and we're going to take Trump to court on that. And they were, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=976.6400000000001s)]
*  you know, turned into heroes. Like the ACLU had been pretty marginal, their whole, you know, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=980.0s)]
*  existence. They were flooded with tens and then hundreds of millions of dollars. And they became [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=984.6400000000001s)]
*  this very well-funded, powerful organization. And they knew that they were captured as a left [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=990.8s)]
*  liberal advocacy group solely to destroy Trump. And now essentially the entire organization is [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=996.3199999999999s)]
*  unrecognizable. You know, and you have that key event where they defended the right of Nazis or [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1001.76s)]
*  white nationalists to march through Charlottesville. They represented them. And then you had that woman [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1007.76s)]
*  who was killed by one of the parade protesters, the white nationalist protester who ran over [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1011.5999999999999s)]
*  Heather Heyer. And that caused this huge uproar in the ACLU. People who worked on like LGBT issues [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1017.12s)]
*  or like immigrant issues saying, why are we representing, you know, white nationalists and [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1023.68s)]
*  their free speech rights? And it's like, do you know anything about the organization that you [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1029.12s)]
*  actually applied for a job and then joined? But they didn't. And that was on the ACLU for the first [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1032.72s)]
*  time you're treated by issuing this memo saying in the future, we're going to weigh the value of free [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1037.12s)]
*  speech versus other political values. And so many other instances then where they've taken [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1042.72s)]
*  positions that would have been completely anathema to the ACLU. And to me, this is so [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1048.88s)]
*  illustrative of what happened to like left liberal political culture. The parts of it I used to really [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1052.96s)]
*  like is that it was renounced all in the name of defeating Trump, which in turn had all kinds of [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1057.2s)]
*  financial values and benefits and benefits and power and the like. So if you're paying any [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1062.48s)]
*  attention at all to what's going on in the world, you've probably asked yourself, what would I do, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1068.72s)]
*  not just for myself, but for the people who love me and I'm responsible for my family? What would [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1072.56s)]
*  I do if things really went south, either for a short period or a longer period? If there was an [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1076.8s)]
*  emergency, how would I respond? Well, of course, you need food and water, you need security, some [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1080.96s)]

*  But one problem you may not have addressed is what do you do about medicine? If there's a medical [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1089.76s)]
*  problem when there's not readily available medical care, what do you do for your family? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1094.16s)]

*  the people in the ACLU. Like, I don't think I want to have dinner with them. But I, like you, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1161.92s)]
*  absolutely admired, almost revered their commitment to principle. You know, I'll die for [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1166.16s)]
*  your right to say something that I hate. Right. Okay. So I love that. And I still do love it. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1172.48s)]
*  That was on the left. That was the best thing about the left, that and their anti-war instincts, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1177.52s)]
*  in my opinion. It's all gone. So it kind of migrated right and conservatives start talking [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1181.52s)]
*  a lot about free speech to my joy. And then, you know- And also criticism of the US security [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1186.4s)]
*  state are found only on the right now on the way to Trump. All of that. Like that inversion [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1192.96s)]
*  happened. But then, you know, six months ago, all of a sudden you have people on the right being [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1196.96s)]
*  like, no, well, you know, that speech is violence. You're making people threatened by saying things [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1202.72s)]
*  they don't like. It's like stealing almost word for word, the language of the, what are they used [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1209.3600000000001s)]
*  to call them? Snowflakes? Yeah. Or like the social justice war. So maybe we need hate speech laws now. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1216.48s)]
*  And then all the Republicans vote for a hate speech law. And so it is- First of all, let me [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1222.64s)]
*  just say that like, this has been there for a long time, lurking this huge contradiction in [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1226.48s)]
*  right wing politics. And I actually have done shows well prior to October 7th. There were [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1232.96s)]
*  an article as well prior to October 7th, even with my new alignment with a lot of conservatives [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1237.6000000000001s)]
*  who now appreciated my free speech advocacy and my criticism of the US security state. You know, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1242.5600000000002s)]
*  lots of people who said, like you, oh, I used to really, you know, put my trust in the NSA and the [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1247.1200000000001s)]
*  NSCIA and there was a Snowden reporting and all these other things, seeing their abuses [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1251.76s)]
*  politically against Trump that made me realize, you know, you were right. So I had a lot of new [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1256.16s)]
*  right wing, if not allies, like people who were followers of my work and readers and the like. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1260.32s)]
*  But I was always aware of the fact and even saying you have a huge Israel exception embedded [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1265.84s)]
*  within your worldview because it wasn't just since October 7th, it's been for a long time that while [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1272.32s)]
*  a lot of right wing speech has been targeted with censorship on campus, and I've been very vocal and [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1276.8799999999999s)]
*  objective with that, among the most common and frequent targets of censorship both on campus and [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1281.04s)]
*  generally in the United States have long been Israel critics, professors who have lost tenure [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1288.1599999999999s)]
*  because of it, who have gotten fired because of it. There was Norman Finkelstein who had his [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1292.08s)]
*  scholarship approved for tenure at DePaul University and Alan Dershowitz went on a jihad against him [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1295.44s)]
*  to destroy his career and won and basically made him unemployable. There was a professor at the [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1300.48s)]
*  University of Illinois in 2014, Stephen Salacia, who was given a contract for tenure, they found [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1306.16s)]
*  tweets of his criticizing very harshly Israel for its 2014 bombing of Gaza and he got fired. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1310.72s)]
*  University of Illinois had to pay him a million dollars, but they were pressured by donors and [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1318.24s)]
*  by Jewish student groups saying we don't feel safe on campus with someone who's so harshly [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1322.5600000000002s)]
*  critical of Israel. So this has been going on for a long time, this is not a new development, but [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1328.64s)]
*  since October 7th, and you know I have a lot of friends in my life who are Jewish, who [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1333.2s)]
*  but you know were either skeptical of Israel or kind of apathetic to it, who got really radicalized [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1340.0s)]
*  after October 7th. So it really, you know Israel has kind of been on the back burner for a long time, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1344.64s)]
*  so those contradictions weren't very apparent. Now you listen to the pro-Israel right and they sound [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1349.44s)]
*  and not ironically or like you know as parody or some strategic maneuver, they sound exactly like [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1356.32s)]
*  the left liberals who they've been heaping scorn on for the last decade. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1362.96s)]
*  You cannot enter a discussion with an Israel defender without them immediately accusing you [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1367.04s)]
*  of being a racist if they disagree with you. Oh you're an anti-Semite and this is one of the [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1371.28s)]
*  primary right-wing grievances against liberals for the last decade. Oh the minute you disagree [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1375.28s)]
*  with the liberal they call you a racist, they call you a bigot, they call you a you know transphobe, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1380.0s)]
*  they call you a misogynist. Try and have an argument, even like a substantive civil argument, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1383.92s)]
*  disagreement, criticize their rules just a little bit and count down the number of seconds before [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1390.24s)]
*  you get accused of being motivated by bigotry and hatred. It'll be you know seconds and these [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1394.72s)]
*  are the people who say oh I hate the tactic of accusing everyone you disagree with being a racist. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1400.32s)]
*  That's their only tactic, their go-to tactic. The minute you question like why is the U.S. financing [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1404.4s)]
*  Israel's military and its wars when it not only hurts our own country but when millions of [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1409.36s)]
*  Israelis are having better standard of living than millions of Americans. You're a Jew hater, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1413.92s)]
*  you have some kind of problem with Jews so it's the same tactic there. Do they say that to you? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1418.5600000000002s)]
*  Constantly. Being Jewish is not in any way, does not give you any kind of immunity from that [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1422.64s)]
*  accusation, like zero. Are you an anti-Semite? What? It's so crazy. Yeah I mean well it's the same [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1427.68s)]
*  thing you know it's like black you know the other amazing thing is I did a debate with Alan Dershowitz [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1436.3200000000002s)]
*  in Manhattan on Tuesday. It's about to come out which nominally was about whether the U.S. should [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1443.28s)]
*  go bomb yet another enemy of Israel in the Middle East, this one Iran, but in reality it turned into [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1448.56s)]
*  this broader debate about neoconservative dogma and he actually wants regime change [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1453.6s)]
*  and they did a vote before and after and like 70 percent of the audience was with me which was [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1458.72s)]
*  bizarre because it was the Upper West Side but the 30 percent who were not were extremely vocal both [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1463.28s)]
*  during the debate but then as I was leaving I was accosted by I would say like two dozen of them [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1468.4s)]
*  and they were hurling insults and screaming and trying to be menacing and their main argument was [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1473.68s)]
*  how can you be a Jew and say these things about Israel and I was trying to say like I don't think [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1478.5600000000002s)]
*  my being a Jew compels me to have a certain set of ideas about foreign policy or this foreign country [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1482.48s)]
*  and the amazing thing about that is there has been this sense all the time like if you you know if a [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1488.64s)]
*  liberal sees a black conservative or a gay conservative they'll immediately say oh you're [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1494.64s)]
*  an uncle tom you have some you know psychological problem that you're self-hating how can you be a [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1499.44s)]
*  black conservative how can you be a gay conservative as though being part of these you know demographic [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1503.3600000000001s)]
*  groups somehow compels you to embrace a certain political ideology like there's a relationship [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1509.44s)]
*  between your skin color and the political ideology that you have to embrace that was always some [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1513.68s)]
*  argument on the right like why just because someone's black are they automatically enslaved [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1517.8400000000001s)]
*  to the democratic party and yet so many people on the right now say oh if you're a Jew you have to [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1522.08s)]
*  have unquestioning support for Israel but like what if I don't what if I think the government [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1528.08s)]
*  of Israel is actually wrong but it's that tactic like you hate Jews or if you are Jewish you're [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1531.4399999999998s)]
*  self-hating and then the hate speech you know I've been hearing from liberals for the last decade [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1536.8s)]
*  oh yeah we want free speech but some things are over the line in our hate speech and they endanger [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1542.8s)]
*  minority groups because words are violence and words can incite violence and this has been the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1548.0s)]
*  thing that the right has been scoffing out like oh these little left-wing snowflakes on campuses [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1552.32s)]
*  want the administrators to intervene and protect them from ideas that make them uncomfortable [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1556.96s)]
*  there's nothing that we've heard other than that from the last seven months from right pro-Israel [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1561.28s)]
*  conservatives other than oh these poor little Jewish students at Harvard and Yale and Princeton [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1567.28s)]
*  who grew up extremely wealthy and go to the most elite colleges are now somehow endangered even [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1572.8s)]
*  there's no record of violence at these protests like almost none because hearing chants that are [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1577.52s)]
*  pro-Palestinian or anti-israeli make them feel vulnerable like the conservatives in congress [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1583.52s)]
*  like Elise Stefanik and Virginia Foxx all Mike Johnson they had like a horde of Jewish students [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1589.36s)]
*  from Harvard coming and saying I don't feel safe at my school the very things the conservatives [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1594.32s)]
*  have been mocking so viciously when that came from black students or trans students or immigrants or [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1599.28s)]
*  Muslims or whatever the hypocrisy the stench of it is suffocating and nauseating let's [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1604.8s)]
*  from my perspective as an American I think you're gonna have any opinion you want on Israel I'm not [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1612.72s)]
*  actually that interested I personally like Israel whatever the red line for me is this is my country [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1618.1599999999999s)]
*  my birthright is free speech God gave me that right you cannot take it away and if you're telling me [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1624.72s)]
*  what I'm allowed to say in my country you're my enemy like it's just kind of that simple [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1629.76s)]
*  you can't tell me what to say or think period because I'm an American exactly and if there but [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1634.48s)]
*  if there were a consistent standard like let's say there were consistent periods like let's just [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1638.64s)]
*  walk back from there but right if there were some consistent standard like western Europeans have [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1642.5600000000002s)]
*  hate speech laws whatever that kind of they don't really comply them consistently but at least [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1648.0800000000002s)]
*  there's like a dogma like hate speech is not part of free speech in the United States we don't have [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1653.52s)]
*  a hate speech exception the first time there is no such thing so if you suddenly now start [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1657.36s)]
*  you know and it's not just in the discourse they they're passing laws oh I'm aware like Greg Abbott [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1664.9599999999998s)]
*  issued an executive order that said there will be no more anti-Semitism meaning anti-Semitism speech [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1671.84s)]
*  anti-Semitic speech or ideas allowed in the state of Texas and you have I don't know if you saw the [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1677.28s)]
*  video this week but there was a video emerging where a school administrator went to a group of [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1681.6799999999998s)]
*  Palestinian protesters and said I just want you to know if you chant from the river to the sea [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1686.4s)]

*  conservatives is that we shouldn't have jobs set aside for certain groups we shouldn't have [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=1986.4s)]

*  about Jewish students being discriminated against because of their views or whatever and it was [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2022.56s)]
*  never really Jewish students it was pro-Israel students Jews who support the war because a lot [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2026.4s)]
*  of these protests have overwhelming numbers of Jews inside these protests yeah so it's not a [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2030.08s)]
*  hostility toward Jews hostility toward anyone who supports this war that the protesting agents [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2036.72s)]
*  Palantir announced that they were creating 180 new jobs that were available exclusively [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2041.76s)]

*  no Christians could apply no Muslims could apply no atheists could apply no black people only for [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2054.7999999999997s)]
*  Jews Ben Shapiro saw that and he went onto Twitter and above that Palantir announcement [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2059.6s)]
*  said something like wow this is fantastic and then after his own followers spent the day saying [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2066.16s)]
*  what do you mean this is exactly the thing you're supposed to oppose at the end of the day he was [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2072.64s)]
*  kind of forced to say yeah you know what maybe it would be best if it were open to everybody but [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2076.72s)]
*  then like what's the point of the announcement he would never have commented obviously he was [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2081.92s)]
*  happy about that Barry Weiss same thing you know Ms like anti-woke this is identity politics is [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2085.28s)]
*  pure as it gets creating 180 jobs solely for Jewish students and it's I think very hard to make the [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2092.32s)]
*  case that Jewish Americans are like an endangered or marginalized minority in the United States very [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2097.92s)]
*  very hard to make that case when she saw that announcement she put this like very excitement [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2103.2000000000003s)]
*  wow on top of it and so you see this like utter and complete abandonment of what these people have [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2107.6000000000004s)]
*  been claiming were their principles not even in defense of their own country or people in their [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2114.0s)]
*  own country but this foreign government in Tel Aviv and you know when you watch something like that [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2119.04s)]
*  and you see a political movement expose itself as a complete fraud now I should say there are a lot [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2126.08s)]
*  of exceptions to like hardcore conservatives like Chris Ruffo has often condemned some of these [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2130.72s)]
*  bills you have to Candace Owens has to Tom Massey in Congress has been like incredibly steadfast to [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2137.2s)]
*  the point where he packed tried to take him out and failed he just won his primary with like 76 [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2143.36s)]
*  but overwhelmingly the pro-Israel sector of the American right has proven itself to be such utter [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2147.36s)]
*  and complete frauds about virtually every value they've spent the last decade pretending to [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2153.92s)]
*  champion and believe in and it's been sickening to watch the reason it's scary is um again has [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2158.1600000000003s)]
*  nothing to do with Israel at all about which I have like less emotion than most Americans I apparently [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2166.2400000000002s)]
*  I just don't care that much either way but what's scary is if there's a an alignment [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2172.56s)]
*  between left and right which is to say everyone with institutional power [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2178.3999999999996s)]
*  on the question of speech in other words if you say something I don't like I can put you in jail [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2183.2s)]
*  then it's a totalitarian country by definition by definition there is no totalitarian country in [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2188.0s)]
*  history that has offered free speech and conversely there's no totalitarian country in history that has [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2193.68s)]
*  refrained from using censorship which is one of the reasons why it's so bizarre that if you now [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2199.76s)]
*  wave the free speech banner you're accused it's code just like fascist it's like show me the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2203.76s)]

*  of fascism to do what you're doing um but you know I do well I know and I've been attacked recently [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2212.0s)]

*  and um just asking oh you're just asking questions like well yeah you're that's kind of like important [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2224.0s)]
*  to me but here's the other thing first of all it's my job this is the other amazing part of it is like [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2230.8s)]

*  has done that has been very positive is he dragged the Republican Party away from the kind of Bush [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2240.48s)]

*  by saying like we shouldn't be focusing on all these other countries yes we should be focused on [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2252.16s)]

*  on every level and we're spending all this money to benefit other countries so the Republican Party [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2280.4s)]
*  has basically rebranded as America first you know based on the idea that our primary priority should [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2285.84s)]
*  be the people of our country and you I can't tell you how many Republican members of Congress or [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2291.12s)]

*  popular on the right and some parts of the right so here's someone who's you know a liberal who's [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2962.88s)]
*  opposed to free speech and is a liar how did she all of a sudden become it's like she's everything [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2968.88s)]
*  concerns are supposed to dislike or oppose maybe not personally she's very charming actually but [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2976.1600000000003s)]
*  like how did she become like a darling of conservatives well i think we've talked about [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2981.52s)]
*  this before but barry weiss got hired away from the wall street journal by the new york times on [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2987.36s)]
*  the same day that they also hired brett stevens away from the wall street journal and all the [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2994.56s)]
*  liberals were focused on and obsessed with brett stevens they were all up in arms and angry that [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=2999.2000000000003s)]
*  brett stevens was a climate denier and now he's gonna have the space as a new york times columnist [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3004.2400000000002s)]
*  but i was trying to get everyone to understand that the far more significant hire the far more [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3008.6400000000003s)]
*  consequential person was barry weiss because i had seen her she's extremely shrewd she's very cunning [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3013.36s)]
*  she understands how media works she's very smart and i know i've gotten to know her personally and [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3019.1200000000003s)]
*  she's impossible to dislike as a person she's like incredibly charming and and and i think like [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3024.96s)]
*  genuinely compassionate like it's you cannot dislike her as a person and that's a that's an [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3031.44s)]
*  important weapon but what the one of the reasons why she became a folk hero is because she resigned [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3036.8s)]
*  from the new york times with such a kind of denunciation of the new york times like [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3042.56s)]
*  ideological dog when there was a lot of truth to that for sure but then you know if you actually [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3046.7999999999997s)]
*  look at and i think this is one of the things that i've only become i've only come to understand [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3052.24s)]
*  recently is that there are a lot of there's been a lot of focus over the last say decade under the [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3056.56s)]
*  banner of anti-woke and that's really barry weiss's kind of brand is like i'm against woke ideology [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3063.04s)]
*  i'm against media capture by ideology and there was all this fixation on college campuses and a [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3069.36s)]
*  lot of times people like why are 40 year old pundits and journalists constantly talking [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3076.56s)]
*  about what 19 and 20 year olds are doing on on college campuses like almost not just as [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3081.6800000000003s)]
*  proportionate but a little bit creepy especially ivy league college like actually who gives a [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3086.2400000000002s)]
*  shit in a country that's dying of fentanyl ods where people are so unhappy that life expectancy [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3091.6800000000003s)]
*  is declining like we're spending a lot of time talking about columbia students exactly and like [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3097.7599999999998s)]
*  you can say well those are the future leaders and it's true i guess 19 and 20 you know how [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3102.96s)]
*  fucking stupid i was when i was 19 and 20 not as stupid as i was idealism and naivete and just like [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3107.52s)]
*  my view of the world was so simple because that's part of being young like you kind of want that [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3113.44s)]
*  youthful energy but the real reason is that the thing that is barry weiss's obviously animating [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3117.68s)]
*  cause is the cause of zionism in israel that's i don't think she would even deny that and there [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3126.16s)]
*  has been this fear on the part of the israeli government in the pro israel movement that the [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3131.2799999999997s)]
*  greatest danger the israeli causes faces is the activism of students on college campuses [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3136.16s)]
*  where it's the only place where robust criticism of israel is tolerated and it's the movement as [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3141.52s)]
*  we were describing where this boycott divestment and sanction movement has taken hold and that was [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3147.44s)]
*  in part the thing that brought down apartheid south africa which is a very close ally of both [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3152.24s)]
*  israel and the united states and they were petrified that if that took hold then that would become a [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3156.3999999999996s)]
*  very effective movement against israel weakening its position we can get standing in the world [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3161.9199999999996s)]
*  and so there were all kinds of strategic memos of saying we need to target college campuses [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3166.24s)]
*  and make sure that this is that this climate is transformed and the whole reason why people like [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3170.7999999999997s)]
*  barry weiss and bill ackman who uses his billionaire status something to become political [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3177.6s)]
*  activist focused so much on college campuses wanting professors wanting a university president [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3182.7999999999997s)]
*  inspired bill ackman led the way of saying any college student who signs an anti israel petition [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3187.68s)]
*  will be permanently blackballed and all his billionaire friends and hedge fund managers [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3193.36s)]
*  and corporate ceos and people at palantir joined in is because they identified college campuses as [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3197.52s)]
*  the place where israel criticism was bubbling over and was really being active it's the same reason [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3205.04s)]
*  that tick tock got banned you know this tick tock ban if you think about it i thought it was because [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3211.12s)]
*  of china no okay so i'm just kidding right i know so when it was first introduced that was the idea [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3215.92s)]
*  right like we can't have the chinese communist party um as though like all of that data is not [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3221.52s)]
*  available on the open market like there was a big scandal that the cia and and and intelligence [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3229.6s)]
*  communities were buying on the open market huge amounts of data about american citizens they're [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3234.88s)]
*  listening to us on this right now everything is tracked you don't why would china need to create [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3239.04s)]
*  an app to get all this flying information that they can buy from anywhere else so and at the same [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3242.88s)]
*  time like the people who run tick tock are pure capitalists like the guy who's the ceo was born [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3248.16s)]
*  in singapore he went to the london school of of economics then he went to harvard he worked for [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3253.2s)]
*  mckinsey or goldman sachs like a classic all he cares about is money but this this idea of [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3257.6s)]
*  banning tick tock has been around for four years and it couldn't get passed it was considered way [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3263.92s)]
*  too extreme like banning american citizens who voluntarily choose to use this app to find [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3268.3199999999997s)]
*  communion to spread ideas to make themselves heard to read news taking that away from them or forcing [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3276.16s)]
*  a sale was considered way too extreme and yet suddenly after october 7th instantly an overwhelming [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3282.3999999999996s)]
*  bipartisan consensus formed in order to ban it ran through congress and president biden signed it why [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3288.16s)]
*  you go to ask any one of the sponsors of this tick tock ban why it finally got enough people [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3294.08s)]
*  to support it after spending so many years not even near a majority and they will all tell you [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3299.6s)]
*  that the reason is because they became convinced that there was far too much israel criticism being [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3305.3599999999997s)]
*  permitted on tick tock that was the issue that became the tipping point for banning an app that [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3311.68s)]
*  180 million americans a third of the country voluntarily choose to use it was because of the [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3318.08s)]
*  israel issue and i think like we're required so often to tiptoe around this um you know you get [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3323.44s)]
*  accused of like pushing anti-semitic tropes that like uh jews are behind everything and just want [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3331.04s)]
*  to live in a free country just leave me alone just want to live in a free country that's it [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3337.44s)]
*  also it's not just i don't care it's not just american jews who are inculcated from birth with [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3341.52s)]
*  the idea that they have particular stuff like evangelicals is people in the national security [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3346.08s)]
*  state like this country has such a special status and it's not me like speculating that israel was [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3350.48s)]
*  the reason the people who got the bill through congress say that the tipping point was that all [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3357.2000000000003s)]
*  these members of the democratic party who previously resisted resistance to banning tick tock [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3362.96s)]
*  became convinced that that was one of the major sources that was allowing israel criticism and [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3367.04s)]
*  pro-palatinean speech meaning like lots of videos circulating about you know gauze and children [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3372.64s)]
*  dying they wanted to ban the the app or force it to be sold to a an american conglomerate that [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3377.44s)]
*  would be far more susceptible to pressure from the the administration like google and and and [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3383.44s)]
*  facebook have been to censor it that that was the reason they felt like the reason why young [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3388.72s)]
*  people turned against israel because they were getting too much information on tick tock and it [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3393.52s)]
*  was too free that should alarm everybody well it's it's again if you're an american and you just [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3396.8799999999997s)]
*  want to live in a free country that's completely unacceptable that's like there's no way to describe [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3404.3199999999997s)]
*  that is anything but a state clamped down on free speech which is not allowed in the united states [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3410.16s)]
*  that's totalitarian just super simple i'm really struck by how non-obvious that seems to be to [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3416.88s)]
*  everybody and i'm wondering like where's the you don't have a bill of rights you don't have a free [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3422.6400000000003s)]
*  country unless someone's fighting for it and i don't see anyone with power fighting for it so [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3428.88s)]
*  no i mean well it's so interesting i mean first of all i think we have to acknowledge the reason [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3433.92s)]
*  you know the founders when they created the bill of rights guaranteed rights that they knew would [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3440.56s)]
*  otherwise be vulnerable if they weren't guaranteed by the rights like that's the whole point [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3445.2s)]
*  and the very first right guaranteed in the bill of rights and the first amendment is the right of [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3449.4399999999996s)]
*  free speech that was for a reason they were kind of children of the enlightenment the idea that [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3454.08s)]
*  there's no more ability for us to put our faith in centralized authority to decree truth we were [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3458.3199999999997s)]
*  endowed with the capacity of reason and we're supposed to figure that out for ourselves without [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3464.0s)]
*  being it's so foundational to every right you are not a slave that is the marker of being a human [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3467.8399999999997s)]
*  being the right to think what you want and to say what you want if you don't have that right you [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3474.0s)]
*  are not fully human right and i feel that way as a christian i'm just gonna say i think god created [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3479.92s)]
*  people there's inherent value in every person and that's why it's so important to me it's it's it's [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3484.64s)]
*  actually bigger than america it's like are we going to treat people like human beings with dignity [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3489.52s)]
*  or we're going to treat them like objects it's one of the things that ultimately distinguishes us from [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3493.76s)]
*  other animal species exactly the reason to engage in critical analysis and so [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3498.56s)]
*  but conversely the reason that right needed to be guaranteed is because we are all tempted to look [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3506.08s)]
*  at the views we find most threatening and to hate and to want those banned and to kind of invent [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3511.68s)]
*  theories as to why they should be even if we believe that we're supporters of free speech like [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3516.88s)]
*  somehow these views that we hate most and find most threatening those are something different [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3522.16s)]
*  and you see the left having done that for the past 10 years by claiming that people who question [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3527.76s)]
*  gender ideology or inciting genocide against trans people or people who are opposed to [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3532.4s)]
*  racial reforms or affirmative action or people who hate black people people opposed to immigration [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3538.0800000000004s)]
*  hate non-white people so this is how they created these justifications for supporting censorship and [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3543.1200000000003s)]
*  now the american right i don't want to say now in the sense that they suddenly started because like [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3548.8s)]
*  i said it's been predating october 7th for a long time but that's you know i don't think it's like [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3552.0800000000004s)]
*  so conscious that oh we're political censors i think they view israel criticism as very dangerous [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3556.64s)]
*  and very threatening and they don't fight the human temptation that we all have to want the ideas that [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3562.56s)]
*  we most hate to kind of be out and if you cared about your own country comma which you run which [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3567.7599999999998s)]
*  you run you have an obligation to care about your country since it's your job to administer and run [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3574.56s)]
*  the country and preserve what we have for our children i you can't reach these conclusions [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3579.2s)]
*  like if you are an office holder in the united states you have one job and that's to preserve [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3585.6s)]
*  and improve your country and if that's not your main uh you know driving desire then you're [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3591.8399999999997s)]
*  betraying your country yeah and i mean i think first of all you know we are all inculcated with [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3599.12s)]
*  the idea from birth i know i was that the united states is the greatest country in the world it [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3604.96s)]
*  represents freedom i mean we were born into the cold war where it was really important to believe [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3609.7599999999998s)]
*  that but even after and we were given explanations as to why that was true it wasn't just you know a [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3612.8s)]
*  declaration and like one of the reasons was that we have freedoms guaranteed that other countries [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3617.52s)]
*  don't that was free countries you might when people would say exactly look and we were taught [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3622.48s)]
*  to revere the constitution and the bill of rights and all of the values that are represented so if [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3626.32s)]
*  you're willing to abandon those and sacrifice those and this is the thing it would like the left the [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3631.2000000000003s)]
*  american left has been accused of being i think quite validly embracing censorship but at least [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3637.6s)]
*  they're doing it i don't mean to justify i'm just saying distinguishing it at least they're doing it [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3644.48s)]
*  in defense of what they consider to be other americans who live here minority groups who live [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3649.04s)]
*  here and they think censorship is important to protect the ability of other americans who are [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3654.08s)]
*  part of minority groups not to be endangered there it's a totally misguided idea they exaggerate the [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3658.7999999999997s)]
*  extent to which everyone's being endangered i think racial relations on the states are better [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3664.48s)]
*  than they've ever been but that's at least their idea what the censorship we're talking about now [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3667.76s)]
*  is designed to do is to sacrifice the rights of american citizens in order to benefit this foreign [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3673.12s)]
*  country to which people in the united states have obviously more loyalty than they do to their own [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3678.56s)]
*  country and i don't just mean american jews i mean a lot of evangelicals i mean a lot of national [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3686.16s)]
*  security people and that is the part that is so bizarre and disturbing that the reverence for [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3690.0s)]
*  this foreign country i mean you can say anything you want about american leaders about the leaders [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3695.84s)]
*  of your own country you can say they're evil they're criminal they're corrupt they're [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3701.2s)]
*  they're genocidal yeah you could do any of that you cannot do that about the leaders of this one [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3706.48s)]
*  foreign country can have leaders about any other country you want just not the leaders of this one [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3712.8s)]
*  foreign country and like i said i think the time to to stop tiptoeing around that has long passed [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3716.56s)]
*  well i i agree with that and i say that as someone who spent i don't know a couple decades just sort [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3723.68s)]
*  of avoiding the topic just because i mean almost almost all my friends love israel i have no problem [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3728.7999999999997s)]
*  with that at all great love israel i mean it doesn't bother me at all um i as i've said three [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3734.0s)]
*  times and i mean it i just have great affection for the country and the people who live there i'm [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3739.7599999999998s)]
*  like hardly anti israel like not even a little bit i just care about my country and all of a [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3743.52s)]
*  sudden there's like such a massive threat to our foundational rights stemming from this issue and [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3749.2s)]
*  i think of course you've you face all sorts of i mean i've had people i know and really like and [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3754.08s)]
*  have known for decades many decades call me or text me you know you're and really attack me actually [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3760.4s)]
*  and i've always i say exactly what i'm saying to you because i mean it let me ask you do i perceive [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3767.6s)]
*  and i'm wondering if you do i do think like for the last say five or six years when you had your [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3772.64s)]
*  fox news eight o'clock show i think it's not controversial to say that you were if not i i [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3778.72s)]
*  think i would say the most popular and influential voice in american conservative politics maybe [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3786.0s)]
*  second only to donald trump and i've seen that for a long time only in the past seven months [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3791.6s)]
*  when you started expressing some dissent on this particular issue and it wasn't even anti israel [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3799.12s)]
*  it was just hey why are we doing all this for this foreign country something you've been saying about [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3803.52s)]
*  ukraine and many other countries is there a real animus for the first time among certain factions of [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3807.44s)]
*  the conservative movement in the united states including very prominent people not just to [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3815.12s)]
*  criticize you but to try and exclude you to try and destroy your reputation like we were talking [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3818.96s)]
*  about that fake report that you had launched a new show on russian tv and i watched the people who [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3823.68s)]
*  are celebrating that and spreading that they were people who a year ago would never have dared [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3828.16s)]
*  criticize you this one issue and same with candace owens who you know was incredibly popular among [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3832.0s)]
*  conservatives as well and you could point to other people too it's this one issue that can just [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3838.64s)]
*  you know be the ultimate wedge and i'm wondering if you perceive that i get you know i really try [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3844.64s)]
*  not to think about it i think um i don't want to become angry at all and i think that just being [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3849.8399999999997s)]
*  as honest as i can be i do think and i have noticed this you know if you start focusing on [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3856.8s)]
*  israel question people get really angry about this stuff really angry and it takes over their brains [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3862.5600000000004s)]
*  and i just don't want that you know i'm a i think a fundamentally happy person i have a wonderful [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3867.6800000000003s)]
*  family and wonderful friends and i live in a wonderful place and i i don't want to focus i [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3872.6400000000003s)]
*  don't want to go crazy and be like mad okay and i also don't want the concerns of a foreign country [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3877.6800000000003s)]
*  or the arguments about that country to define my views i care about where i live and my family [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3882.88s)]
*  and preserving what i grew up with and and i don't mean money i mean you know your values and your [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3889.84s)]
*  rights and your structure yeah exactly so i just have really tried to ignore it and tried not to [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3896.56s)]
*  get involved and i know that people you know love israel so much which again which does not bother [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3902.4s)]
*  me at all um but that it makes them super emotional whatever but when you start to tell [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3907.68s)]
*  me that as an american i can't say certain things in my country i won't have it i just won't have it [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3913.12s)]
*  so i just really feel like i was pushed into saying something and i also have a special concern [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3919.52s)]
*  for christians in the middle east and so i i did i've only done one interview in my life right that [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3925.6s)]
*  challenged any which was like that pastor in the west bang i know nothing i know nothing about him [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3931.68s)]
*  and you know i'm not like carrying water for him i just think it's a totally fair question to say [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3937.44s)]
*  like well how are christians doing in the middle east and the answer is not well at all and maybe [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3941.76s)]
*  we should hear from them that was total that was my only agenda right there and all of a sudden like [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3947.28s)]

*  unreasonable for me but even then i was like i'm not going to engage i don't want to have these [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3958.8s)]
*  arguments it's not worth it i've got a million different interests this is not a great interest [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3962.8s)]
*  of mine and as i've said five times i just don't care that much uh but then the speech thing when [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3966.72s)]
*  you're wrecking my country and lying constantly and encoding those lies into my laws then just [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=3972.7999999999997s)]

*  part of my life but i've never disliked elai lake so i text you like it i was like you said i hate [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4023.44s)]
*  america in this piece you've got my text of course i texted him why don't you just call me and ask me [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4028.0s)]
*  my views on america i would just tell you because i'm i think pretty transparent about my views [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4033.36s)]
*  no response i said you wrote a piece about my views when you have my text when you know me why [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4037.44s)]
*  don't you ask me what my views are i'm happy to go on the record and tell you what i think of america [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4042.1600000000003s)]

*  cause for whining at all in my life period however that's so dishonest that i just it it's like oh [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4056.96s)]
*  that's how it works but i think i think it's such an important point because uh you may have come [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4066.4s)]
*  to the obvious conclusion that the real debate is not between republican and democrat or socialist [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4071.52s)]
*  and capitalists right left the real battle is between people who are lying on purpose and people [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4076.8s)]
*  who are trying to tell you the truth it's between good and evil it's between honesty and falsehood [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4084.0s)]
*  and we hope we are on the former side that's why we created this network the tucker carlson network [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4090.64s)]
*  and we invite you to subscribe to it you go to tuckercarlson.com [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4095.76s)]

*  happens in this barn when only an iphone is running tuckercarlson.com slash podcast you will not regret [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4104.0s)]
*  it so just let me say two things on this one is i think the thing that you've talked about most [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4112.56s)]
*  on your show when you had the fox show and probably things i've talked about most too over say like [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4117.84s)]
*  the last two to three years has been the war in ukraine and for very similar reasons not because [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4122.64s)]
*  like who runs eastern donbass or the Crimea is of significance to me it's really actually not [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4128.160000000001s)]
*  me too it's because our country has become so involved in it not just with money but with like [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4134.400000000001s)]
*  our weapons and risking escalation that you feel obligated as an american given that that's exactly [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4139.92s)]
*  policymakers in washington have decided that our country that is now our war and i think that's [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4145.200000000001s)]
*  the same thing with israel it's not like i have some special i mean you know i grew up very much [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4149.84s)]

*  people i went to school with were jewish you know i consider myself a jew i think like jewish [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4160.08s)]

*  it's to me it's the same exact you know policy principles that led you to criticize the war [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4171.28s)]
*  in ukraine that have led me to criticize lots of wars including the one in ukraine but the reality [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4177.2s)]
*  is and i think this is so important is that it just is the case and as someone who grew up you [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4181.04s)]
*  know embedded in american jewish culture my grandmother fled nazi germany in the late 1930s [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4186.5599999999995s)]

*  jewish prayers and like you're in you know indoctrinated with like the principles of jewish [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4217.6s)]
*  culture american jews are told and indoctrinated from birth that one of their duties is to be loyal [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4221.92s)]
*  to and defend and protect the state of israel even if you're an american you're a jew in argentina [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4228.64s)]
*  you're a jew in wherever that is something that being jewish kind of you're told from birth [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4234.16s)]
*  obligates you to do and then recently evangelicals have also taken on this this view that israel is [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4240.72s)]
*  this country of great special you know religious and theological value and so we do have a lot of [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4247.2s)]
*  people in the united states who for various reasons have decided that this one foreign country has [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4253.68s)]
*  such great importance that if forced to choose between the two and of course we have different [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4259.68s)]
*  national interest and different strategic interest all the time that protecting and venerating and [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4265.280000000001s)]
*  elevating israel is a more important goal than even defense to our own country and that is just [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4273.120000000001s)]
*  the reality and you see it manifesting in so many ways so that the emotion and that's why people can [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4279.4400000000005s)]
*  tolerate disagreements of almost every kind you know but we lost i think like 15 to 20 percent [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4284.5599999999995s)]
*  of our subscriber base and our viewership like in the first four weeks of the after october 7th [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4291.36s)]
*  because of my position on israel and you know people say i can disagree without anything but [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4297.5199999999995s)]
*  this is the one issue i just can't tolerate like after running the opposite direction [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4301.36s)]
*  and i think it's important to acknowledge how many people are inculcated from birth to believe that [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4305.36s)]
*  and that's the thing i think is our greatest obligation as human beings why free speech is [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4311.68s)]
*  so important as well and the ability to access other information like i want to read what russia [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4315.200000000001s)]
*  is saying the eu made it illegal to platform russia state media adults in the eu even if they want to [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4319.84s)]
*  can't read russian media because now it's illegal i want to have different information sources other [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4328.320000000001s)]
*  than what my own country is telling me because one of the things you have as adult i think is [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4333.360000000001s)]
*  the greatest obligation is to go back and reevaluate what you were trained and indoctrinated [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4336.8s)]
*  inculcated to believe and not just reflexively continue to believe that in adulthood because [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4342.96s)]
*  it was indoctrinated but to reassess whether or not those really are your views as a result of [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4347.92s)]
*  your own critical analysis or whether you have different views including the role of our own [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4353.2s)]
*  country like all of these things are so important to not being a propagandized kind of automaton [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4357.52s)]
*  and it is just true for a lot of american jews that this indoctrination is so extreme [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4363.36s)]
*  i think now for evangelicals as well that it's become the paramount view like the view that [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4369.04s)]
*  subsumes every other and i think that's why when you see this conflict between [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4376.24s)]
*  a devotion to protecting the civil liberties and free speech rights of american citizens [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4381.12s)]
*  when that comes in conflict with this other goal of shielding and protecting israel so often the [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4386.16s)]
*  shielding and protecting of israel wins out even when it comes time to protect and defend [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4391.84s)]
*  the freedom that's got to be the red line and again even for people like me who you know it [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4397.360000000001s)]
*  again i don't have any problem with this road i have any problem with people who love israel [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4404.32s)]
*  people think israel's great i don't doesn't great i love other countries i love brazil i love brazil [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4407.52s)]
*  i love countries that i visit you can you can love other countries i love israel as a place to [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4412.64s)]
*  visit and i'm not against it if you don't allow me to say what i think or think what i think [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4417.12s)]
*  you are not treating me as a human being period and the defense of human dignity has to be the [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4423.5199999999995s)]
*  highest goal period and um you cannot treat me like a slave and it's just gotten to this point [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4430.0s)]
*  where yes of course obviously there are massive drawbacks uh to saying that out loud but like [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4435.5199999999995s)]
*  you don't have a choice at this point you just don't have a choice well and i also think this is [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4443.2s)]
*  what i really believe too is that you know you've obviously gotten to a place in your career where [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4447.2s)]
*  you have a lot of security where you have you know even with this descent on this issue a lot of [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4453.679999999999s)]
*  people who still listen to you and trust you and are going to pay attention to you no matter what [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4458.08s)]
*  i feel the same way i mean i've had like a success in my journalism career i'm at the point where [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4462.88s)]
*  you know i feel i don't ever feel like i need to be captive to my audience or feed them what they [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4467.599999999999s)]
*  want to hear i've always tried to cultivate an audience that knows that they can't expect to come [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4471.6s)]
*  to me and hear what they want to hear they're at times they're going to hear things that they [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4476.08s)]
*  violently disagree with and i'm always going to respect them enough to make an argument but that's [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4480.320000000001s)]
*  part of what i hope they're coming to me for but for a lot of people in journalism especially with [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4483.6s)]
*  the destruction of jobs and the erosion of job security as you know every major media outlet is [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4488.400000000001s)]
*  laying off people in huge numbers and it's kind of a collapsing industry the pressure and need to [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4495.280000000001s)]
*  conform is greater than ever because most people don't have that privilege or that security that [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4500.48s)]
*  you and i both have at this point in our lives and career and you know i can't tell you how many [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4505.2s)]
*  times during rushagate when i was as vocal of the skeptic of rushagate as i could possibly be from [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4509.5199999999995s)]
*  the very moment i first heard that script get unveiled by the cia through the new york times [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4515.679999999999s)]
*  the washington post so many journalists who work at major media outlets like cnn and the washington [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4519.759999999999s)]
*  post and um nbc news and others would write to me and say i'm so thankful for this skepticism [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4524.96s)]
*  that you're expressing and of course at some point i was like why aren't you expressing it [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4531.36s)]
*  but i know why because if they did even one time they'd become the target of the liberal mob on [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4535.52s)]
*  twitter that would put pressure on their editors to fire them they'd be the first to get laid off the [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4541.6s)]
*  last to get hired and so our journalism profession has become one where conformity is by far the [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4545.84s)]
*  highest value and i think for those of us who aren't quite as vulnerable or as insecure in [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4552.72s)]
*  terms of our you know career position or need to keep a job it's almost like you have an obligation [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4559.360000000001s)]
*  to create that space that a lot of other people can't create that's really what i feel and so [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4564.8s)]
*  no one likes having people who are your readers or your viewers or previous supporters like kind of [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4570.320000000001s)]
*  turn against you or denounce you nobody likes being called names it's not fun for anybody [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4576.0s)]
*  but you know if you're going to do a job and have some kind of meaning to it some kind of purpose to [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4580.56s)]
*  it some kind of value that it based on i feel like if you are in that kind of position you have the [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4586.4s)]
*  obligation to take those risks of course you do and to be as honest as you can be yeah and and by the [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4592.8s)]
*  way to keep to the extent that you can but try really hard every day to keep the hate out of your [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4598.24s)]
*  heart if you do find i mean there are some people i don't talk about not many thank god [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4602.8s)]
*  but there are some people i don't talk about or write about ever because i'm too mad at them and [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4607.92s)]
*  i just i don't want to feel that way and i can smell hate on other people hate is one of those [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4613.44s)]
*  words that's been weaponized and of course hate but but hate is real and we do feel it and in [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4618.96s)]
*  my religion you're not allowed to forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4626.24s)]

*  because i'm like i'm not rational because i work for him for so long and he's gone insane in my [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4645.280000000001s)]
*  opinion but on this topic like i i you're not going to stop me from saying what i think is true by [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4649.84s)]
*  accusing me of hate when i know that there isn't any hate i'm not motivated by some weird animus [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4657.4400000000005s)]

*  being secure in yourself and your own values that you don't feel like you have to prove anything or [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4670.96s)]

*  to hate and it doesn't mean like i agreed with their politics anymore than i did previously or [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4895.4400000000005s)]

*  concerns in their lives i know it sounds so simple but it's such an important lesson that [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4904.24s)]
*  to learn because our society is constantly trying to divide us and i think that's very purposeful [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4908.96s)]
*  it's what well actually the real nugget in the story is the fact that you went well why did you [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4913.36s)]
*  do that because i had been there like eight or nine months and i felt like these connections were real [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4919.44s)]
*  um i just felt you know it was almost like i had become part of this community and some of them [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4924.16s)]
*  are like around still they're like writers like some work for like conservative outlets and we [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4929.76s)]
*  always like laugh about that um but it was like my first introduction to like internet debate it [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4934.320000000001s)]
*  was at the time when the internet was still like segregated with aol or compi serve it was like [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4939.92s)]
*  that it wasn't our like interconnected internet it was like very in the incipient stages [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4943.92s)]
*  but i went because i felt like i like these people and i kind of felt like they liked me [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4948.24s)]
*  and i originally went in solely with the purpose to provoke their hatred toward me and to hate them [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4953.2s)]
*  as well that was like why i went in and just being around them daily day after day like first [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4957.52s)]
*  debating and then convert it it like made me see their humanity and they saw mine i was just as [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4963.120000000001s)]
*  anathema to them as they were to me um i was openly gay and i was a jewish lawyer and i was [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4968.160000000001s)]
*  working in manhattan and these were like evangelical like housewives or like businessmen and like you [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4973.360000000001s)]
*  know rural georgia or like idaho and i don't know i guess we just discovered each other's [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4979.6s)]
*  common humanity and it was a very transformative experience for me about how you look at other [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4987.200000000001s)]
*  people what a wonderful story well obviously in you maybe latent was like that priority other [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4991.4400000000005s)]
*  people matter more than anything yeah and i also i think that again like so much of the reason why [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=4998.56s)]
*  we end up with the political views we have like sometimes you see people with political views [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5004.8s)]
*  that you just can't comprehend you think are like malicious and destructive and insane [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5008.16s)]
*  a lot of times it's because that's what they were formed to be that's like the byproduct and [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5013.5199999999995s)]
*  of their culture and of their upbringing and if you had the same upbringing maybe you would think [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5019.2s)]
*  the same things and i think like the people who do that for a living and keep these destructive [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5023.599999999999s)]
*  ideologies those people really warrant your contempt you know like the mill crystals of the [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5029.36s)]
*  world the victoria newlands of the world like those kind of people the liz cheneys [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5033.36s)]
*  but ordinary people who don't pay much attention to politics like before i started writing about [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5038.0s)]
*  politics you know i was like just reading the new york times and the atlantic and the new yorker [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5041.2s)]
*  thinking i was like highly informed like a high and then when i started writing about politics [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5045.28s)]
*  and have like full time to go and read original documents not having information mediated anymore [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5048.96s)]
*  for me i realized like pretty rapidly like almost everything i believed about politics [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5054.16s)]
*  was based on a fraud that was not like my own you know my own process of arriving at things [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5060.88s)]
*  critically i just was stuffed with all these ideas that were not mine that i kind of passively [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5066.4s)]
*  ingested and that too was a very eye-opening experience because shocking yeah you know you [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5072.879999999999s)]
*  think you're a very smart person you think you're educated and then you realize like wow you're just [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5078.32s)]
*  as susceptible to propaganda as anybody and i do think smart people are people who believe they're [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5081.759999999999s)]
*  smarter of high verbal iq you're clearly in that category to a lesser extent i am also they are [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5086.08s)]
*  better at self-deception i think than any other group because they're smart and they read the [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5093.44s)]
*  atlantic and the new yorker and i read the new yorker i read every issue of the new yorker from [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5098.32s)]
*  1993 until 2017 right me too every issue yeah yeah and i thought it was so informed and so [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5103.28s)]
*  yeah it actually was a really interesting magazine the atlantic under mike kelly and after his death [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5109.5199999999995s)]
*  even wonderful magazine like that you know younger people won't even know what we're talking about [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5115.44s)]
*  but like magazines were the way that you sort of they were like the think pieces and they had [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5120.08s)]
*  like a bunch of different ideas and them yes i'd get on an airplane with my bag and i'd have like [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5124.64s)]
*  nine issues of you know the new yorker the atlantic i read every single word in all of them [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5129.04s)]
*  and then as i got older i realized like i had no fucking idea what was going on i was actually [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5133.36s)]
*  more misled than someone who hadn't been told anything it was coming out at cold like i was [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5142.24s)]
*  completely propagandized i didn't even know that and i thought i was a free thinker exactly i know [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5146.32s)]
*  i just had the experience i don't want to romanticize these kind of things but um i was once in [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5150.719999999999s)]
*  milwaukee and i like in a suburb milwaukee and i like i don't mean to like romanticize like the [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5156.0s)]
*  you know middle of the country diners but i was in a diner and it was right at the time that the [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5161.2s)]
*  intercept had this scandal because um they very poorly mishandled this source reality winner and [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5167.2s)]
*  unintentionally outed her but the whole story was like she had given a document trying to prove that [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5175.76s)]
*  the russians were interfering in the election and it made the front page of the new york times so [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5180.4800000000005s)]
*  these people who were sitting at this like adjacent table who were obviously just like ordinary people [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5184.96s)]
*  not like on their phone they saw the top story of the new york times and it was about this intercept [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5188.96s)]
*  story obviously they had no idea was sitting at the next table but they were really what they were [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5192.320000000001s)]
*  really saying was like yeah with all this russia stuff it's so hard to figure out what's real and [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5196.4800000000005s)]
*  what's not because it's all anonymous and it seems like it's all driven by some agenda [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5201.52s)]
*  i was like i almost know nobody who's paid to write about politics who writes about journalism [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5205.68s)]
*  who has that recognition and it's like by through that distance they're able to see things so much [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5212.72s)]
*  more clearly than the people who are immersed in it that is the that is absolutely the truth thing [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5218.4800000000005s)]
*  and the most dangerous thing because the people who are immersed in are the ones making the [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5222.96s)]
*  decisions exactly exactly exactly so um i don't even really want to get into russia i just can't [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5226.0s)]
*  resist asking you about navalny and his death that happened the day i left russia right um right [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5234.24s)]
*  before the munich security conference i know also perfect perfect timing for you and i'm literally [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5241.28s)]
*  on a plane going through serbia to geneva or wherever you know like i'm totally cut off [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5246.08s)]
*  and all of a sudden i land and my phone is just exploding you know pudin just killed navalny [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5251.52s)]
*  do what was that i mean i i actually don't have full perspective on it just because i was so far [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5256.72s)]
*  away but like what was that story well first of all you we did this on our show actually for [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5261.52s)]
*  two weeks after nabani's death it was definitively asserted over and over in the most authoritative [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5268.88s)]
*  tones on every cable channel and in every newspaper that pudin ordered nabani killed like he had he [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5275.6s)]
*  was his murderer he had ordered his death and like you know i think you talked about this before but [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5283.28s)]
*  this was at a time when the house republicans were holding up the 60 billion dollars from biden [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5288.5599999999995s)]
*  there was no reason in the world that pudin would have and by the way like you go back 20 years to [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5294.5599999999995s)]
*  every president that ever dealt with pudin starting with bill clinton going on and every single one of [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5300.5599999999995s)]
*  them has said he's an incredibly rational restrained trustworthy person it was only when he had to be [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5305.92s)]
*  turned into the new hitler did the whole thing reverse so he is obviously rational whatever else [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5312.16s)]
*  you want to say about him he's very sophisticated he's very restrained actually we can say that [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5317.04s)]
*  conclusively exactly and um so like why would he just suddenly you know tell people it's time for [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5322.16s)]
*  you to kill navalny like it never made any sense but we were just we were told this and also like [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5329.5199999999995s)]
*  we have this like cartoonish idea that he like not only is manipulating every event in the west but [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5334.16s)]
*  also every event in russia like he's it must never sleep and he must have cloned a hundred of him [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5340.4s)]
*  given how much credit he gets for having like manipulated and controlled every event in his [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5345.92s)]
*  country and in our countries but it then turned out like just you know three weeks ago this happened [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5350.48s)]
*  so many times before that the intelligence community admits that there's no evidence [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5357.2s)]
*  whatsoever that he participated in any way let alone ordered or requested or wanted navalny's [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5361.36s)]
*  death and we obviously have the you know we're always told like we have everything in the kremlin [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5367.76s)]
*  like under this microscope of surveillance and you know how many times this has happened where [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5372.96s)]
*  media outlets have made some kind of assertion no russian prisons are incredibly brutal like a lot [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5377.52s)]
*  of countries are they're very very cold they don't get good medical care so i have no it's not [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5382.72s)]
*  surprising that a prisoner put in the most brutal russian prisons would die but that's a completely [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5388.88s)]
*  different claim than what they were saying which was that putin had ordered him to killed and i [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5395.68s)]
*  if you look at how many times you know there was this like story in the new york times [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5402.240000000001s)]
*  exactly when trump was trying to withdraw from afghanistan that the cia planted with the new york [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5406.88s)]
*  times and charlie savage the claim that the russians had put bounties on the heads of american [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5411.4400000000005s)]

*  true this whole story was a fraud this was the scandal that the media drowned our politics in [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5493.84s)]
*  for three years starting with the middle of the of 2016 up until 2018 or 2019 so again i'm sorry [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5499.52s)]

*  passed over one of the most interesting moments in the last 10 years which was the hack [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5511.76s)]
*  hack i don't know what was the theft of emails from the dnc and from john pedesta's personal [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5517.44s)]
*  gmail account that wound up on wiki leaks and the russians were blamed for that i thought from the [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5523.28s)]
*  first day i don't know but i suspected that was not true what is true about that so let me just [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5527.36s)]
*  preface that because i know how people react to these things like if there's something that gets [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5533.52s)]
*  presented and then implemented as gospel and the minute you challenge it you're accused of being [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5538.320000000001s)]
*  like a crazy conspiracy theory because it's something everybody knows is true so let me just [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5543.360000000001s)]
*  say if you look at the last say 40 years of american history the one thing that is is a [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5547.4400000000005s)]
*  constant is that so many of the things we are told are not just true but unquestionably true [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5552.8s)]
*  the most consequential things end up being complete lies the claim that led us into the [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5557.84s)]
*  vietnam war that caused the senate to authorize the military force in vietnam was a claim about [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5563.84s)]
*  the gulf of tonkin that was a complete and total fabrication alive 1964 the claim about [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5568.4800000000005s)]
*  the claims that led us into the iraq war that everybody was so certain of was a complete and [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5573.68s)]
*  total lie the thing that drives me the craziest to this day that i feel has never got enough [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5578.08s)]
*  attention is that one that reporting happened from the new york post based on the documents [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5582.320000000001s)]
*  from hunter biden's laptop about what they were doing in ukraine and china everybody in the media [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5586.0s)]
*  united to say this was russian disinformation went all along that uh archive was completely authentic [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5590.88s)]
*  and had nothing to do with russia and it wasn't just information so many times were told things [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5596.96s)]
*  so definitively that end up being proven to be lies russia get another example so the question [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5601.76s)]
*  of how those documents made their way to wiki leagues obviously wiki leagues insist that they [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5606.96s)]
*  had nothing to do with the russians and didn't get it from the russians now that may be true and [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5613.68s)]
*  yet at the same time the russians say used a a middle matter yeah so wiki leagues might think [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5618.16s)]
*  they're telling the truth they might actually be telling the truth but it doesn't say that russia [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5623.280000000001s)]
*  wasn't involved their problem is is that there are a lot of people who oftentimes won't say it but who [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5626.240000000001s)]
*  in public but will tell you in private i mean like very well connected people that they [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5633.360000000001s)]
*  radically disbelieve the claim that the russians hacked it and the and the thing is erin mate is [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5638.88s)]
*  one of the best people most knowledgeable people on this but there really isn't a lot of evidence [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5645.2s)]
*  that the russians did the hacking um you know this firm that they got is a democratic party propaganda [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5650.4s)]
*  firm which is crowd strike the fbi purposely hid a lot of the information that would have been [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5656.96s)]
*  necessary to examine it i'm not saying the russians didn't hack it but i'm just saying [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5661.68s)]
*  conceptually if you don't question especially the truths that are most aggressively shoved down [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5665.92s)]
*  your throat after everything we've seen i think you're an extremely gullible person and in this [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5670.56s)]
*  case specifically there's also a lot of um holes in that story and i think the big problem and this [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5676.16s)]
*  is was always my problem with russia gate from the start was not that the trump campaign and [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5681.92s)]
*  the trump administration was being sabotaged by the u.s security state with a evidence-free [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5688.16s)]
*  uh scandal that did bother me journalistically this evidence-free assertion that [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5693.280000000001s)]
*  dominated our politics but bothered me much more was the real agenda obviously was to blame russia [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5698.64s)]
*  for everything to such an extent that the americans started once again viewing russia as this [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5705.200000000001s)]
*  existential enemy to the point where american diplomats couldn't speak with russian diplomats [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5710.240000000001s)]
*  and washington everybody was petrified of meeting with the russian because they would be accused [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5714.240000000001s)]
*  of being a russian spy you're talking about the country with the largest stockpile of nuclear [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5718.24s)]
*  weapons and i believe there's a straight line from the russia gate fraud from convincing people to [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5722.88s)]
*  feed on this anti-russian narrative to what we're doing in ukraine which is sitting on the brink of [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5727.84s)]
*  nuclear war which joe biden said has brought the the world closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5733.679999999999s)]
*  than anything since the 1962 missile miss occuba missile crisis and for some reason we're willing [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5738.639999999999s)]
*  to risk what even joe biden says is this massive risk of nuclear war that the atomic uh the bullet [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5744.48s)]
*  in of atomic scientists has said brought the world closer to midnight which is extinction level [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5751.599999999999s)]
*  catastrophe um we're willing to risk all that over what i mean it was obama who always said [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5758.32s)]
*  we have no vital interest in ukraine we obviously have no vital interest in ukraine [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5763.839999999999s)]
*  and so so much of this you know kind of deliberate intent to once again convince [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5767.52s)]
*  americans that russia was our grave enemy was the existential threat was interfering in a [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5774.08s)]
*  democracy based on so many lies had a lot of geostrategic implications and goals as well as [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5778.24s)]
*  domestic political ones what what's the truth that involved in these deaths did putin kill him [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5785.04s)]
*  i mean i can't pretend to know i know that the u.s intelligence committee the u.s intelligence [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5792.32s)]
*  agency admits he had no role in navani's death or like at least what we were told that he ordered it [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5797.2s)]
*  yeah again i think it's very possible that navani died from the kind of conditions that people often [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5802.4s)]
*  died from in prison yes those are very brutal it's extremely cold in those parts of russia yeah [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5807.839999999999s)]
*  exactly and you're not exactly like given heaters in your cells and blankets i'm sure he was treated [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5814.88s)]
*  very poorly and so you can make an argument i guess that like russia the russian government [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5820.56s)]
*  ethically is responsible for that but what we were told was that putin ordered it and that was a [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5825.120000000001s)]
*  complete and utter lies like so many of the things we were told definitively about russia and the [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5829.76s)]
*  russian government over the last you know eight or nine years it's one of the most insane [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5834.400000000001s)]
*  disinformation campaigns sustained enduring and consequential disinformation campaigns [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5838.400000000001s)]
*  that comes from the very people who insist that they are the sole guardians combating the dangers [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5843.6s)]
*  of disinformation when does america become a free and honest country again i think that there are a [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5849.52s)]
*  lot of encouraging signs even though they seem negative i love the fact for example that americans [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5859.280000000001s)]
*  hate the media and distrust the media pretty much more than any group that exists except for [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5865.76s)]
*  pedophiles and the margin is not that large i think it's incredibly well deserved like americans have [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5871.6s)]
*  an intuitive understanding that you know corporate journalism that the dominant wing of of the media [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5878.96s)]
*  has renounced their journalistic function and our propagandists they don't trust them they believe [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5885.12s)]
*  that they lie on purpose for political ends all of that is completely true so they're turning away [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5888.96s)]
*  more and more from these media outlets they don't trust them any longer they're still in you know [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5894.24s)]
*  they're they're gigantic media conglomerates as you know you work for one they have a lot of [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5898.4800000000005s)]
*  influence and power but less than they did before and again for me the cause of the free internet [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5902.56s)]
*  it's the reason why i moved my show to rumble and moved everything to rumble it's one of the [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5907.68s)]
*  few platforms truly devoted to preserving a space of free speech on the internet which for me is [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5911.76s)]
*  the biggest cause because the internet and the ability to use it to challenge establishment [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5917.280000000001s)]
*  orthodoxies to organize against corrupt power centers is for me the real cause of hope but [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5922.400000000001s)]
*  that only can happen if the internet is protected as a free weapon and that's what's being assaulted [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5929.68s)]
*  establishment sectors always know the greatest threat to them they always seek to destroy it or [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5934.88s)]
*  to commandeer it and that's what this whole fabricated disinformation expertise that appeared [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5939.52s)]
*  overnight after 2016 like these are the people who are the disinformation experts these groups [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5945.84s)]
*  that are now designed to identify disinformation that gets censored all of that is about eliminating [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5950.08s)]
*  dissent from the internet and and and disguising political censorship as some sort of apolitical [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5955.28s)]
*  expertise or science safety measure yeah online safety experts or online disinformation experts [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5962.08s)]
*  like where did this credential come from it's a it's a fake credential like but they you know like [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5968.5599999999995s)]
*  nina yankovitch is a like an online disinformation expert have you ever heard her speak like would [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5973.36s)]
*  you trust that woman to like even identify let your truth of anything let alone like a floating [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5977.84s)]
*  arbiter of what true is true and false to the point that what she decrees is false gets censored [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5983.04s)]
*  but that's the industry what really happened is in 2016 you had these dual traumas to western [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5988.24s)]
*  liberalism writ large one was the decision of the british people to leave the eu which was an [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=5995.76s)]
*  extraordinary thing for a country to do followed three months or four months later by donald trump's [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6000.639999999999s)]
*  obviously traumatic victory over hillary clinton from a liberal perspective i mean like real [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6005.679999999999s)]
*  trauma like psychologists were saying there they've been flooded with patients who are neurotic and [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6011.2s)]
*  like can't cope with reality because of their devastation that hillary clinton lost that was [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6016.32s)]
*  like a real thing and what they decided meaning like liberal western elite was that we could no [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6020.32s)]
*  longer afford a free internet because when the internet is free they can't control how people [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6025.04s)]
*  think how they behave and how they vote and that is when you can trace you can follow the emergence [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6029.679999999999s)]
*  of this extremely well-funded disinformation industry that was designed to assert an authority [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6035.36s)]
*  over controlling what information is and is an online so for me as long as a free internet [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6042.72s)]
*  continues to exist you see this all throughout the west in the democratic world people are [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6048.4800000000005s)]
*  abandoning their faith in institutions of authority and that abandonment of faith and [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6052.64s)]
*  trust in institutions of authority for me is the most promising development i think i couldn't [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6057.68s)]
*  agree with you more i would say it's followed in a close second position by the collapse of the [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6064.0s)]
*  neocon governor of south dakota christy gnome i mean i've never seen a more instant act of [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6070.8s)]
*  self-destruction so how would you describe it like give me the timeline on christy gnome who by the [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6077.84s)]
*  way is like a screaming neocon and sort of a conventional liberal posing as a conservative [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6081.68s)]
*  or whatever i mean i've had a lot of problems christian over the years makes me sad that people [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6087.68s)]
*  bought her bullshit but what happened to christy gnome makes me think that americans are really [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6091.52s)]
*  nice people actually it turns out and that was reaffirmed for me but describe what happened [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6096.16s)]
*  first of all she's always been an obvious lightweight i mean she got it like you know [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6100.799999999999s)]
*  elected to the house in south dakota working her way through the political system and then from [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6104.88s)]
*  that became governor and i think people attributed to her a lot more talent and substance because of [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6109.28s)]
*  that than she actually had so she was never like an impressive force at all she's a very like [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6115.84s)]
*  mindless kind of herd animal who just follows whatever dominant ideology she has to embrace [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6121.759999999999s)]
*  in order to advance her career but i think her calculation was this kind of culture work [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6126.32s)]
*  calculation that if she talked about what she perceives to be these like farming values that [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6133.36s)]
*  it was going to provoke the disgust and anger of the liberal elite and that conservatives would [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6140.4s)]
*  rise in her defense and say no these are the kinds of traditional values that have been lost and that [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6144.88s)]
*  the american liberal elite are too divorced from the problem is is that not putting bullets into [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6149.6s)]
*  the skulls of puppies in order to kill them because you hate them isn't just an liberal elite value [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6156.56s)]
*  one of the things that has happened is that americans love their dogs for a lot of really [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6162.88s)]
*  interesting reasons i think it gives people a sense of spirituality of connection all the things that [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6166.56s)]
*  have been lost when you know when we now live in cities and work in cubicles like people crave [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6170.88s)]
*  this kind of connection people don't have children they don't like across the political spectrum and [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6176.16s)]
*  dogs open people up people dogs have evolved to love and be loyal trusted companions of humans [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6180.48s)]
*  and humans to dogs the very deep bond developed over thousands of years of evolution so there's a [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6187.76s)]
*  lot of things she could have done that might have worked in that way but talking about how she pumped [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6194.0s)]
*  this puppy's skull full of bullets because quote i hated that dog is something that provoked almost [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6199.12s)]
*  universal contempt and that was gave me a lot of optimism and it was even a worse story like if [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6206.16s)]
*  you listen to her her audiobook she has an audiobook where she tells the whole story she [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6210.88s)]
*  shot the dog but didn't kill it she had to go back to her truck while the dog was suffering and [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6216.4s)]
*  from a wound she had to then kill it with a second shot she then took a goat like minutes later that [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6220.48s)]
*  she also hated because she said it smelled and was mean put him in the same gravel pit and murdered [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6226.08s)]
*  him and then she tells the story that her brother and her uncle or i think that's two close relatives [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6231.36s)]
*  said when she came back we heard about this like rampage of animal slaughter that you went on we're [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6239.759999999999s)]
*  going to get out of here before you shoot us and this was in her book that she read in her own voice [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6245.5199999999995s)]
*  like even the members for her family thought she was like a psychopath to the point where she was [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6250.24s)]
*  being endangered they were in they were endangered because she was off on some like murderous rampage [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6254.719999999999s)]
*  and how she thought that that would engender any sympathy for her of any kind rather than [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6260.72s)]
*  making her look like this deranged monster is completely beyond me well she was trying to pose [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6266.72s)]
*  as some sort of rural exactly exactly and as someone who actually has bird dogs and hunts them a lot [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6274.4s)]
*  it was preposterous like she's no idea what she's talking about she shot the dog she killed her own [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6282.16s)]
*  puppy because the dog chased and killed chickens now it's a bird dog right chickens are birds it's [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6286.56s)]
*  instinct is to do that of course you get those dogs of course and and the idea that this is like [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6292.56s)]
*  common in rural america it's shooting a bird dog it's defamation against farmers like no farmers [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6298.320000000001s)]
*  just go around like repeatedly murdering their dogs the minute that they don't like their [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6304.400000000001s)]
*  personality she could have obviously given it away to all kinds of animal rescue groups there [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6307.76s)]
*  were all sorts of things she could have done but i i do think it was that calculation but it was [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6311.76s)]
*  a huge miscalculation i do think there's like this legitimate conflict between you know east [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6316.4s)]
*  coast cosmopolitan liberals and people and like more traditional farming communities and that [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6321.12s)]
*  that's a real issue um but it's not about murdering your dogs um and then so it's it's [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6326.4s)]
*  it's cruelty masquerading as strength well i think cruelty is not strength strong people are not [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6335.839999999999s)]
*  cruel at all why would they be strong people are compassionate actually right i think we need to [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6342.96s)]
*  inflict gratuitous suffering or death on others is a sign of extreme physical and moral weakness [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6350.0s)]
*  and this is why you see all these people in washington neocons like bill crystal and david [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6357.76s)]
*  from but then also like people like glenzy graham and you see this in the british commentariat where [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6362.96s)]
*  you know they had this empire that they've now lost there's this like weak broken [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6368.48s)]
*  impotent irrelevant marginalized empire and they speak about the glories and importance of war more [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6372.799999999999s)]
*  than anybody because it's a way that they feel strong and purposeful and you have all these [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6379.28s)]
*  people in washington who constantly whatever war is proposed immediately embrace it because it's a way [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6383.599999999999s)]
*  that they get to feel strong themselves like compensating for the internal weakness and cowardice [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6391.839999999999s)]
*  that they have i mean if you live your whole life and you never display moral or physical courage [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6396.8s)]
*  you know that about yourself it pains you and instead of then doing something that requires [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6401.84s)]
*  courage you instead send other people to go risk their lives in a war that you cheerlead [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6407.2s)]
*  it's like such a psychologically warped way of finding it's like stolen valor it's it's a it's [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6413.6s)]
*  it is obviously current courageous to go and fight in war for cause but not to send other people to [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6419.12s)]
*  fight in a war for cause that requires no courage at all but that is the kind of courage that in [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6425.6s)]
*  washington people constantly embrace in lieu of actual courage it's really like a psychological [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6430.72s)]
*  pathology and it's so transparent the weaker the leader the more arbitrary and cruel to other [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6436.64s)]
*  people the leader is yeah and you see it on the interpersonal level too like the way you know [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6443.200000000001s)]
*  people who treat people who have less power than them who have less influence in them who have less [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6447.120000000001s)]
*  control there are a lot of people who abuse those kind of people and it's almost always because [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6452.88s)]
*  those people are weak and that's the way they feel strong people who are secure in their own [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6456.32s)]
*  strength create everybody as you say compassionately i think that extends to animals as well how many [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6460.24s)]
*  dogs do 26 at home and then realizing that that was unsustainable we then started this [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6465.28s)]
*  shelter where we have another like 200 or so um why do you have so many dogs it just happened [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6471.92s)]
*  organically i mean both my husband and i love dogs we started rescuing dogs and then you know [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6478.72s)]
*  i remember when we had five we were like no five's our limit and then like you know someone calls [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6483.68s)]
*  up and says oh i just found two dogs that were hit by a car on a street and they need you know [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6488.240000000001s)]
*  surgeries or they're going to die they're suffering and we were like okay let's let's take those [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6493.84s)]
*  because what's different between five and seven and then you're like at seven and you're like yeah [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6497.76s)]
*  what's different between seven and nine and then that's how you get to 26 dogs but you know there's [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6501.68s)]
*  they're all rescue dogs they're all dogs who have been found on the street by us usually but also by [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6506.88s)]
*  friends who were in various states of distress lots of them have been abandoned they're like [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6511.2s)]
*  you know petrified and traumatized and abused and when you have you know the ability of like the [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6516.64s)]
*  blessing of financial security you can use it for pure material consumption just buying more things [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6524.96s)]
*  you know trying to get another house a private plane whatever um honestly it just provides me [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6530.72s)]
*  with no happiness or satisfaction at all it really doesn't it just doesn't do anything for me [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6536.16s)]
*  and the ability to use it to help those in need um gives me so much more happiness and gratification [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6542.24s)]
*  you can almost say it's like a selfish endeavor because it just provides me a happiness that other [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6550.24s)]
*  things don't and you know also like when you have a shelter there's nothing more beautiful than [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6554.4s)]
*  connecting a dog with a family and then hearing like three months later about how the dog is [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6561.12s)]
*  integrated into the family's life and seeing pictures of that dog laying on a sofa you know [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6565.28s)]
*  with this family when they had been on the streets of Rio de Janeiro like virtually dead from starvation [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6569.84s)]
*  or from disease and you nurse them back to health and then you place them in a family like you have [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6574.5599999999995s)]
*  to figure out what are the things that actually give you meaning and purpose and happiness in life [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6579.12s)]
*  and often nominees are not the things that society tells us are the things we should strive after and [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6582.639999999999s)]
*  that was a lesson I had to learn by chasing all the things that society teaches you you're supposed [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6586.8s)]
*  to chase and then when I grabbed them and I thought it was going to make me happy and found [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6591.92s)]
*  it actually made me more vacant and emptier than I knew that I had to find the things that actually [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6595.84s)]
*  gave me happiness I think it's one of the most important lessons you can learn how old were you [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6601.84s)]
*  when you made these realizations I mean I always loved dogs like when I was young like we had these [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6607.36s)]
*  two dogs that live next door and I was like get home from school and the first thing I would do [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6612.96s)]
*  is look for them and call them and they would hang out in my house and I remember they just opened [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6616.4800000000005s)]
*  things up for for me and so well but it was really like in my late 30s and early 40s when I had like [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6620.56s)]
*  professional success and financial stability and none of that was you know my work was known and it [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6627.360000000001s)]
*  wasn't really providing a lot of personal happiness and so I was like I don't want to keep chasing [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6632.8s)]
*  after things that don't actually provide me happiness even if society respects those [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6637.92s)]
*  that we started being open more to the things that gave us happiness and like ultimately I'll [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6643.200000000001s)]
*  tell you this quick story which is I never wanted to be a father ever it was never part of my [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6650.0s)]
*  identity I never thought I would be a good father I hate imposing authority on other people I hate [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6654.96s)]
*  up telling other people what to do and my husband's like was always like being a dad was his dream it [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6659.76s)]
*  was who he was and he spent years like convincing persuading cajoling pressuring manipulating me to [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6665.44s)]
*  want to adopt kids we would go out to dinner and coincidentally there would be a couple at the next [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6671.28s)]

*  but that's the reason why if you see cruelty to animals not just dogs it's the thing that like [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6753.280000000001s)]

*  something in us that makes us feel an extraordinary empathy to them and to me they're like the thing [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6768.16s)]
*  one of the most beautiful things the planet has to offer and especially dogs I mean I don't I [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6772.96s)]
*  don't think we understand why dogs are here why we have this relationship with them dogs are the only [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6776.64s)]
*  carnivore capable of killing people that people have ever domesticated and that domestication [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6783.36s)]
*  occurred like much earlier than we ever thought right I think at the beginning of recorded [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6788.64s)]
*  history uh-huh and like you see those old fossil drawings of like man and dog 100 yeah and what [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6792.08s)]
*  you know it does make you think that there's some purpose some supernatural element here like what [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6799.4400000000005s)]
*  is that I mean that's the thing is you know I've seen just over and over and over not just in my [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6804.56s)]

*  obviously you you know they perceive things physically that we can't perceive they hear [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6819.2s)]
*  sounds that of course we can't they anticipate things they feel things in the atmosphere that [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6822.88s)]
*  are threats and react to them before we even know that they're here so we know they have [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6826.8s)]
*  perceptive abilities that human beings don't have proven by quote science yeah I mean yeah but I'm [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6830.16s)]
*  saying even emotionally like you can deceive another human about the state of your emotion [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6834.400000000001s)]
*  so much more easily than you can deceive your dog like your dogs know when you're sad they know [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6840.5599999999995s)]
*  when you're happy they know when you're excited in a way that you can't hide that from them like [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6845.04s)]
*  they just perceive it they're so connected to you and obviously there's the whole thing about [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6849.12s)]
*  teaching about unconditional love and loyalty that we can learn from dogs as well um but yeah you [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6853.5199999999995s)]

*  things at this point that can unite everyone in America all Americans independent of political [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6863.5199999999995s)]
*  ideology or socioeconomic background or anything else and the fact that she was so cruel to this [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6869.68s)]
*  dog created a revulsion that transcended almost every single category she really united people [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6875.52s)]
*  in contempt for what she had done and I found the ability of dogs to do that so fascinating [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6882.240000000001s)]
*  it's one of the one of the great joys in life I've experienced it you know really intensely [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6888.08s)]
*  let me just ask you about Brazil so you have this kind of uh fearlessness about you [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6893.4400000000005s)]
*  that puts you in these coalitions for a time and then you sort of you're abandoned by them and [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6901.6s)]
*  attacked by former allies whatever but you're in this weird position where you're living in a [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6907.04s)]
*  country that would the former president gerbil sonoro at one point threatened to put you in prison [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6911.120000000001s)]
*  and now lula is running your country I guess sort of at least in name in name [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6915.52s)]
*  and there's a very left regime in charge left whatever that is but you know globalist type [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6927.68s)]
*  government how has life in brazil changed under this new government and how has it affected you [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6935.120000000001s)]
*  you so there's this phrase brazil is not for amateurs which is basically designed to indicate [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6941.2s)]
*  that there's really oftentimes no ideology or no like obvious political alliances is very [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6949.5199999999995s)]
*  transactional usually the people running brazil are not the president or the elected officials [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6954.48s)]
*  or these permanent power factions similar to in washington and you know my I never wanted to be [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=6959.12s)]

*  he was basically imposing authoritarianism and tyranny against bolsonaro and his movement and [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7307.4400000000005s)]
*  this was a guy who because he was on the center right was hated by the left for years you know [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7313.4400000000005s)]
*  as a racist fascist all the things they call people when they hate them but he became through [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7317.84s)]
*  this consolidation of judicial power and his use of it in ways that are classically authoritarian [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7322.72s)]
*  as a hero of the left and the number one figure of the hated right and i was the one of the only [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7329.04s)]
*  people who was not a bolsonarista who was not on the bolsonar right to speak out and i didn't just [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7334.0s)]
*  speak out i mean i denounced it constantly i'm a columnist with the biggest brazilian paper i was [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7339.2s)]
*  using my column to just attack him constantly and he was the same kind of hero as that prior [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7343.6s)]
*  judge was who had the anti-corruption probe who's reporting we were able who were able to use our [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7349.200000000001s)]
*  reporting to expose and so overnight i started to become an enemy of the left and made a lot of new [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7353.92s)]
*  friends among bolsonaristas including the ones who are trying to imprison me just two years earlier [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7360.56s)]
*  and i have to say like you never really think you're going to see actual tyranny [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7366.400000000001s)]
*  and this is the closest i've ever gotten like you have we've had authoritarian [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7373.280000000001s)]
*  uh things in the united states that have happened it's what impelled me to write about journalism [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7377.84s)]
*  the abuses of civil liberties after the war on terror in the name of terrorism but nothing like [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7381.92s)]
*  a figure of this sort and this is the first time in my career as a journalist where i ever had [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7386.88s)]
*  a fear of what would happen if i actually criticized this political figure and you know [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7394.96s)]
*  you're living in a repressive regime when you feel a fear even somebody like myself who has a lot of [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7399.679999999999s)]
*  protection a lot of platform a lot of like international notoriety but i really did worry [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7405.76s)]
*  about what would happen if i was going to criticize him because other people who did were punished and [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7411.12s)]
*  put into prison um and i've been doing it very vocally and and loudly since they've attacked [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7415.5199999999995s)]
*  similar people he opened a criminal investigation into michael schellenberger [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7421.12s)]
*  and the journalists who did the brazil twitter files they they actually opened a criminal [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7424.8s)]
*  investigation into them they've never done it against me i think again because i have a certain [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7429.68s)]
*  kind of platform and protection including the fact that the current president of brazil is out of [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7434.72s)]
*  prison because of my reporting something he's often publicly stated the minute he got out of [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7439.76s)]
*  prison the first person he called when he got home was me to thank me for everything i had done so i [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7444.72s)]
*  think it's very difficult to do that but again like if you have that kind of platform i think [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7449.28s)]
*  you're obligated to use it in ways that other people can't because of their fear because if [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7453.2s)]
*  you don't then who will um who is the judge the alessandro de marais is his name it's the person [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7458.5599999999995s)]
*  that eon must begin attacking because you know rumble which is where my show is is no longer [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7465.28s)]
*  accessible in brazil unless you use a vpn i can't watch my own show in brazil because if you try [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7472.32s)]
*  and access rumble in brazil you'll get a thing saying this site is blocked because of how many [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7477.28s)]
*  censorship orders rumble was getting from the brazilian courts that they refused to comply with [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7484.16s)]
*  and that was what elon must vow to do was he said we're getting so many unjust censorship orders [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7488.8s)]
*  that we're going to refuse to obey them even if it means we get kicked out of brazil now he didn't [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7493.92s)]
*  follow through on that but the fact that he made that a scandal he talked about this judge alessandro [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7498.08s)]
*  de marais being this kind of like repressive figure um created a kind of debate that was [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7503.92s)]
*  well needed um but twitter didn't end up following through they actually ended up saying no no we [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7509.6s)]
*  will obey all the censorship orders in order to stay in brazil but uh you know this is real [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7516.24s)]
*  repression but it's not a left wing kind of oppression it doesn't come from lula this guy [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7522.64s)]
*  is not a leftist what he is is part of that establishment power that was fearful of and [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7526.72s)]
*  contemptuous of bolsonaro and used authoritarian power to stop the bolsonaro movement to protect [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7532.56s)]
*  establishment authority very very similar to what's happening in the united states with respect to [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7537.6s)]
*  trump and his movement how long can you stay there i mean i'm going to stay in depth i mean again my [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7542.0s)]

*  most important to me um and i feel like the work i'm doing is in defense of a country that i want [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7562.48s)]
*  to be free because that's theirs um i'm not saying there's never anything that could force me to leave [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7567.76s)]
*  brazil if i really felt an immediate imminent threat to my personal safety or my family's [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7573.5199999999995s)]
*  who knows but if you if you find yourself running away from those kind of fears [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7579.76s)]
*  it defines the person that you are i completely agree and as you as you said correctly you know [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7585.52s)]
*  you can't face yourself if you know that you're a coward on the other hand brazil i think is a [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7591.52s)]
*  wonderful country for the record is also the kind of country where they could you know have you [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7596.400000000001s)]
*  killed to make it look like crime yeah and i mean you know obviously during the snowden reporting [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7601.04s)]
*  we took a lot of precautions because we had an archive that was the most valuable archive not [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7605.6s)]
*  just to the u.s government but to every other government on the planet and to all kinds of [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7611.2s)]
*  non-state actors i would carry around with me on my backpack the archive on thumbnails because i [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7614.5599999999995s)]
*  didn't want to leave them at home that contained you know some of the most sensitive documents [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7619.599999999999s)]
*  that exist on this planet there were obviously a lot of security risk at the time we had to have [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7623.92s)]
*  security at our house constantly security everywhere we left same thing when i was doing [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7628.24s)]
*  the reporting that freed lula from prison we had constant threats to our physical safety i couldn't [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7631.92s)]
*  leave the house about armed guards neither could my husband or my kids so you know i don't just walk [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7636.0s)]
*  around freely on the street because i realize that there are threats that but i'm not paranoid about [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7641.6s)]
*  them i don't want to turn our house into a fortress but you know you take precautions against them but [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7647.2s)]
*  there's never risks that you can completely eliminate do you think that to my last question [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7652.32s)]
*  do you think this the authoritarianism that's obviously descending on the world [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7658.96s)]
*  is it a permanent state is this accelerating or is this just a sort of an interlude that we're going [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7666.4800000000005s)]
*  to laugh about ruthfully in 10 years well this is what the point i always make you know because i [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7671.6s)]
*  talk a lot about on my show which primarily has an american audience about what's happening in brazil [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7677.2s)]
*  and i stress the reason they should care isn't just because brazil is this very large country with [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7682.4800000000005s)]
*  huge resources and a lot of importance on the geopolitical stage the second largest in our [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7688.48s)]
*  hemisphere which would be reason enough it's because the united states is on exactly the [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7693.04s)]
*  same trajectory maybe just a couple steps behind and what all of these countries in the democratic [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7698.24s)]
*  world are doing in western europe in canada you know it's just in canada because there's this [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7703.28s)]
*  shockingly repressive law that provides for prison sentences for hate speech on the internet prison [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7709.2s)]
*  up to seven years yeah and and actually if you're accused of inciting or defending genocide you can [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7715.04s)]
*  be put into prison for life under this bill i mean this bill is shocking i went to canada [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7719.919999999999s)]
*  to do events against the central law not because i'm canadian or care about canada because what's [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7725.44s)]
*  happening is every one of these countries is using the other as a laboratory for how far they can go [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7730.08s)]
*  so every time one country takes another step toward consolidating control over the internet [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7735.5199999999995s)]
*  and what can and can't be said that shows other countries the space that they now have to go [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7740.24s)]
*  forward as well it's completely interconnected every time the eu or the uk or ireland or canada [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7745.679999999999s)]
*  or brazil take steps forward to consolidate censorship control over the internet the norms [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7751.36s)]
*  change exactly and it completely transforms what the population comes to think is normal [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7756.639999999999s)]
*  again though is it inexorable this move toward 1984 [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7763.2s)]
*  the internet is such a fascinating innovation because it has such a dual edge potential on the [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7767.6s)]
*  one hand it can be this unique and unprecedented tool of emancipation and liberation that was its [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7773.76s)]
*  promise and potential on the other hand it can also be a tool of unprecedented coercion and control [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7780.56s)]
*  because if it is no longer free if it can be used as a method of ubiquitous surveillance [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7786.64s)]
*  and information control i think it can become a closed system that is almost impossible to work [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7792.5599999999995s)]
*  your way out of and that's why to me there is no more important battle than keeping the internet [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7797.44s)]
*  free free in terms of privacy and free in terms of speech because it is increasingly the only way [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7802.4s)]
*  that we really communicate and spread ideas with one another does ai technology make that more or [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7808.0s)]
*  less likely to happen i think it makes it a lot more likely to happen and that's why it was so [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7813.44s)]
*  alarming to see those original versions of ai like chaff gpt that obviously had all kinds of political [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7818.4s)]
*  ideology imposed on it where you couldn't even get factual answers to certain questions because the [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7825.36s)]
*  designers of chaff gpt wanted ideological lines to supersede factual accuracy and so you would ask [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7830.24s)]
*  questions of it and the answers that you got were completely dependent upon the ideological [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7839.68s)]
*  perspective of those who had designed it and i found that extremely alarming [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7844.24s)]
*  is there any indication that that's going to change i mean again it goes back to what we [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7848.64s)]
*  talked about a little bit earlier which was which is that i think there is this extreme [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7855.84s)]
*  unrest and dissatisfaction on the part of populations in western governments that even [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7861.28s)]
*  if they don't follow politics closely even if they're not very engaged in the political [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7866.72s)]
*  politics closely even if they're not very engaged it's amazing that the biggest voting [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7871.28s)]
*  block in the united states are people who just don't vote choose not to vote because they don't [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7876.639999999999s)]
*  think it matters one way or the other and on some level they're probably right about that [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7880.0s)]
*  but even people who aren't very politically engaged have this intuitive sense that there's [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7884.48s)]
*  just something deeply corrupt about power factions and institutions of authority and i think that [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7888.96s)]
*  kind of dissatisfaction that is being exploited by some clever politicians in positive ways or [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7896.64s)]
*  in negative ways is obviously a prerequisite if everybody is content and happy and believes [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7901.84s)]
*  they're free and that things are going well then it's impossible to get people to uprise and change [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7907.360000000001s)]
*  but when they start really believing that things are radically awry that's why there's all these [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7912.400000000001s)]
*  politicians who have nothing in common other than the fact that they promise to hate and wage war [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7919.280000000001s)]
*  against the establishment forces that are controlling people's lives and people want those [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6kEK02_V4&t=7923.52s)]
