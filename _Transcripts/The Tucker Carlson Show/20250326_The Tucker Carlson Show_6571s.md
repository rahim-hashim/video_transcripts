# Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong: You’re Being Lied to About Cancer, How It’s Caused, and How to Stop It
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8)
*  Dr. thanks a lot for coming on so you spent your life [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=0.0s)]
*  You know 50 years [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5.0s)]
*  working on treatments for cancer and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  When you started it seemed like we were moving in the West toward the elimination of cancer [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=11.72s)]
*  Smoking was a huge emphasis get rid of tobacco and cancer rates will drop [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=18.2s)]
*  Okay, obviously smoking does cause cancer [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  And we got rid of it basically but cancer rates went up [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=26.12s)]
*  And that is a very rarely remarked upon mystery that really bothers me [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=30.0s)]
*  Tell us since you you know you made billions of dollars selling your companies, but you're still involved in medical research, which I admire [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=35.88s)]
*  Where are we now with cancer? What are you seeing in cancer rates? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Well [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=60.0s)]
*  Which were really worrisome to me now is not just the rate but the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=66.72s)]
*  population in which is increasing i.e. the younger people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=72.08s)]
*  So we clearly seen an increase in certain types of cancer like pancreatic cancer ovarian cancer [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=75.48s)]
*  And we seeing that go on cancer and we seeing it in younger people [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=83.08s)]
*  Just to set a baseline, what's the 10-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=87.82000000000001s)]
*  It's horrible. I think you know if you have pancreatic cancer today [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=92.14s)]
*  I don't think there is a 10-year survival rate so to speak [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=95.58s)]
*  Yes, what there is however if you have patients who are what we call failed all standard care [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=98.66s)]
*  The survival rate is in months you measure it in two months. Yes, that's certainly my understanding having watched a lot of people die of it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  so [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=111.86s)]
*  So advanced pancreatic cancers at death sentence, where are you seeing it now? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=113.86s)]
*  Well, I got to tell you a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=121.14s)]
*  Really concerning story is not only I'm seeing that now [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=123.58s)]
*  I'm seeing that in younger people and for the first time in my career, you know when I left UCLA [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=126.98s)]
*  I was doing all the whipples which is a surgery to actually remove most of the bankers a very big operation [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=134.34s)]
*  Your surgeon this one I'm a surgeon [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=139.78s)]
*  Yes [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=141.52s)]
*  And I was also doing pancreas transplants for type 2 diabetes and islet cell transplants and stem cell transplant [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=141.74s)]
*  So I had this diverse activity as a UCLA system professor [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=148.3s)]
*  but I never saw pancreatic cancer in children and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=154.06s)]
*  The greatest [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=159.54s)]
*  surprise [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=161.54s)]
*  To me was a 13 year old with metastatic pancreatic cancer that the family called us [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=162.98s)]
*  to help [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=169.36s)]
*  And to me that was not only devastating it emphasized the idea that we seeing people with higher incidence of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=171.4s)]
*  pancreatic cancer and younger right now in our clinic we have [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=179.4s)]
*  45 year old 50 year old [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=184.0s)]
*  And [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=187.08s)]
*  What was sad about this young boy [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=189.24s)]
*  By the time he came to see us he had exhausted all standard of care [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=191.84s)]
*  And he came from Butler, Pennsylvania [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=196.76s)]
*  and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=199.96s)]
*  all the major medical centers really [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=200.96s)]
*  Had exhausted all the therapy by the time he came to see us his body was written and he passed away [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=204.16s)]
*  so [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=212.08s)]
*  seeing cancers now in younger people and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=213.68s)]
*  almost a rise almost [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=218.12s)]
*  Like I don't know call it a non infectious pandemic [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=220.96s)]
*  But this is what I think is gonna the worrisome in the world not just in United States, but largely in the United States [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=224.4s)]
*  We're being to see this and it's really worrisome a non infectious pandemic of cancer including deadly cancers, correct [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=230.76s)]
*  like pancreatic [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=239.0s)]
*  In in your career, which I think is about 50 years of working on this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=241.08s)]
*  How many 13 year old pancreatic cancer patients have you seen never never? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=245.52s)]
*  I inquired around because it bothered me so much now [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=251.08s)]
*  Why this is happening [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=256.88s)]
*  so [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=259.04s)]
*  Dr. Stephen day was a good friend who was true trained with me at UCLA when I was at UCLA [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=260.36s)]
*  He's now at the Angeles Clinic and I called him and he said listen Patrick [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=266.96s)]
*  I'm now seeing an eight year old a ten year old an 11 year old with colon cancer. We've never seen colon cancer [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=271.04s)]
*  We've never seen that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  We've seen now 30 year old 40 year old ladies young ladies with ovarian cancer [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=280.2s)]
*  so this is a real phenomenon of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=285.92s)]
*  Arise of cancer in early people in young people and oh in and and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=288.96s)]
*  Really need to get to the bottom of that. Do you notice a difference in? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=295.44s)]
*  the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=299.92s)]
*  virility of the cancer of the speed with which it moves [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=301.12s)]
*  Well, I'm getting reports with they've even called it turbocharged [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes, I said that right I'm getting reports of that now that people that have been in remission before even are now getting [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=306.92s)]
*  Back to cancers and very rapidly progressing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  So if you really think about what the cause of cancer is, you know, and I did a piece with Sanjay Gupta [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  Many many years ago on 60 minutes and I said, you know the cause of cancer is its inability [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=326.32s)]
*  It's not the rapidity of its growth, but it's inability to die and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=332.04s)]
*  Its inability to die is because it either hides from the cells that matter [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=336.56s)]
*  I your natural killer cells your T cells [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=342.32s)]
*  Or and this is what I'm really worried about [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=345.6s)]
*  Your body and the cancer has found a way to support [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=349.6s)]
*  And the cancer has found a way to suppress your killer cells [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=353.44s)]
*  And once they do that once they activate what you call the suppressor cells [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  And you call yourself immunosuppressed and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=365.52s)]
*  Then I think you see this rapid progression because there's nothing stopping [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=369.84s)]
*  What could possibly be causing this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=376.88s)]
*  Well, I think if you look back [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=379.88s)]
*  Of causes, you know, ironically when I was doing at UCLA [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=382.92s)]
*  I was working on pancreas transplant where I want to immunosuppress the patients [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=386.68s)]
*  Yes, you have to yeah [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=391.16s)]
*  Because you prevent and then I was working on cancer where I don't want to immunosuppress [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=392.68s)]
*  So I needed to understand the body's mechanism and we have a crazy [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=398.08s)]
*  wonderful exquisite balance in our body [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=405.64s)]
*  You have the yin and the yang of the killer cells [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=408.12s)]
*  And these things called natural killer cells and T cells [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=412.44s)]
*  Whose job is to kill anything that threatens the body? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=416.44s)]
*  Its job is to kill [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=419.47999999999996s)]
*  Quite right anything that threatens body whether you the body has infection if you have TB you have HIV if you have [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=422.28s)]
*  Hepatitis you have covered [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=431.0s)]
*  These cells are there to recognize [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  These cells are there to recognize [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=435.64000000000004s)]
*  These infected cells and kill it as you and I are sitting here today [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=438.32s)]
*  Our stem cells are growing in order to replenish [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=443.36s)]
*  Parts of your body your heart if you didn't have that you wouldn't have a heart at age of 14. You need those stem cells [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  but mathematically [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=453.48s)]
*  There are some cells that transformed and your body recognizes that through these natural killer cells and kills it [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=455.6s)]
*  I call that nature's first responder [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=461.24s)]
*  That's your mechanism that's how we are all protected and we are in the state of equilibrium or balance [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=466.20000000000005s)]
*  on the other hand the moment [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=472.6s)]
*  either the tumor find a way to hide from these cells or [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  your bodies or the tumor causes these cells to be suppressed and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=479.48s)]
*  That's why I call this suppressor cells and there are certain cells in your body [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=486.48s)]
*  Called T. Rake cells or myelodirve suppressor cells. They is all technical [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=490.68s)]
*  And when they get upregulated [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  You've lost your protection [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=498.76s)]
*  and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=501.48s)]
*  So the question then is how do we understand this balance? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  How do we increase the killers and how do we decrease the suppressors? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=506.52000000000004s)]
*  So that's been 50 years of my challenge of and how do we expose the tumor? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=510.44s)]
*  So on the one hand you need to expose the tumor because it hides from the killers [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=517.4s)]
*  And then you activate the killers and the other hand you have to suppressor suppressors [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=522.08s)]
*  so we truly bring a good game of chess and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=526.52s)]
*  I think like a [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=530.6s)]
*  Astrophysicist where you're looking for God's particle where all these molecules are [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=533.2s)]
*  floating around talking to each other all the cells are floating around talking to each other and this dynamic interaction and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=537.8000000000001s)]
*  How do you understand all of that, you know one of the best most fun lectures I gave [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  I gave a lot of lectures on this and try to be non-technical because it's basic what I call basic immunology [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=552.9200000000001s)]
*  And the problem with cancer is [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=560.84s)]
*  it's been treated by oncologists and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=564.88s)]
*  not [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=567.76s)]
*  immunologists and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=568.76s)]
*  Immunologists don't see patients because they look at basic immunology and then when you have infection and you have virology [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=570.32s)]
*  So this cross disciplines of virology immunology oncology all these allergies don't talk to each other. Yes [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=576.88s)]
*  So you're saying just big picture for non specialists of which I'm of course one [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=585.28s)]
*  You're saying that cancer is to some extent a problem with your immune system. It is everything about you immune system [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=590.44s)]
*  So you've got all kinds of defective cells that could become cancer or cancer in your body at all times at all times [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=596.76s)]
*  But your body is zapping them correct, right which is and that's the fundamental balance of the human body, correct [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=602.0s)]
*  and when that body gets out of balance when the killer cells become [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=607.8199999999999s)]
*  suppressed or [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=612.92s)]
*  That's effective. That's when you get cancer, correct [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=614.4s)]
*  Okay, so I'm sorry to interrupt. I just know it's I love it because [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=617.4s)]
*  That's the perfect [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=622.6s)]
*  Interpretation that I couldn't do [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  In a non-technical way because I think that's a guy I get too nerdy [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=627.6s)]
*  So I'm glad what you are a doctor [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=633.44s)]
*  So but that's that that's I think is what's happening in our body we have these perturbations [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  But we in equilibrium, you know, and that's a good thing the moment you knock yourself out of equilibrium [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=645.5600000000001s)]
*  Now what could knock you out of equilibrium and that's why when you know [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=652.2399999999999s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy is talking about the standing up about the toxins in our food [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=656.16s)]
*  the toxins in PFAS the processed food [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=661.12s)]
*  and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=666.04s)]
*  viral infections and [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=668.16s)]
*  Really what knocks out of balance basically is inflammation [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=670.56s)]
*  If you have inflammation in your body [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=675.3199999999999s)]
*  This is now I'm gonna get nerdy again these cells called neutrophils that actually see an infection and tries to kill it [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=678.6s)]
*  Which it does but if there's persistent information these neutrophils actually flip into a suppressor cell [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=687.4s)]
*  So what people don't realize is that we have the yin yang in our body that every cell has a counter cell [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=694.96s)]
*  And that's what I was about to go there I said the most fun conversation I had where I was asked by [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=703.56s)]
*  Astrophysicist or physicists to give a lecture is I named this [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=712.16s)]
*  concept of cancer a quantum theory [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=717.28s)]
*  like a physicist [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=720.88s)]
*  And that in our body we have cells that can be in two states [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=723.12s)]
*  It can be a killer or or or suppressor and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=729.52s)]
*  Like the Schrodinger's cat it could be alive or dead and it depends what you do with it [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=733.6s)]
*  And so I named the sin quantum onco therapeutics just to be controversial [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=739.1999999999999s)]
*  So the doctors could understand what I'm talking about is that we need to understand [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=744.36s)]
*  The fact that you have a killer t-cell and you have a killer suppressor cell [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=751.48s)]
*  We have an M1 macrophage that actually chomps things up in M2 macrophages that blocks that you have an NK cell it kills [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=757.72s)]
*  And NK cells that inhibits and we need to have that balance. Otherwise, you'll get into autoimmune disease [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=765.88s)]
*  But there's a thing called quantum entanglement that is the scatter live was this cat dead if somebody interacts [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=773.36s)]
*  with that [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=781.52s)]
*  And the person that interacts with that is the doctor [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=783.16s)]
*  So you as a doctor could either [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  Be enlightened enough to activate just the activators and suppressor suppressors and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=790.92s)]
*  Change the dynamic towards the cure [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=797.72s)]
*  But it's very complex because it's now quantum [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=801.12s)]
*  Because all those changes are happening in minutes in your body these molecules [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=804.4399999999999s)]
*  Like God's particle where they're colliding with each other and cells are colliding and interacting happens within minutes [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  So you need to have a theory of how do you interact at that level? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=818.84s)]
*  And in so doing the first thing you need to understand is how does cancer happen and then how does it grow? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=825.64s)]
*  How do you stop it [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=833.92s)]
*  This idea of a vaccine a cancer vaccine [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=836.92s)]
*  Do you radiate that cancer do you remove that cancer do you remove the lymph nodes do you give chemotherapy? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=840.8s)]
*  And crazy enough over the last 50 years. I figured out that everything we're doing [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=848.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not the word wrong because that's a bad statement a pejorative statement [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=855.56s)]
*  It's not enlightened a better way to say it because everything we're doing is tipping the scales towards the suppressor cells [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=861.12s)]
*  We're activating the suppressor cells [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=868.04s)]
*  We're not activating the killing cells and we can go into this conversation where I can explain that [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=870.56s)]
*  So the key system which you just said is cancer is all about the immune system [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=876.28s)]
*  So if you activate the immunosuppressor system [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  You get more cancer. So then the fundamental root cause is what's activating that immune system on the other way? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=885.9599999999999s)]
*  Yes, and that's something is suppressing [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=892.8s)]
*  People's immune systems including the poor 13 year old boy who died of pancreatic cancer and the question is what is that? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=896.4s)]
*  And maybe there are a lot of causes but it is, you know [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=902.18s)]
*  We're not the first people to notice there's been an increase in scary cancers in populations that didn't used to get them [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=904.9399999999999s)]
*  it's very obvious just from living here and [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=910.84s)]
*  a lot of people have pointed to both kovat the virus and to the mRNA COVID vaccines as [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=913.88s)]
*  Potential causes do you think that they're related? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=920.3s)]
*  The best way for me to answer that is to look at history [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=923.84s)]
*  What we know about virally induced cancers is well established we know that if you get hepatitis you get liver cancer [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=928.8s)]
*  Hepatitis is a virus infection. You know if you get human papilloma virus HPV you get cervical cancer. Yes [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=937.52s)]
*  Certain kinds of throat cancer are caused by viruses as well, right? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=947.12s)]
*  If you get HIV you get Kaposi sarcoma, yes [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=951.0s)]
*  so [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=954.88s)]
*  We call that oncogenic viruses in medical terms meaning viruses that are induced carcinogenic and the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=956.08s)]
*  Fundamental basis for that are threefold [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=963.36s)]
*  the hallmarks of an oncogenic virus is one it must persist and [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=966.2s)]
*  Why because it continues create inflammation and why with inflammation you get suppression? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=970.36s)]
*  Because your body's trying to suppress it [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=976.64s)]
*  It must inhibit the single p53 that's in your body to try and protect your body from not having cancer [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=979.64s)]
*  And if it persists and causes inflammation and and here inhibits p53 [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=987.3199999999999s)]
*  It begins to have the hallmarks of an oncogenic virus [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=993.6s)]
*  So then the question is does kovat whether it come from the vaccine, which is the spike protein vaccine or? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=998.76s)]
*  From the infection which is spike driven that gets into every cell of our body [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  Because it goes through the cell of the body [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1011.6s)]
*  It goes wherever you have the thing called the ace to receptor which is in the blood vessels [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1013.8000000000001s)]
*  So wherever you have a blood vessel in your body [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1018.32s)]
*  It's where it's gonna go and if it has an ace to receptor on that blood vessel [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1021.36s)]
*  That's where it can go because that's the purpose of the spike protein to penetrate to hijack that ace to receptor and get into their cells [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1025.1200000000001s)]
*  So that's why it gets into pancreas [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1031.72s)]
*  That's why you have brain fog because it disrupts the blood vessels of the brain and cause mitochondrial dysfunction [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1033.24s)]
*  That's why in the colon which is a high energy. I track is a high ace to receptor [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1039.0s)]
*  That's why I pancreas eyes is to receptor where that's why you people have in the in the heart you have dysfunction [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1044.16s)]
*  You've seen young people have sudden heart attacks all of a sudden [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1051.64s)]
*  You see young people with pancreatic cancer all of a sudden you see young people's colon cancer [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1056.68s)]
*  young people's colon cancer all of a sudden [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1061.12s)]
*  So is it by [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1063.8799999999999s)]
*  Coincidence that post covid [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1066.9199999999998s)]
*  Infection post covid vaccine we seeing all these events where we know the spike protein goes there. I [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1070.1999999999998s)]
*  Don't think so. I think it's not a coincidence. So the question is [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1077.0s)]
*  Can we prove? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1081.6799999999998s)]
*  Is this what I call long covid flyer is persisting and [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1084.0s)]
*  The group at University of California San Francisco has now definitively proven that and published that in papers like nature [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1088.6799999999998s)]
*  Can we also prove that once you have that persistence of that virus does that covert virus? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1097.0s)]
*  Suppress the natural killer cell does a natural killer cell actually [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1102.1599999999999s)]
*  Not only go to sleep becomes what you call a nerd you that's now been published [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1106.6799999999998s)]
*  The natural killer cells gone to sleep [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1112.96s)]
*  So by your definition we just solve the mystery right there I [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1115.44s)]
*  Think so, I think this is a conversation I had with the wait. I mean [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1123.72s)]
*  Billions of people literally billions of people had the covert virus over a billion got the spike protein [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1129.28s)]
*  vaccine [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1136.56s)]
*  So that's like we're talking like a huge percentage of the Earth's population [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1138.08s)]
*  Unless I'm missing something now, you understand what keeps you awake at night and [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1142.16s)]
*  Skept me awake at night for two years [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1149.2s)]
*  Two and a half years and that's why I sort of abandoned everything just to focus on how do we clear the virus? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1151.68s)]
*  Because the answer is to clear the virus from the body from the body. The answer is to stop the inflammation [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1158.8000000000002s)]
*  Because it's chronic inflammation [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1165.52s)]
*  Privacy should be a right for all citizens in this country. It's a prerequisite to freedom. No privacy. No freedom [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1167.8799999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately in America privacy is a luxury [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1173.2s)]
*  So who gets the luxury of privacy you don't we don't privacy is given to government agencies [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1176.2s)]
*  They've got millions of classified documents actually over a billion in this country [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1182.2s)]
*  The average American citizen meanwhile is being watched every time here [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1185.96s)]
*  She goes online data brokers are tracking and recording everything you do [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1189.94s)]
*  They're selling what they learn about you and your private life to advertisers even to the government to the NSA [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1194.12s)]
*  What do you do about it? Well, we use a product called Express VPN [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1200.28s)]
*  Express VPN is an app that sends a hundred percent of your online traffic through secure encrypted servers [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1204.8s)]

*  Because I ask a dumb question. How long does the virus remain in the human body? So far we found three years four years [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1257.06s)]
*  Is there any reason to believe it'll naturally go away? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1264.82s)]
*  Not if your body's image suppressed [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1268.34s)]
*  So it's a circle [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1271.78s)]
*  You ask what causes cancer [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1274.86s)]
*  Because your body's image suppressed you have in your body nature's compound [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1277.54s)]
*  And if the tumor or the infection or the inflammation? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1283.54s)]
*  Suppresses it [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1288.26s)]
*  You have to find a way to reactivate it and clear the virus. It's just really as simple as that [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1289.82s)]
*  And that's the missing link that I think so it sounds like you're describing what could be like the worst human health crisis in history [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1296.98s)]
*  I don't know how to say that [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1307.46s)]
*  Without saying it it scares the pants off me because I think [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1310.58s)]
*  What we may be it's I don't think it's viruses man. Now, you know, this is existential [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1315.4199999999998s)]

*  Because [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1333.98s)]
*  While there was an increase rise in cancer in our country because of the idea of [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1335.26s)]
*  The toxins and anything else this immunosuppression that has occurred now globally and [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1340.94s)]
*  More importantly the immunosuppression tied to inflammation chronic inflammation [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1347.5s)]
*  Which is asymptomatic and sometimes and sometimes it's not this 15 million Americans with long go [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1352.78s)]

*  13 year old pancreatic cancer [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1373.1799999999998s)]

*  The [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1378.22s)]

*  I certainly hope so because you spent your life around scary diseases like that's been your life [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1384.8999999999999s)]

*  If you're scared then that's that's not a good sign [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1391.58s)]
*  I'm scared but hopeful. I think it's important for me to have this conversation with you not just that's why [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1397.1399999999999s)]
*  Okay, I'll share with your conversation. I had I got invited by the CEO of the Henry Jackson Foundation to come to [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1404.1s)]
*  DC I think October November last year during the election phase [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1411.46s)]
*  and just to have a conversation about but what I'm doing and [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1416.62s)]
*  There he brought the leader from Walter Reed the the barter the DOD [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1420.02s)]
*  The NIH the NID all into that room and was just me [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1429.66s)]
*  And I said it is time it is time for me to reveal to this learned group of leaders [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1435.14s)]
*  But what I'm scared about and I spent I think it was three hours [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1442.5s)]
*  No slides just me speaking alone on the stage and all of them in the audience [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1447.3000000000002s)]
*  When I first started the conversation the first sentence was I think kovat is oncogenic [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1453.3000000000002s)]
*  One of the members of the audience said that's nonsense. I said, okay [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1460.0400000000002s)]
*  Let me explain to you what we've been doing in our research at the end of three hours for hours [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1463.98s)]
*  You said you've got to publish this this is so important [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1469.6200000000001s)]
*  And I said yes [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1473.6200000000001s)]
*  We are processing the publication and what came out was this paper that they biopsied the colon of young people [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1475.3000000000002s)]
*  Temporally when no kovat to kovat and showed the persistence of [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1483.18s)]
*  replicating viruses in the colon tissue two years out [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1488.5s)]
*  replicating kovat viruses replicating code viruses [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1493.3000000000002s)]
*  Replicating [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1498.42s)]
*  a [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1501.02s)]
*  Symptomatic replicating in the tissue meaning there's inflammation and [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1502.6200000000001s)]
*  When you have this inflammation these neutrophils now getting geeky again [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1508.54s)]
*  Plasticize flip [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1514.42s)]
*  From a protective neutrophil to a suppressive neutrophil. It's called an n2 [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1516.22s)]
*  It's called a myelo derived suppressor cell. That's an official name [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1521.26s)]
*  So now you have suppression in your body [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1527.14s)]
*  And it's no wonder that then converts into colon cancer [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1531.22s)]
*  But is this true? Do you think for I mean have you had kovat? No [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1535.22s)]
*  Lucky man, not lucky man T cell man. I [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1541.3000000000002s)]
*  Have a T cell in my body that protects me from the nuclear capsid [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1546.26s)]
*  Where do I get one? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1552.94s)]
*  That trial was held up by the FDA and by Collins and Fauci you never got kovat because your protector cells were so strong [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1555.5s)]
*  Not only a protector cells if I do get kovat the virus clears [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1566.02s)]
*  You want to clear the virus I get the hell out of my body get it out [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1570.54s)]
*  Wait, I just want to pause here. I know you're in the midst of a much larger story [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1576.3s)]
*  But this is something I think everyone can understand. So I [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1579.8600000000001s)]
*  Think I'm in good health. I am in very robust. Did you have kovat? I did how many times one? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1583.02s)]
*  I never took the virus. I never took the vaccine. Okay [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1588.26s)]
*  But I got kovat knocked me right on my butt. It was a bad three days fine [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1592.9599999999998s)]
*  But I don't understand you're older than I am. How did you never get let's just I just want to get very specific [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1600.22s)]
*  Like how do I mean everyone on the planet got kovat? Okay, so let me let me give you some idea. Okay [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1607.46s)]
*  One because we understand the implications [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1616.86s)]
*  My wife touch wood also never get covered because both of us. So this is this is this story [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1620.8999999999999s)]
*  We by by that unfortunately I relate this it's a [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1629.4199999999998s)]
*  Painful thing to me because I related to Kobe's death. It was during Kobe's time. We passed away and [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1634.22s)]
*  at the funeral [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1639.82s)]
*  Kobe Bryant who you were close to correct very close to [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1641.3s)]
*  And at the funeral at his funeral all the people in the room [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1644.98s)]
*  And there's I think November [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1650.54s)]
*  And I turned to Gavin Newsom. I said listen [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1653.6599999999999s)]
*  This is one virus. I'm worried about because I was studying this virus, you know [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1656.74s)]
*  I understand HPV very well and I understand hepatitis. I said this is not a respiratory virus. This is a dangerous virus [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1661.22s)]
*  So I went back and I shut down our [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1669.8200000000002s)]
*  Organization so that we could actually do nothing else but kovat my entire team of hundreds of scientists [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1673.46s)]
*  On zoom and everything else around the world [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1680.7800000000002s)]
*  I said we must go after this virus with a vaccine that clears the virus [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1683.3400000000001s)]
*  And the only way to clear the virus is to have what we call the T cell and NK cell the cells that kills [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1691.26s)]
*  Cancer cells and I wrote a paper with Carlos Codona says kovats like cancer and cancers like Kovat [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1697.74s)]
*  Meaning it's immense suppression that causes its spread and it's immense suppression by the kovat virus that allows it to persist [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1703.8600000000001s)]
*  So the only vaccine that's important is a T cell vaccine, but that's why I'm telling you [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1713.38s)]
*  Virologists think about antibodies versus cellular therapy. It's foreign to them to have a vaccine that stimulates T cells [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1720.22s)]
*  So I said I understand that [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1731.5s)]
*  Internally, it's a weird since in 20 minutes you explained it to me not particularly high IQ not a scientist [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1733.9s)]
*  I understand exactly what you're saying. Why don't for out? Why isn't it obvious to virologists? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1739.66s)]
*  Why isn't that like day one? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1745.94s)]
*  Lesson in virology school that the T cells at the the cells that [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1748.3s)]
*  Protect you against all potential internal harm [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1753.78s)]
*  They're the key because every vaccine so far is antibody based [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1756.94s)]
*  Dogma dogma blind spots [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1762.46s)]
*  Dogma blind spots nicely put okay. I'm sorry. I keep stepping in a story. So no you figure out [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1771.14s)]
*  You're not stepping because you're allowing you actually interpreting its pleasure to me because I don't know what I'm saying [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1777.26s)]
*  Sometimes whether it's gonna be so geeky it gets lost. It's important for the audience for you to interpret [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1783.02s)]
*  This is what Sanjay did for me in the 60 minutes. He was brilliant. They said he spent two years with me, by the way [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1788.56s)]
*  Doing a little 15 minute piece [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1794.1s)]
*  Wow, yeah, we'd come to LA we do this through shoot shoot shoot and we just had breakfast [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1796.58s)]
*  Okay, so you figure out early everyone's panicked about kovat [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1802.5s)]
*  Okay, but your position is they're panicked for the wrong reasons [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1808.1799999999998s)]
*  and actually maybe they're not quite as panicked as they should be because [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1811.8999999999999s)]
*  This virus could pave the way for cancer because it will suppress the immune system of the human body [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1815.22s)]
*  So you in November you said when did you write so so? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1820.72s)]
*  by March 2020 we had the vaccine [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1825.6599999999999s)]
*  March 2020 because I had built a full GMP facility [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1829.5400000000002s)]
*  For cancer using the same vaccine that NCI had retested for HPV and for colon cancer with think will see you so I'd create this [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1834.7s)]
*  Vaccine in which we would educate your body prior to kovat [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1844.0600000000002s)]
*  For the treatment of cancer to educate the T cells to recognize a cancer cell to kill it [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1850.3600000000001s)]
*  That's called a cancer vaccine [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1855.94s)]
*  But which by the way is for the only vaccine in clinical trials today to prevent cancer [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1857.7s)]
*  That the NCI is running using our technology is there no you can take the word vaccine out and call it something else [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1862.74s)]
*  I'm calling it bio shield [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1867.38s)]
*  Just scared the crap out I know [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1870.5800000000002s)]
*  Because it's not a vaccine in that general sense of an antibody based vaccine. It's your body's bio shield [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1872.7s)]
*  So I'm we'll announce it on the show [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1879.7s)]
*  We're gonna call this project bio shield which by the way in 2004 there was a bio shield act for national preparedness [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1882.0s)]
*  For against radiation [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1890.4s)]
*  against a [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1892.8400000000001s)]
*  pandemic infectious diseases [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1894.44s)]
*  so [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1896.8000000000002s)]
*  We have the worst thing that could happen to you [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1898.04s)]
*  Is to have us one dose of radiation or wipe out your NK cells and your T cells. That's how you die [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1902.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's how you get cancer it's after immune system except your immune system [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1909.4s)]
*  so we wanted to create a bio shield and [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1914.04s)]
*  the bio shield is to educate your body to have these T cells called memory T cells and go and hide in the bone marrow and [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1917.4s)]
*  come out when they need it and [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1924.68s)]
*  Kill that cell so it can never do damage [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1927.3600000000001s)]
*  That's the concept and it's not a foreign concept. We published it with the National Cancer Institute [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1930.8s)]
*  So by March 2020 I took all my resources. Thank God we had the resources [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1937.68s)]
*  So that's the sort of if was this your money all my money [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1942.16s)]
*  Okay, so I should just say I alluded to it earlier [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1946.3600000000001s)]
*  But you had a couple of companies making cancer drugs you owned all of them [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1949.16s)]
*  I mean you want I think a hundred percent of the companies you sold them for ten billion dollars or something [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1953.1200000000001s)]
*  So but rather than buy a vineyard you continued in your work. Is that a fair? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1957.68s)]
*  You know as I said to you over breakfast I had no idea about stocks [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1962.24s)]
*  So when the two companies were bought and they were bought for the right reasons [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1967.52s)]
*  the one company was [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1971.16s)]
*  American pharmaceutical partners and we were making literally close to a million vials a day in the United States [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1972.3600000000001s)]
*  manufacturing of [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1979.16s)]
*  150 different SKUs for every part of the hospital and was safe for heparin so Fresenius said we want to buy you we said great [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1981.16s)]
*  And then I developed this molecule [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1987.52s)]
*  That was feeding the tumor that could actually activate the immune system to activate the macrophages called a Braxane [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1990.04s)]
*  And selgene said we want to buy you I said great and the purpose for my selling them [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=1996.16s)]
*  Was not for the money clearly it was for the money [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2001.44s)]
*  But the purpose of the use of the money to pursue this dream of this astrophysics [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2004.24s)]
*  To find God's particle in your human body to activate your immune system [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2009.44s)]
*  That was the purpose of this money and that's all I've done with the money [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2013.72s)]
*  I spent about three billion dollars of this money. I've not gotten one penny [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2017.2800000000002s)]
*  from the government [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2022.92s)]
*  Not even one dime [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2024.76s)]
*  You're the only one yeah [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2026.76s)]
*  And maybe that's the freedom and the liberation allow me to say what I can say now. That's right. So [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2028.76s)]
*  Again, I keep pulling this away because there's a lot here. That's interesting [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2035.72s)]
*  Again I keep pulling this away because there's a lot here that's interesting but how did you not get kovat? Okay? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2040.04s)]
*  So I recognized that [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2049.52s)]
*  So Peter mox and I had these conversations so he was the head of Ciba and [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2052.4s)]
*  I was in pinging him with the science because this is a biologic [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2058.92s)]
*  And I was saying to Peter [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2065.12s)]
*  Listen Peter I need to show you that we need to create a t-cell vaccine and he said well [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2067.48s)]
*  We don't do t-cell vaccines everybody's doing the other vaccines, but great. Let's continue anybody vaccines antibody vaccines [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2072.88s)]
*  Then he called me and he said [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2081.08s)]
*  We're gonna create warp speed and now he's a star trekking and I'm a star trekking. I love warp speed [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2083.44s)]
*  I said, okay, we got to do this in warp speed. Absolutely [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2088.64s)]
*  But the only way Peter you're gonna do this in warp speed [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2091.7999999999997s)]
*  You need we need as a country [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2095.2s)]
*  To have NIH and barter fund a trial [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2099.04s)]
*  Where we take macaque monkeys? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2103.36s)]
*  We give them the vaccine and everybody should throw their vaccine in because I don't care where it's not mine or theirs [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2106.4s)]
*  Whoever's vaccine to clear the virus the only way to this experiment you give the monkeys the vaccine [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2112.16s)]
*  It's under your control [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2119.48s)]
*  You have a hundred monkeys everybody gets a set of vaccines and then you infect the [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2121.44s)]
*  monkeys in a BSL 3 facility with a high dose of kovat and [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2129.48s)]
*  Then you see in their lungs and the tissue that there's no virus after seven days [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2133.76s)]
*  Absolutely, that was warp speed so I was one of eight of warp speed [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2141.36s)]
*  Then I get a call Patrick you do warped [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2147.8s)]
*  You are there I should test my vaccine anyway [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2153.52s)]
*  They didn't know vaccine tested the NIH and barter it cleared the virus as I predicted [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2158.1600000000003s)]
*  There was no virus in the lungs and bar after a big infection [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2164.2000000000003s)]
*  So I said, okay [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2167.96s)]
*  I'm D warped and [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2170.2400000000002s)]
*  this was a [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2173.04s)]
*  Francis Collins scheme and [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2174.92s)]
*  Anthony Fauci scheme and monty slawy scheme [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2177.56s)]
*  And we one day wouldn't talk about the conversation ever once you slawy and what I've learned about Francis Collins. I mean that [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2181.52s)]
*  in that event and [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2189.32s)]
*  They were gonna go after this antibody vaccine, which is this mRNA vaccine with spike [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2191.48s)]
*  And I said, this is too important. I told my people we're gonna build our own vaccine with our own money. I [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2196.8s)]
*  Couldn't get enough material other than to do one batch and we're gonna do a phase one trial [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2202.44s)]
*  And we're gonna inject as many people that we can do in the phase one trial. I'm one of them. I [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2208.96s)]
*  injected myself [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2215.72s)]
*  And your wife and then and we're gonna measure I [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2218.2799999999997s)]
*  Talk about I don't talk about the family [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2222.2s)]
*  We're gonna measure my own blood. I [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2225.08s)]
*  drew my own blood and [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2228.2s)]
*  Tested and I have T cells to two nucleocapsid and to spike [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2230.8399999999997s)]
*  Which means if I were to get covered touch word [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2238.2s)]
*  The T cells now our memory T cells would clear the virus [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2242.3599999999997s)]
*  So we then [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2247.04s)]
*  Tried begged begged [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2249.64s)]
*  Because not for funding even [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2252.96s)]
*  But for the plastic bags that were now [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2255.68s)]
*  Restricted as you grow these things to Pfizer and Moderna all the materials that you need in the biological facility [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2259.56s)]
*  Got zero [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2268.2799999999997s)]
*  I've only got one batch. So so I'm going to South Africa and [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2270.44s)]
*  Inject these in patients with HIV because that's the biggest test you could have [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2274.72s)]
*  You can generate T cells in the patients with HIV and do this phase two and phase three trial in South Africa [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2279.04s)]
*  So we did that and then I called Peter and I said Peter I'm sorry what were the results like T cells [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2287.16s)]
*  The people that interestingly enough [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2297.56s)]
*  It doesn't say just so you know, you have to differentiate [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2302.7999999999997s)]
*  Does it actually prevent the penetration of the virus versus [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2308.12s)]
*  The load of the virus versus the clearance of the viruses are three different things [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2312.24s)]
*  so [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2317.76s)]
*  We think it prevents the penetration [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2320.24s)]
*  But we don't know because as soon as it does penetrate it would clear so you wouldn't even know [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2322.72s)]
*  or the T cell vaccine [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2328.16s)]
*  This is anecdotal but some of the people who got our T cell vaccine [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2330.8s)]
*  The family members got covered they didn't get it obviously the vaccine and they didn't get covered from the time while living with the family [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2334.84s)]
*  The issue of clearing the virus in transmission was the key [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2345.56s)]
*  So an antibody vaccine [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2350.44s)]
*  May reduce the viral load and therefore reduce death, which is a good thing that president trump did [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2353.96s)]
*  But the next generation of clearing the virus was what was needed and both should have been developed simultaneously [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2359.96s)]
*  It wasn't [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2368.52s)]
*  I'll share with you [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2370.52s)]
*  To this day. It's a mystery to me why [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2372.2s)]
*  but [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2375.96s)]
*  The the opportunity to clear the virus was actually known [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2377.48s)]
*  I think by by Collins and by Fauci that it did [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2382.6s)]
*  Not clear the virus the spike [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2385.72s)]
*  Vaccines of spike vaccine the Pfizer-medarin antibody vaccine does not end to this day does not clear the virus [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2388.52s)]
*  That seems like a big deal well, I just what we talked about if you don't clear the virus [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2396.7599999999998s)]
*  And you have a pieces of the virus in there especially spike [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2403.9599999999996s)]
*  Whether from the infection or from the vaccine [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2408.2s)]
*  And now you have a virus that's not clear [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2411.3199999999997s)]
*  Vaccine and now you get another infection [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2414.04s)]
*  Now the virus brings along this nucleic capsid [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2418.7599999999998s)]
*  Now it reconjoins [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2422.84s)]
*  And replicates again [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2424.84s)]
*  In these what they call privileged sites two years later [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2427.56s)]
*  So what we've seen now we're back to persistence [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2432.92s)]
*  That's now published just months ago [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2436.52s)]
*  And this is what I shared with nh secretly four months ago [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2440.2s)]
*  And persistence asymptomatic persistence, but with inflammation [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2444.04s)]
*  And reduction of p53 and immunosuppression [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2452.44s)]
*  Are all the hallmarks and recipes for cancer [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2458.7599999999998s)]
*  And coming back to your first question is why are we seeing an increase in young people? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2463.8s)]
*  I think all of the above the toxins the history [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2469.56s)]
*  The red dye the p-fas the covet [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2474.52s)]
*  All of the above does both covet and the covet vaccine lower over time [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2479.16s)]
*  The human immune system the vaccine itself [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2487.56s)]
*  Um up regulates temporarily the antibodies [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2492.52s)]
*  But if the vaccine the this the spike protein breaks off [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2497.48s)]
*  And the d the rna or dna goes into the cells [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2502.3599999999997s)]
*  And with it from infection or the vaccine that's where the controversy is right it could be both [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2509.16s)]
*  And the vaccine doesn't clear the virus that's the key [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2516.68s)]
*  It doesn't clear the virus and that's why [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2521.8799999999997s)]
*  We were told of course you take the virus and then you can't get covet or transmit it [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2525.7999999999997s)]
*  But neither one turned out to be true [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2531.3199999999997s)]
*  Demonstrably untrue. I mean well, it's not only demonstrably untrue. It was knowingly untrue [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2534.02s)]
*  That's what's bad about [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2539.48s)]
*  Would seem like that's criminal actually [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2542.68s)]
*  I mean if I tell you that [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2545.48s)]
*  You know this car gets 40 miles the gallon and instead it blows up [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2547.88s)]
*  That's a crime. You can't [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2552.84s)]
*  Sell anything under false pretenses. That's a crime. I don't see how this is not a crime, but [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2554.84s)]
*  Well, as I as you said of a breakfast it's it's not a conspiracy if it's true [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2559.96s)]
*  I believe you're writing a book with that title [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2567.08s)]
*  You probably have no idea where your meat comes from [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2569.16s)]
*  You probably should know the likelihood is that the meat you're eating passed through a massive industrial processing plant [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2571.64s)]
*  Probably owned by a foreign corporation [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2577.78s)]
*  Foreign meat. Did you sign up for that? We don't think you did [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2580.76s)]
*  So you probably have no idea of knowing where the animal grew up with that animal ate or what chemicals big food [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2584.6s)]
*  Pumped into the animal to increase profits. That's all kept secret meaning you can never really know what you're putting in your mouth [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2591.56s)]
*  and in your body [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2598.68s)]
*  That's disgusting if you think about it and it's easy to fix [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2600.2799999999997s)]
*  Merriwether farms a farm owned by friends of ours is a great option. We use their meat. We eat their meat [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2603.72s)]
*  for every meal [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2610.2799999999997s)]
*  Unlike corporate farmers merriwether farms controls the entire thing from the pasture the cattle graze on to the facility where the beef is packaged [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2611.64s)]
*  In wyoming and across the mountain west the cattle are raised without hormones without antibiotics or any other additive [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2620.12s)]
*  Clean american beef you can trust every single time and they will ship it straight to your door [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2626.44s)]
*  Go to merriwether farms.com [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2631.88s)]

*  We eat it and vouch for it. So [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2644.36s)]
*  And you know that they knew you've established for a fact that the developers of this and our public health authorities knew [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2647.8s)]
*  That the covet vax would neither prevent [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2654.6s)]
*  infection nor transmission [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2659.0s)]
*  Yes [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2661.6400000000003s)]
*  And worse, I think [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2663.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, it's not well known [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2665.1600000000003s)]
*  That during the first [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2667.88s)]
*  President trump election he offered me a position [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2673.32s)]
*  And I turned it down because I said to him I really could help him from outside in better than and I had too much to do [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2679.6400000000003s)]
*  I really sure was working on this. Thank god working on this [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2686.2000000000003s)]
*  Potential cure for cancer as well as clearing the virus with covet this this what I call the missing link which we can talk about [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2690.44s)]
*  This activator of the unnatural killer cells this bioshield [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2697.56s)]
*  And we have this bioshield now [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2702.2s)]
*  So it was the right decision for me not to go into the government during that time and to stay stay out [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2704.6s)]
*  This was 16 17 correct [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2711.24s)]
*  But worse i've since discovered [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2715.08s)]
*  Not by my inquiry, but it's been revealed to me emails [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2718.68s)]
*  about francis collins [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2722.84s)]
*  And some politicians work hard to prevent me from even joining becoming head of nh [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2724.92s)]
*  And I think that was the motivation all the way downstream that we asked okay, so what happened to this vaccine [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2732.6800000000003s)]
*  So I called the fda [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2739.8s)]
*  And said, okay, I can't do a randomized placebo control trial now because you got [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2742.6000000000004s)]
*  Pfizer's moderna vaccines all over the place [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2748.9s)]
*  So let me be the booster [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2752.2000000000003s)]
*  And peter marx to his credit was the one who said absolutely [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2755.0s)]
*  Peter marx to his credit was the one who says i'm worried about this covet vaccine and this long covet [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2760.76s)]
*  I want to study the effects of this vaccine [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2767.32s)]
*  Peter walks with then said to me patrick fine go ahead [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2770.28s)]
*  I injected the first three patients as a booster. I get the call from the fda to say [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2773.6400000000003s)]
*  You have to stop [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2780.6800000000003s)]
*  I said why? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2782.28s)]
*  To this day, they never explained to me. It wasn't peter. It was people around peter [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2785.6400000000003s)]
*  Said you must stop [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2792.1200000000003s)]
*  So we stopped [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2794.84s)]
*  And there was nothing more we could do anyway because we didn't have any of the resources the money the [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2796.36s)]
*  Supplies to complete a phase three [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2801.08s)]
*  So the government has a monopoly on some of the materials that you need to do this kind of testing in a bio lab [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2803.2400000000002s)]
*  Is that is that correct? Correct? But now we into biden era [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2807.8s)]
*  So now we in the biden era [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2811.1600000000003s)]
*  That said I must stop this is 2020 now [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2813.3199999999997s)]
*  So now beyond yeah, it was yeah, it was during the biden era [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2817.56s)]
*  And I think there there was this [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2825.56s)]
*  Sadly, i'm i'm not a conspiracy theorist, but now i've come to realize it truly was a deep state [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2829.16s)]
*  inside there [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2835.0s)]
*  That had a motivation beyond [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2836.44s)]
*  It's sad to say it's the most devastating to say beyond public health [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2839.16s)]
*  And you know, I just tweeted recently of how so few people could hurt so many and that's why [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2846.36s)]
*  When I tweeted about [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2856.28s)]
*  Finally, we have the right person in hhs with bobby kennedy will take this on [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2858.28s)]
*  And [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2862.2s)]
*  And that we have doctors that will be like marty mccary who I don't know but I do know is a surgeon [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2863.3199999999997s)]
*  Who can understand and touch and feel what it means? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2871.56s)]
*  To be there on behalf of the patient [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2875.48s)]
*  Um and my support for that [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2879.0s)]
*  I think we have a chance now to completely turn this around in this next [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2883.88s)]
*  I think this last election was in part about that. I think the [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2887.7999999999997s)]
*  National realization that covet was there was something very dark there. It wasn't just a virus that [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2892.52s)]
*  happened upon us, uh, naturally that there was [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2897.56s)]
*  There was there was a lot of evil bound up in it [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2901.08s)]
*  But just to back up a second, you said you have learned from watching covet that a few people can hurt so many who are those people? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2904.04s)]
*  I [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2910.36s)]
*  Think the main culprit really sitting there was collins francis collins francis collins and he control [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2912.52s)]
*  I mean [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2921.1600000000003s)]
*  I had shared with president trump that francis collins should not be the nh director [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2925.32s)]
*  He offered me a job [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2930.36s)]
*  Peter teal nominated me [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2933.6400000000003s)]
*  Um, and i've since found emails of francis collins [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2935.96s)]
*  Sending an email to a politician that alarm bells alarm bells peter teal is nominated patrick soon shong. We have to find a way to stop it [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2942.6s)]
*  Why to this day power greed [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2951.48s)]
*  Um [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2957.94s)]
*  political [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2959.48s)]
*  need [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2960.8399999999997s)]
*  He did the same thing with craig vento [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2962.2s)]
*  I remember during clinton's time with the human genome project where craig vento invented the sequencing machine for [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2963.8799999999997s)]
*  Tens of millions of dollars and he's spending billions of dollars doing nothing but wanted the credit [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2970.52s)]
*  I I think what happens to you when you're getting into washington [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2976.7599999999998s)]
*  The ego greed and power [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2982.2799999999997s)]
*  Changes your mindset [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2986.52s)]
*  um [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2989.72s)]
*  So I can't give motivation to that all I can tell you is when I saw that email I was [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2991.7999999999997s)]
*  Devastated that somebody would actually go to that extent [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=2996.8999999999996s)]
*  And then send that same email to the ceo of bio, which is all big pharma [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3001.08s)]
*  and [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3006.52s)]
*  That ceo bio said let's go to google search to find some dirt on him [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3008.52s)]
*  Turn you on me [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3014.4399999999996s)]
*  To stop me [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3016.9199999999996s)]
*  from being nominated [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3018.52s)]
*  To be head of nih or whatever. Let's google him to stop him. Let's google to find some dirt [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3020.52s)]
*  Some bad stuff negative research, whatever they want to find. They probably couldn't find any dirt on me, but that was the interchange between them [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3027.24s)]
*  On email [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3037.4s)]
*  But the funny thing is you made a product and by the way [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3039.08s)]
*  A clarification of terms my understanding was a vaccine was administered to a healthy person to prevent him from getting the disease [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3042.6s)]
*  You're describing a product the one that you made that you can inject into an infected person and it cures the infection [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3049.74s)]
*  That sounds more like a conventional medicine than a vaccine. It's a therapeutic a therapeutic [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3056.7s)]
*  Correct. So, you know, I use the word vaccine because that's what they understood [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3061.1s)]
*  You know, it's [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3066.06s)]
*  It's dogma in terminology, right? But you're but you're giving this to people who have covid who have hiv [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3068.06s)]
*  Well, I want to give it to people who don't have covid so we can actually if they don't get covid but then [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3075.4199999999996s)]
*  I am now giving to patients with hiv i'm giving to people with hbv i'm giving to people [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3079.66s)]

*  an authentic [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3384.62s)]
*  Man with a sense of purpose conviction courage [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3387.02s)]
*  He says what he really believes sometimes it may be wrong. Sometimes it may be right, but he says what he believes [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3391.66s)]
*  And I really believed oh my god, yes somebody [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3399.58s)]
*  Who would have the courage to take on the world and ask the questions [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3403.1s)]
*  And I said i'm going to support you [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3408.3799999999997s)]

*  he was dismissed by uh, no, not just dismissed attacked vilified by [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3414.54s)]
*  A lot of people in the medical establishment. I would say [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3420.7799999999997s)]
*  everybody [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3423.96s)]
*  Why were you? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3425.8199999999997s)]
*  willing to listen to him [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3427.74s)]
*  Because what he's saying is exactly what I was saying [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3429.8199999999997s)]
*  And I [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3434.4599999999996s)]
*  I'm sort of attacked by the same people because of the dogma that's out there. So let me give you this exam. I said bobby [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3435.58s)]
*  And I shared with him the story about hope hicks [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3443.5s)]
*  I said that you you you probably just walked out to the office and I walked in [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3446.8599999999997s)]
*  um [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3451.2599999999998s)]
*  in 2016 in 2017 [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3452.22s)]
*  I said listen [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3455.4199999999996s)]
*  You people think of you saying? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3456.8599999999997s)]
*  You shouldn't have a polio vaccine [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3459.02s)]
*  You that you're an anti-vaccinator [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3461.6600000000003s)]
*  What you really are saying you're worried about the excipients inside the vaccine [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3465.58s)]
*  So about the what? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3469.98s)]
*  Okay, so that's a technical [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3471.7400000000002s)]
*  The materials that go in with the vaccine. Yes the mercury, etc with the mercury, etc [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3475.1800000000003s)]
*  So I understand there's a polio vaccine is one two, three four polio vaccines have now been manufactured [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3480.54s)]
*  And now that all of a sudden is a new polio vaccine that's manufactured in which we have cow's serum calf serum [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3487.58s)]
*  inside that vaccine [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3494.14s)]
*  And I know and you know everybody knows in the uk knows you can get prion disease [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3496.22s)]
*  From this calf serum because you can't measure that [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3501.98s)]
*  So [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3507.02s)]
*  That got approved in four days [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3508.38s)]
*  With just because of safety the way dogma is happening, but there's other polio vaccines [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3510.8599999999997s)]
*  So you can take the other polio vaccines, but don't take that one [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3516.22s)]
*  Just like I was telling you about maybe I was telling you what propo false story over breakfast [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3520.06s)]
*  And you should explain it that way that you want to just to be examined [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3527.02s)]
*  And you sorry exactly I said, okay [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3532.7s)]
*  Not only did I get him [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3537.3399999999997s)]
*  He is asking the right questions [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3539.2599999999998s)]
*  And people are scared to ask these questions because his perverse incentives [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3542.0600000000004s)]
*  And that was what bothered me but in science [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3547.1800000000003s)]
*  Shouldn't any question be allowed exactly? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3551.1000000000004s)]
*  So when I tweeted I said he knows more science than most doctors [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3555.42s)]
*  He's much of it's a good thing you're rich because you'd be out of a job [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3561.34s)]
*  tweeting stuff like that, but it is right [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3566.86s)]
*  And and that's what's a blessing I think you know, I live the american dream and that's why you said okay [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3570.46s)]
*  I made this money the money is for the purpose of me able to do this [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3574.38s)]
*  and I was very [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3579.1s)]
*  Concerned about being too loud about it because if this deep state would hold up [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3580.94s)]
*  The approval and they did by the way, they put us into complete response later. I got a thousand requests for information the most [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3585.9s)]
*  my submission was close to [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3593.02s)]
*  700 000 pages [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3596.28s)]
*  In order to get this thing through [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3598.14s)]
*  700 000 [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3601.64s)]
*  It's like the u.s tax code this drug has been in trials now for eight years [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3603.02s)]
*  2015 how long was the pfizer mrna covid vaccine in trials months? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3608.3599999999997s)]
*  Not even [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3614.22s)]
*  So that's why i'm trying to say, you know this [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3615.58s)]
*  When I knew which one i'm taking, you know when you would talk about the user fees [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3618.54s)]
*  The user fees [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3622.54s)]
*  So we thought that the user fees was going to accelerate the approval where the fda gets user fees from pharma [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3624.54s)]
*  It turns out [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3631.5s)]
*  That the big pharma user fees are so large it pays for the salary for all these reviewers [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3634.3s)]
*  So now the biotech companies the young biotech companies are throttled [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3640.94s)]
*  So the big pharma that does this is incremental little [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3647.02s)]
*  Dots that just follow the revenue [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3650.7799999999997s)]
*  this checkpoints [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3653.1s)]
*  Multi-billion dollar mercs what 20 billion 30 billion on the revenue bristol mice follows it astrazeneca follows it roche follows it [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3654.62s)]
*  There's no [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3662.54s)]
*  They were the same [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3663.98s)]
*  But it's all about incremental sameness [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3665.2599999999998s)]
*  And follow the dollar [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3668.7799999999997s)]
*  But the innovation is really at this young biotech companies [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3670.7799999999997s)]
*  That are throttled [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3674.22s)]
*  So this is what needs to be changed by the fda today they need a complete revamp where people with skill sets [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3676.7s)]
*  And the skill sets of the modern science [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3684.7799999999997s)]
*  Not the old drugs [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3688.4599999999996s)]
*  Has to be in place [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3690.8599999999997s)]
*  To understand what's at stake here time for another true life alp story [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3692.9399999999996s)]
*  I got a call for a friend of mine yesterday honestly true story [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3696.9399999999996s)]
*  Who said his girlfriend had just broken up with him over alp? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3700.3799999999997s)]
*  He wouldn't stop and I thought to myself that's kind of sad and he said no, it's not sad [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3703.9s)]
*  Imagine if i'd married her [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3708.38s)]
*  Now I know I was saved [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3711.5s)]
*  Then the next day this same friend is driving at twice the speed limit through a major american city pulled over by a cop [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3713.74s)]
*  In a speed trap cop takes his license registration goes back to the patrol car runs him comes back looks in the window and sees a [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3719.1s)]
*  Tin of alp on the dashboard pauses [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3724.86s)]
*  Stunned says to my friend you use alp [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3727.98s)]
*  Yeah, I do says my friend so do I says the cop we all do he looks at my friend thoughtfully and goes [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3730.62s)]
*  Drive safely sir and hands back his license and registration no ticket [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3735.82s)]
*  So in two days he's saved from a tragic marriage to a girl who doesn't like alp and a speeding ticket all true [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3740.2999999999997s)]
*  It's more than a nicotine [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3747.18s)]
*  In an age of 350 million people are guessing there are about 350 million alp stories email us yours [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3750.06s)]
*  We want to know and read it on the air email tell all at alp pouch.com tell all at alp pouch.com [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3756.46s)]
*  Give us your alp story [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3764.2999999999997s)]
*  We have to take the conflicts out too, I mean if a reviewer is paid by the company whose drugs he's reviewing [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3771.1s)]
*  That's like such an obvious conflict in no other world would that be acceptable? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3777.3399999999997s)]
*  Not only wouldn't be acceptable [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3781.98s)]
*  If then that reviewer has also the role to block an innovator [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3784.46s)]
*  It gets worse again. This just seems like crime to me. Yeah [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3789.58s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if this were going on in another country [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3794.06s)]
*  Outside the united states [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3797.98s)]
*  And i'm an american so I give the united states every benefit of every doubt [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3799.5s)]
*  It takes me forever to realize something's corrupt because it's america. It's not corrupt, but if this were happening, I don't just name the country china [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3802.7s)]
*  south africa [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3810.46s)]
*  You know, i'd be like well, that's the most corrupt thing i've ever heard. Well, that's exactly the fear I have now [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3811.9s)]
*  The chinese don't have this restriction [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3817.02s)]
*  And their innovation is now outstripping us [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3820.7000000000003s)]
*  Think about that [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3824.06s)]
*  I've always said [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3825.5s)]
*  america's lead in health care and [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3827.1600000000003s)]
*  biomedical innovation [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3830.84s)]
*  Is the best in the world and if we could use biomedical innovation as foreign policy [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3832.7000000000003s)]
*  For africa into asia into india to bring that to the rest of the world, that's how we lead [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3839.18s)]
*  I now read the papers [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3846.62s)]
*  And the chinese science [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3848.94s)]
*  Is now outstripping us [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3850.94s)]
*  Look what happened to astrazeneca just last week [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3852.94s)]
*  They just spent two billion dollars investing in china now [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3855.66s)]
*  That's a tragedy for us not for manufacturing [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3859.5s)]
*  for innovation [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3862.78s)]
*  Oh, so that's not good not good [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3864.38s)]
*  Because the idea was we offshore all the manufacturing but we the ideas generate here so after zeneca's english company [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3866.94s)]
*  so what's what i'm saying is [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3873.1s)]
*  The fundamental problem I think lies at the fda [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3877.1800000000003s)]
*  and even the nh [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3880.78s)]
*  So the change that bobby's bringing in with jay now being ahead of nh and marty being a fta and bobby himself [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3883.1s)]
*  Having the courage to stand up to talk both against the food industrial complex and the pharma complex [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3889.7400000000002s)]
*  Take on the mercs of the world and the vices of the world [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3897.02s)]
*  Um, I think we have maybe an opportunity what I call a period of enlightenment [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3901.6600000000003s)]
*  And really i'm all about enlightenment. Um [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3908.46s)]
*  And if you look at the sanji piece, we are there now. So I want to actually send out. Can you guys stop and ask a question though? So your [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3911.5s)]
*  Position is that cancer but not just cancer all kinds of illnesses are caused [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3918.7000000000003s)]
*  By weakened immune system and inflammation [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3925.26s)]
*  It's all about the immune system your body functions you live or you die [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3928.54s)]
*  By the immune system the senescent cells aging [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3933.66s)]
*  Is the immune system? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3937.42s)]
*  The cells in your body [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3940.54s)]
*  That allow you to go to 100 years old 120 years old [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3942.7s)]
*  Is based on the activity and the function of the immune system because the immune system was regulating your healthy cells [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3946.86s)]
*  Can we just go through I know this is not [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3955.1s)]
*  like patentable this is not your business, but it's i'm [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3957.66s)]
*  What are some of the obvious things a person can do to strengthen his immune system? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3961.18s)]
*  So you ask what activates the natural killer cell? So this is your it's like [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3967.26s)]
*  You know when you look at the leaf and you talk about apoptosis and the leaf actually sits and goes brown [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3974.06s)]
*  And and and it changes but then goes back up [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3978.78s)]
*  so [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3982.2200000000003s)]
*  all of [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3983.98s)]
*  Human nature all of nature [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3985.1s)]
*  Is filled with this biology of this balance [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3987.5s)]
*  so you have [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3990.3s)]
*  You're a product of nature. I mean literally you're a product of [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3991.6600000000003s)]
*  When you were tadpole and a fish as we came out [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=3996.14s)]
*  So this cell is evolved since the cambrian age think about that this cell this natural killer cell in your body [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4000.14s)]
*  I published my first article in natural killer cell in 1990 [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4009.42s)]
*  That's this cell was only discovered in 1970s [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4013.2599999999998s)]
*  think about that [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4016.9399999999996s)]
*  And we've ignored that cell. This is what I call the missing link [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4019.18s)]
*  I'm going to announce that [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4023.58s)]
*  At the american urology conference in las vegas in the end of this month [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4025.8999999999996s)]
*  We have discovered [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4032.14s)]
*  I've not discovered the missing link. We've discovered the awareness of this missing link and how to activate this missing link [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4033.74s)]
*  So the idea is to activate the natural killer cell. It has 30 000 receptors on this cell [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4040.06s)]
*  What does natural killer cell does? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4048.22s)]
*  It replenishes itself with sleep. So sleep is important [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4051.5s)]
*  It replenishes itself with light [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4055.98s)]
*  with sunlight [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4058.54s)]
*  And I believe there's a certain wavelength the red wavelength in the sunlight that it actually requires for it to be stimulated [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4060.38s)]
*  So this is why people get sicker in the winter exactly that's why seattle has the highest suicide rate [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4067.84s)]
*  Think about that right? So these things and if you look at the places like [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4076.64s)]
*  Norway and sweden where there's a very little sun [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4083.04s)]
*  Finland [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4087.84s)]
*  So [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4090.08s)]
*  Nature is all about light [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4092.64s)]
*  sunlight [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4095.04s)]
*  So that's why I I think this is I like obvious observation [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4096.5599999999995s)]
*  Nations and nature is all about sunlight. Of course planes don't grow without sunlight [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4101.04s)]
*  and at the end of the day [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4105.759999999999s)]
*  We we we either about neutrons photons and electrons. That's it. That's what we are [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4108.0s)]
*  We as a human being is nothing else but a battery and end gate [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4112.879999999999s)]
*  When you think about that, right? So we have a bunch of electrons and neutrons and charges that floating through us that actually interact [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4117.36s)]
*  And that's how I think of the human body that's why I said I think of it as a natural physicist [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4124.48s)]
*  It's crazy, but that's how my mind works [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4129.68s)]
*  So sleep [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4133.68s)]
*  Getting sunlight and and and having food that doesn't even suppress your biome [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4135.12s)]
*  the bacteria in your body [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4141.6s)]
*  sends out [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4144.08s)]
*  Materials that actually will image suppress or activate [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4145.74s)]
*  What are the immunosuppressive foods? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4149.76s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4154.08s)]
*  Most natural foods are fine. It's the toxins in the food exactly what I said the excipients [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4156.16s)]
*  So when we talk about red dye the processed foods all this unnatural [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4161.28s)]
*  processed stuff [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4165.66s)]
*  Ultimately cause inflammation now when it gets back to this plasticity of inflammation [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4168.4s)]
*  Inflammation causes immunosuppression because it causes all these cells to flip. Yes from the killer state [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4176.78s)]
*  To the suppressor state. That's why we said we have this dichotomy of is the cat alive is the cat [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4184.08s)]
*  Dead you see it. You see it too in the elderly, you know [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4190.5599999999995s)]
*  It's why an infection or a you know, diabetic foot infection can lead to a systemic infection and kill the person, correct? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4194.0s)]
*  Right [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4201.12s)]
*  That's why you know when this guy discovered that h pylori causes gastric ulcer. They said you're nuts. It's acid [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4201.92s)]
*  I remember that so well so well [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4208.8s)]
*  So now when you think about that so that's what i'm saying this dogma but that's a consensus now, right acid does not cause ulcers [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4211.2s)]
*  Well, it's the cause and effect so h pylori causes the the inflammation and then the acid doesn't measure in your stomach [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4217.84s)]
*  Of course, but it's not the core cause correct, correct, but it's all about dogma. That's why I call this a vaccine [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4224.48s)]
*  But it's a bioshield [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4230.32s)]
*  So so you have to fight dogma part of the problem is you're fighting [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4233.04s)]
*  So I will ask you [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4237.04s)]
*  I wanted to [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4239.2s)]
*  Ask us to do an experiment. I'm all for it [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4240.8s)]
*  Where we pick up the phone call any random oncologist not to shame them [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4244.96s)]
*  primary care physician pick up the phone [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4250.4800000000005s)]
*  And said you do a cbc, correct? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4253.360000000001s)]
*  Yes, can you define what a cbc is a complete blood counter just so you take a blood and you look for [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4256.08s)]
*  Yeah, the blood screen that everyone's blood screen. Yeah for whether you're anemic or not anemic people understand that right red blood cells [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4261.4400000000005s)]
*  Then you see these red blood cells [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4267.76s)]
*  And you give chemotherapy and radiation [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4270.08s)]
*  And you ask what do you look for [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4274.16s)]
*  Well, we look to see if you're anemic [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4276.400000000001s)]
*  So we can give you this drug that amgen makes called epigen [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4278.56s)]
*  We look to see whether your platelets have gone down so we can give you a platelet transfusion [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4282.56s)]
*  We look to see whether your neutrophils have gone down so that you don't get an infection called neutropenic fever [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4287.04s)]
*  So we give you this drug in your picture [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4292.0s)]
*  So we give you a blood transfusion [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4294.0s)]
*  Well, the problem is does red blood cells cure cancer? No, does platelets cure cancer? No, does [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4296.0s)]
*  Neutrophils kill cancer? No, what kills cancer? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4301.82s)]
*  The natural killer cells and T cells so in that cbc there's a thing called the lymphocytes, correct? Do you look at that? No [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4305.76s)]
*  The only cell that is important that kills cancer [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4313.68s)]
*  99.9 percent of oncologists will say we don't pay any attention to that [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4318.96s)]
*  That um that that is a focal determine that does he mass backwards [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4325.84s)]
*  Why [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4330.5599999999995s)]
*  Why if you're not not to you know attack oncologists, but if you're fighting cancer, why do you ignore the one cell that fights cancer? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4332.16s)]
*  I'd love that's the experiment. I want this [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4340.4s)]
*  And that's a little mysterious am I missing something [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4345.28s)]
*  I'm missing something [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4348.639999999999s)]
*  Exactly [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4351.2s)]
*  That's the missing link the final frontier [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4353.04s)]
*  The e equals mc squared the god's equation [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4356.96s)]
*  That is the key element in your body that we've been missing for 50 years [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4362.0s)]
*  For 50 years, but it's even worse than that [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4368.16s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4372.08s)]
*  Those [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4376.32s)]
*  Missing link [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4377.84s)]
*  We've actually destroyed with chemotherapy [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4379.28s)]
*  We've destroyed with radiotherapy and we've just played with checkpoint inhibitors. We've destroyed with steroids [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4381.92s)]
*  Guess what we give to patients [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4388.16s)]
*  chemotherapy radiotherapy steroids and checkpoints [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4390.22s)]
*  Am I missing something? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4394.16s)]
*  I don't know anything about this, you know, I was a russian studies major [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4397.04s)]
*  I have no just because i'm 55. I know a lot of cancer patients [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4402.08s)]
*  I have always been skeptical that the protocol is effective based on so what I have noticed is [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4405.84s)]
*  Those therapies seem to beat back the cancer [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4411.92s)]
*  short-term [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4415.36s)]
*  But then so often you watch it come roaring back, you know, i'm in remission and then [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4416.8s)]
*  Wham you just get hit by a tidal wave of cancer and eliminated. So if you see my writings [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4421.92s)]
*  I have written so many times you win the battle and you lose the war [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4426.72s)]
*  So this is not i'm not imagining this you're not imagining that you win the battle and you lose the war [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4431.2s)]
*  The reason you win the battle is because you see this little blip of a response with chemotherapy [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4436.08s)]
*  And then the moment you stopped or not even again [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4442.719999999999s)]
*  You've actually now killed the cells that were there to protect you [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4445.76s)]
*  You've upregulated the suppressor cells and you get metastasis and you say, oops, sorry, you know, I have to go to hospice [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4448.8s)]
*  Think about that. That's what we've been doing for 50 years [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4456.96s)]
*  That's a dogma that i'm fighting [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4460.88s)]
*  So what okay, so let's just say I leave here and i'm diagnosed with you know, a serious life-threatening form of cancer [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4462.88s)]
*  What would you recommend I do next? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4470.88s)]
*  so [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4474.719999999999s)]
*  This is where you play chess and don't play checkers [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4475.84s)]
*  This is where you play go [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4479.599999999999s)]
*  Where you say, okay, what is the cancer doing first? Well, guess what the cancer is not stupid [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4482.08s)]
*  So is figured out a way to hide from these killer cells [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4487.52s)]
*  So the first thing you have to do is you have to expose the receptors on the cancers of the killer cells could recognize that [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4493.68s)]
*  So even in the presence of chemotherapy [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4501.68s)]
*  You don't use chemotherapy to kill [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4506.72s)]
*  the tumor [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4509.68s)]
*  You use a tiny dose of chemotherapy just to stress the patient the cancer [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4511.4400000000005s)]
*  And the cancer is oh my god, something's coming at me and it starts exposing itself [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4517.36s)]
*  So you go from high to expose [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4522.0s)]
*  so you use the chemotherapy at a low dose called low metronomic dose to [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4524.8s)]
*  Use it as what I call an immunomodulator [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4530.16s)]
*  Importantly wait, I was asking you're describing cancer. It's almost like an autonomous entity [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4534.22s)]
*  That has a goal a will to destroy the human body it does [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4540.16s)]
*  But that's I mean you're describing like a it's a machine [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4544.64s)]
*  But with it with intent [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4548.96s)]
*  And kind of clever behavior it hides like what you're describing like some for some like foreign entity in the body [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4551.36s)]
*  That's trying to kill the body. It is [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4557.76s)]
*  It's like a virus [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4559.92s)]
*  But how how can a tumor know to hide because it has genomic sequencing in there that actually blocks the expression [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4562.48s)]
*  so [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4569.36s)]
*  Which sounds diabolical it is diabolical [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4570.32s)]
*  That's why I spent 50 years trying to understand [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4573.22s)]
*  It's not a human brain [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4576.9s)]
*  It's biology and how biology can mutate and actually it's your body's a beautiful thing [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4579.22s)]
*  It's exquisite thing [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4584.98s)]
*  So it has to have these things called epigenetics [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4586.9s)]
*  So the it has the genomic sequencing that says i'm not going to express this so we can now [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4590.0199999999995s)]
*  stress that and block the the block and it now expresses [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4596.34s)]
*  Something on its surface that our t cells can recognize [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4600.98s)]
*  So that's the first step smoke it out smoke it out [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4604.5s)]
*  But your body has mechanisms to smoke it out [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4608.58s)]
*  It gets even more complicated [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4611.7s)]
*  Your body has a thing where you can induce what you call damps, which is damage associated [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4613.94s)]
*  Molecular patterns, but forget that it's a way of actually smoking it out. So now your t cells can recognize it [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4620.02s)]
*  Okay, so now you've done step one. That's just step one [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4626.42s)]
*  Step two is to have a tumor in your body [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4628.82s)]
*  That's one molecule so this is why I think the FDA needs to understand [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4631.46s)]
*  We're fighting a war where you need battlefield awareness all simultaneously where you have to orchestrate your marines your army or navy air force [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4636.58s)]
*  All in the right place [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4645.7s)]
*  So that you can use the tumor in your body [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4647.78s)]
*  to act as the weapon as the vaccine [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4651.38s)]
*  because the tumor [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4654.9s)]
*  Is far into the rest of your body and if you educate your t cells to recognize as molecules [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4656.34s)]
*  It's far into the rest of your body that t cell can remember [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4660.82s)]
*  Now you have a memory t cell [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4664.82s)]
*  So for the first time in 2024 in our package insert [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4667.3s)]
*  We have a molecule called the bioshield now i'll call it the bioshield that can activate the natural killer cell [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4671.22s)]
*  Activate the killer t cell and drive memory t cells [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4677.62s)]
*  We now have bladder cancer patients who would have lost their bladder in complete remission for nine years in cell life [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4681.78s)]
*  And so the protocol is you low dose you administer low dose chemo [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4689.54s)]
*  To identify where the tumor you smoke it out. You smoke it out, but at the same time [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4694.9s)]
*  You need to have the natural killer cells and t cells ready [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4700.259999999999s)]
*  So you give them the bioshield that upregulates and stimulates your natural killer cells and t cells [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4704.42s)]
*  What about radiation does that play a role? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4709.38s)]
*  That'll kill your natural killer cells and t cells. So now [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4711.86s)]
*  unless and this is comes out unless [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4715.06s)]
*  Today the radiation is what they call 70 gigabits. It's a giga [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4718.18s)]
*  Huge doses [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4722.58s)]
*  Unless you give a tiny little dose just to the tumor no else to smoke it out [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4724.26s)]
*  So you use radiation in a very different way called sbrt [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4730.1s)]
*  A low dose to identify rather than destroy to expose rather dispose [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4733.0s)]
*  So the algorithm is exposed from hide to expose [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4739.72s)]
*  The next algorithm alone is activate and proliferate your nk cells and that's what the subcutaneous injection [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4744.92s)]
*  The next algorithm is to educate your t cells with a vaccine that you anticipate that's going to be exposed [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4750.92s)]
*  So you now have educated t cells ready [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4759.08s)]
*  So you get educated t cells you got [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4763.0s)]
*  nk cells [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4765.8s)]
*  And the next thing is to activate your macrophages [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4767.08s)]
*  So they become killer macrophages [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4770.68s)]
*  And the next step is to suppress the suppressors [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4773.32s)]
*  You do that all simultaneously [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4777.0s)]
*  How much human suffering is involved in this there's a lot in a conventional course of cancer therapy all as an outpatient [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4779.16s)]
*  We've done hundreds of patients now [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4785.72s)]
*  So you're not so someone taking this course is not going to is he going to lose his hair throw up all as an outpatient [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4788.28s)]
*  What's even more exciting because that matters for cancer patients, I mean it's hard to be a cancer patient it's horrible [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4798.44s)]
*  Yeah [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4804.12s)]
*  But we've now seen patients now in complete remission [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4805.32s)]
*  More importantly, I want to treat patients before they need surgery [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4808.36s)]
*  So I could use the tumor itself in the body [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4813.08s)]
*  As the vaccine to educate the body and the t cells all about that tumor [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4816.68s)]
*  What's even more exciting now we can take blood from you one pint [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4825.16s)]
*  And extract the natural killer cell in the t cell and grow billions [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4830.84s)]
*  And store in crime preservation just like you do [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4836.04s)]
*  I don't know [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4841.32s)]
*  From cord blood [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4843.64s)]
*  We now have the ability [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4845.72s)]
*  To grow these natural killer cells and give it to anybody [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4847.64s)]
*  So I hope we said for the first time we could become the american red cross of cancer [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4852.04s)]
*  our country [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4856.76s)]
*  And use these innovations as foreign policy so could um [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4859.160000000001s)]
*  Looking back, do you think it was unwise to require the population to get the pfizer and moderna facts? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4866.04s)]
*  It depends on the time [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4873.56s)]
*  I think it's unwise to keep on giving this nonsense. I shouldn't say that I should be careful [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4877.4800000000005s)]
*  When I call it nonsense the idea of giving an antibody vaccine and then create another antibody vaccine another antibody vaccine that chases your tail [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4883.08s)]
*  I don't know what that's doing those spike proteins [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4892.68s)]
*  It's not ridding your body of cobit though, it's not [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4897.4800000000005s)]
*  Is it is it creating even more variants in your body? I don't know but is that possible [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4900.36s)]
*  I [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4908.04s)]
*  See the the the idea and i'm such a scientist [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4909.0s)]
*  I need to actually go and actually pull out these variants and sequencing them. That's what we do. Is it theoretically possible? It's theoretically possible [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4912.36s)]
*  Could there be um any change to a person's dna from taking well, that's what this does [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4919.96s)]
*  It's what the mrna vaccines do correct it converts into dna and it converts in replicating and that's what it does and it replicates [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4924.52s)]
*  An rna virus it becomes it's the virus someone who's clearly you've made reference to it a couple times interested in evolution. Um [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4932.120000000001s)]
*  To change [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4939.56s)]
*  The dna of a species is to change the species over time. No, I don't think it integrates. I my concern is it [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4941.240000000001s)]
*  This virus is all about the DNA of the species [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4945.400000000001s)]
*  No, I don't think it integrates I my concern is that this virus is all about itself [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4949.08s)]
*  It very selfish virus selfish virus. In fact, the fact that it is now [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4956.599999999999s)]
*  Less deadly is in the virus's interest. The virus doesn't want to kill you because you are the incubator [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4961.8s)]
*  Think about that [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4969.0s)]
*  The virus wants you alive [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4971.0s)]
*  You're speaking in a way that suggests intent and forethought. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4973.0s)]
*  It's biology, it's evolution. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4978.92s)]
*  Everything is evolution. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4981.68s)]
*  It was the intent to go from a tadpole to a human being. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4982.68s)]
*  I don't know, but to consider the possibility you have something, or the certainty that [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4987.76s)]
*  you have something within your body that is acting against your body's interest on purpose. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4991.76s)]
*  Yeah, because it needs you to be the incubator. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4996.2s)]
*  So you know the veracity when it was so man-made. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=4998.8s)]
*  So you know viral evolution, when it would have called affinity maturation, it matures [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5009.360000000001s)]
*  itself so that it can be more infective. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5016.04s)]
*  That's one thing it tries to do as a virus. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5018.92s)]
*  I mean, these viruses are living organisms. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5021.32s)]
*  And when you say living, they don't have brains or anything like that, but they have machinery [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5028.5199999999995s)]
*  that is very sophisticated. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5034.36s)]
*  They have what they call promoters and etc. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5035.36s)]
*  Why would you make something like that on purpose? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5038.16s)]
*  Well, there are viruses in nature, which theoretically will go through what you call maturation that [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5040.36s)]
*  normally do not infect you. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5048.0s)]
*  They not species, they species specific. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5050.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5053.4400000000005s)]
*  But why would you then change that? [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5054.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's what this, you know, gain of function study was so dangerous. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5057.8s)]
*  That's why it was prohibited. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5062.120000000001s)]
*  It's so self-evidently evil to even play with something like that with the potential consequences [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5063.240000000001s)]
*  which we're now seeing 13 year olds getting pancreatic cancer. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5069.52s)]
*  Like how could anyone do that? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5073.56s)]
*  And why aren't those people in prison? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5075.56s)]
*  Well, it was banned, right? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5076.88s)]
*  It was banned in the United States. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5078.68s)]
*  So we were on lab partnership. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5080.8s)]
*  Well, so we subverted it. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5082.28s)]
*  Now you talk about, you know, why is it so few people could home so many? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5083.8s)]
*  How they got around that is for the investigators to find out. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5088.5599999999995s)]
*  But I mean, you're someone who's created cancer drugs, who spent a lot of his life in a lab. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5094.04s)]
*  That's why you're a billionaire. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5100.84s)]
*  So you know a lot about this topic, obviously. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5102.88s)]
*  And it's clear to you that that's that's just too dangerous to be doing that, right? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5105.639999999999s)]
*  To take animal viruses and make them. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5110.0s)]
*  You can't control it. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5111.68s)]
*  Because you've done affinity maturation that would have taken tens of maybe millions of years. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5113.56s)]
*  In that fusion protein, they created this fusion protein and created and then then they [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5122.52s)]
*  created this vaccine. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5126.88s)]
*  I think I think Bonnie Graham was the part with Collins and everything else that was so [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5128.360000000001s)]
*  proud to create this R.B.D. and make it stable. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5132.88s)]
*  Think about it. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5136.56s)]
*  The spearhead, the tip of the spear that goes into your cell, we're going to make it stable. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5138.04s)]
*  That's why this vaccine was produced. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5143.2s)]
*  This was the M.R.N.E. vaccine was produced. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5145.28s)]
*  So you've taken a virus. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5149.56s)]
*  That's now gone from bats to man only because I think the skin of function work. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5153.92s)]
*  You then create a vaccine by taking the spearhead of this virus that is now being created to [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5159.88s)]
*  get into and make the spearhead even more stable and put it on the vaccine and says, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5166.2s)]
*  here we go. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5171.16s)]
*  This seems super crazy. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5171.96s)]
*  So just from the perspective of a layman again, if I've never had covid and I get the M.R.A. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5172.96s)]
*  you know, if I get the Pfizer vaccine, M.R.N.E. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5182.44s)]
*  vaccine, if I got it three years ago, can you detect covid in my body now? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5184.32s)]
*  Possibly. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5190.4s)]
*  See, that's like that's just crazy. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5191.639999999999s)]
*  Look, I know I'll be. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5193.639999999999s)]
*  I won't name her, but she. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5196.32s)]
*  Was a very senior person at the FDA. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5201.48s)]
*  And she just got the vaccine, that's it. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5204.679999999999s)]
*  And within weeks, she got brain fog, loss of memory. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5206.639999999999s)]
*  So there's clear evidence that sometimes the vaccine is the cause of sometimes the [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5212.719999999999s)]
*  virus is the cause. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5220.639999999999s)]
*  So that's what I'm saying. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5221.48s)]
*  It's it's not it's not mutually exclusive. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5222.28s)]
*  I understand. And it's it's. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5224.839999999999s)]
*  But it's all about the spike. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5226.639999999999s)]
*  But it's but the idea that you would be introducing the covid virus into a body that [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5228.44s)]
*  was not infected by the covid virus is like. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5234.919999999999s)]
*  Right. You went after the wrong protein, basically. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5237.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, I've been begging them to go after the nuclear capsid protein because the [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5241.08s)]
*  nuclear capsid protein, which is in the core of the of the of the virus, is not the [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5244.719999999999s)]
*  tip of the spear. Right. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5249.4s)]
*  And if you have a T cell, it lasts for 17 years. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5250.599999999999s)]
*  We know that from previous covid infections. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5253.16s)]
*  Yes. But they refuse to do it. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5256.04s)]
*  This seems like a human tragedy at like an unimaginable scale. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5259.88s)]
*  Completely. It devastates me. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5263.719999999999s)]
*  Well, that's incredibly bracing. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5269.0s)]
*  And I think you're one of the very few people I've ever met who has the absolute [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5271.0s)]
*  authority to speak on this. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5274.76s)]
*  And yet you've you've not been encouraged to speak about it, it sounds like. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5276.76s)]
*  I've not been what? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5282.92s)]
*  Encouraged to speak about it. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5283.76s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm not a political person and I have this bigger picture that we have [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5286.68s)]
*  to find a solution, not just for covid, but for cancer. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5293.68s)]
*  And the irony is this bioshield works for both. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5298.12s)]
*  And the only chance. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5301.84s)]
*  They're connected, it sounds like. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5303.08s)]
*  Completely connected. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5304.639999999999s)]
*  And the only chance we have now, because I had no idea that the political deep state [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5305.8s)]
*  was so powerful and so vicious and so egotistical that they would stop. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5313.36s)]
*  Good science. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5324.2s)]
*  So now I'm out there speaking because the drug got approved. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5326.8s)]
*  But that's not enough just for bladder cancer. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5332.0s)]
*  It has the same treatment effect for pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, triple [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5334.12s)]
*  negative breast cancer. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5338.88s)]
*  It is the only molecule for 50 years that upregulates these killer cells. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5340.360000000001s)]
*  Period. The missing link. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5346.2s)]
*  Well, you never got covid. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5347.68s)]
*  So that's you really never got covid? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5349.04s)]
*  Never got covid. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5350.4400000000005s)]
*  How many people do you know who didn't get covid? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5352.24s)]
*  Well, the president of the United States got covid like four times. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5355.4400000000005s)]
*  So if you did get covid, there's three antigens in the virus. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5357.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a spike, there's a nucleocapsid, and there's a thing called the M protein M. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5362.5599999999995s)]
*  And if you have, when you do your blood test, you can see if you have the M protein. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5369.959999999999s)]
*  If you have the M protein in your antibody or T cell antibody to the M protein, that [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5374.879999999999s)]
*  means it came from the virus. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5382.24s)]
*  If you have no M protein, it came from somewhere else. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5384.96s)]
*  It could come from the vaccine. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5389.32s)]
*  I have no M protein and I have T cells to N and have T cells to S. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5391.679999999999s)]
*  So you could basically lick a park bench and not get sick. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5399.24s)]
*  No, it doesn't exactly. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5402.639999999999s)]
*  So now you need to differentiate and not conflate the ability of the virus to infect. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5404.44s)]
*  It could still infect me. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5409.32s)]
*  But my body has the protection, the bioshield to clear it immediately within seven days. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5410.5599999999995s)]
*  Clear it. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5417.92s)]
*  Is this a lifelong protection? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5418.92s)]
*  Well, based on the science of the what they call MERS-1 where it was in 17 years is protection. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5420.599999999999s)]
*  That was the original coronavirus outbreak. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5428.44s)]
*  Correct. 17 years, this nuclear T cells is out there. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5430.12s)]
*  So I'll take that. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5434.2s)]
*  I'll take 17 years. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5436.719999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5437.719999999999s)]
*  And you can get a booster. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5438.72s)]
*  Now, what we're working on is a universal COVID virus vaccine for all coronaviruses [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5441.320000000001s)]
*  because it's N. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5445.84s)]
*  So what we did, oh, that's a good segue to that. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5447.320000000001s)]
*  So during my genomic sequencing, I was building the whole machine learning supercomputing [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5451.84s)]
*  network and I ran the national Lambda Rail for the God's particle and I built supercomputers [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5455.64s)]
*  and AI way before AI was. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5459.56s)]
*  And I presented the AI model to President Obama, believe it or not, in the one year [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5462.8s)]
*  model to President Obama, believe it or not, in the one pager for health care. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5466.48s)]
*  So our supercomputer, we combined ourselves with Microsoft so that we had the largest [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5471.679999999999s)]
*  GPU cloud during COVID. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5476.16s)]
*  And we were able then to actually look at the infectivity of every species, every [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5478.759999999999s)]
*  variant of COVID with every human type. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5485.599999999999s)]
*  There's a thing called HLA so that we could actually look at how the virus would change [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5488.32s)]
*  and avoid the T cells. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5493.16s)]
*  The only thing that it could never do was change the nuclear capsid and never could [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5495.52s)]
*  avoid the T cells. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5500.040000000001s)]
*  We made that software public at ISTL public and published it so that anybody could test. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5501.080000000001s)]
*  Based on your HLA, your HLA and my HLA type would be slightly different. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5508.56s)]
*  There's hundreds and thousands of HLA types and know whether this sequence, if you had [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5513.040000000001s)]
*  that sequence in your body would be protective. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5522.919999999999s)]
*  Through that, we are developing what we call a universal COVID vaccine, BioShield T cell [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5526.08s)]
*  vaccine, and we have it. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5532.759999999999s)]
*  But how do you do it? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5535.799999999999s)]
*  You know, so one of my thoughts was just to give it away to somebody. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5536.759999999999s)]
*  I actually offered to give it away to Regeneron and to Amgen way back, but they were too [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5543.0s)]
*  busy. Everybody was too busy during the COVID time. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5548.839999999999s)]
*  So one of the ideas now was for me to actually go to the Serum Institute in India and say, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5552.48s)]
*  yeah, please go build this and make this available to the world. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5557.799999999999s)]
*  So, you know, just so much we could do as an organization, we tiny little biotech company [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5562.48s)]
*  relative to the Merck and the Pfizer's. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5570.28s)]
*  But that's what my goal is. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5572.639999999999s)]
*  My personal goal is when you say I'm still doing it, I don't have a vineyard. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5573.919999999999s)]
*  The resources that was given to me as a God's gift, I believe that allowed me to do this. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5578.52s)]
*  So, you know, we have hundreds of employees, 40 acres of land in Los Angeles. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5586.360000000001s)]
*  The other tragedy was I took over this facility in Dunkirk that New York state had put [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5592.6s)]
*  two hundred million dollars in, completely empty, brand new, amazing facility for national [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5600.160000000001s)]
*  preparedness. And I called Chuck Schumer to help me make that available for the country. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5605.28s)]
*  Nothing. It's still sitting there, available for the country as a national [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5612.28s)]
*  preparedness manufacturing site in Dunkirk, New York, for which we put 50 million dollars in. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5618.04s)]
*  But there's no employees in there right now. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5624.48s)]
*  Nothing. It's crazy. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5626.8s)]
*  It is really ridiculous, right? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5628.639999999999s)]
*  Without leadership, without skill sets in leadership and without informed leadership, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5630.6s)]
*  how we as a country could go down the wrong path. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5638.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm so hopeful that these next four years could change that. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5640.84s)]
*  So this has been an amazing story. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5645.6s)]
*  You're obviously very famous in the medical research world and controversial. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5647.080000000001s)]
*  But I'm I'm I'm sold on what you said. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5654.280000000001s)]
*  So everything that you've done is, you know, you'll have a great obit because of it. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5656.76s)]
*  Then you decide to buy the L.A. Times in 2018 ish. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5663.08s)]
*  And, you know, owning the main newspaper in the country's second biggest town makes you [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5667.72s)]
*  obviously a media mogul, but it makes you a political figure as well. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5673.599999999999s)]
*  And L.A. is so complicated. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5677.28s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5678.639999999999s)]
*  Why would you? You don't need that. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5679.44s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5680.92s)]
*  Well, I think it really helps to know how I grew up, right? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5682.76s)]
*  So I grew up in South Africa as apartheid. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5686.24s)]
*  I because South Africa didn't have I did not see a TV until the age of 21, believe it not. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5689.64s)]
*  No TV. No TV. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5695.28s)]
*  South Africa didn't have TV. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5696.4s)]
*  So not a period. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5697.92s)]
*  We also it was just books and newspapers. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5699.88s)]
*  That was the only way I got educated books and newspapers. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5703.12s)]
*  To the extent that I would go every day as a newspaper boy to the printing press in [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5706.8s)]
*  Port Elizabeth, sit at the printing press, get the first one off the press, read it and then run [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5712.4800000000005s)]
*  with about two, three hundred papers throughout the city. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5718.32s)]
*  That would be what I did and grew up. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5720.64s)]
*  So I fell in love with the printing press, the clicky clack of the oil and the smell. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5723.76s)]
*  And when the opportunity came, remember, as I said, I had this amazing gift [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5729.68s)]
*  of the resources of selling these two companies that I never anticipated in life. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5735.68s)]
*  With Michael Farrow saying he took over this company called and then named it Tronk. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5743.2s)]
*  And he was going to shut down the Washington Bureau and move all the. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5749.280000000001s)]
*  So he owned the LA Times. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5753.84s)]
*  He owned the Tribune, actually, the whole thing. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5755.2s)]
*  Yeah, at that point. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5758.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5758.88s)]
*  Chicago Tribune, the Tribune Company. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5759.280000000001s)]
*  The whole Tribune Company, which included LA Times and San Diego Tribune. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5761.12s)]
*  And he knew how desperately I wanted the LA Times because I had helped him invest [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5765.4400000000005s)]
*  to buy the rest of the Tribune. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5772.16s)]
*  So I was a minority shoulder then. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5773.4400000000005s)]
*  And he came to me and said, hey, Patrick, you want it? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5775.92s)]
*  Here's the price. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5778.96s)]
*  You've got 48 hours to decide and it's 500 million dollars. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5780.0s)]
*  No due diligence. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5783.68s)]
*  No due diligence. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5785.6s)]
*  That's it. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5786.4800000000005s)]
*  And who would take that deal? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5788.400000000001s)]
*  Only crazy people. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5790.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5791.44s)]
*  It's half a billion dollars and you can't see the books. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5794.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5797.5199999999995s)]
*  Nor can you go visit the newsroom. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5797.919999999999s)]
*  Because on Monday, we're going to actually shut all that and move them all out. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5801.679999999999s)]
*  And I don't want you to talk to these people. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5806.32s)]
*  And you have until Monday to decide. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5808.719999999999s)]
*  And I was running a conference in LA with all my scientists and the [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5811.2s)]
*  National Cancer Institute and all the scientists were there at this hotel. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5815.44s)]
*  And I said, oh my God. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5818.719999999999s)]
*  So I went upstairs and we got a private room and I brought all the people into the room. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5819.76s)]
*  And I said, I want to do it. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5824.56s)]
*  And I called my wife. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5827.84s)]
*  I said, we want to do this. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5828.56s)]
*  I think this is an opportunity for us to have a voice for the people, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5829.76s)]
*  especially if they're going to shut down Washington and shut down LA. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5835.360000000001s)]
*  We'll never have a paper here. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5837.92s)]
*  This is one of the most important things. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5839.12s)]
*  So by Monday, I signed it and that was it. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5842.320000000001s)]
*  You paid him 500 million dollars? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5846.0s)]
*  500 million dollars. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5847.360000000001s)]
*  How grateful was he? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5848.88s)]
*  Very. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5850.48s)]
*  I'm sorry to laugh, but if you hadn't made so much money, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5853.5199999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't be laughing because it would be mean. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5856.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5857.679999999999s)]
*  But that's incredible. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5857.759999999999s)]
*  So Phil Anschutz saw me. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5859.759999999999s)]
*  I've got some stuff I'd like to sell you. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5861.36s)]
*  So Phil Anschutz saw me at the next Laker game. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5866.08s)]
*  He says, you know, Patrick, I always thought you're such a smart guy until yesterday. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5868.799999999999s)]
*  But you know, I have no regrets. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5874.88s)]
*  I think what I did then was said, okay, I'm going to take everything I know in [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5876.24s)]
*  healthcare, that rocket ship that I showed you and then create, because during that time, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5881.36s)]
*  Bezos would have this arc, he'd had the software and he had the Washington Post [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5887.76s)]
*  and his team came to see me and said, listen, we've got this arc software that we want to run. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5891.84s)]
*  I said, no, I don't like this old software. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5898.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm going to go build a completely new software content management system that could take [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5901.2s)]
*  podcasts, video, live streaming, because I want this newspaper to be an educational moment for [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5905.68s)]
*  people. And at the end of the day, a newspaper is not just a newspaper. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5912.400000000001s)]
*  It's a basis of engagement. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5916.240000000001s)]
*  I want to engage users as a tool to engage with people because that's how I grew up. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5918.8s)]
*  So we took the risk and we built this content management system took us five years [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5926.56s)]
*  and we launched it and which could talk to the printing press and talk to magazines. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5931.04s)]
*  It could talk to podcasts, it talked to video, talk to live streaming. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5935.6s)]
*  And now it's just gone live. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5939.76s)]
*  It's called LA Times Studio and LA Times Live. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5941.360000000001s)]
*  And the next thing we're going to do is called LA Times Next. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5944.400000000001s)]
*  And the LA Times Next and a gentleman called Eric Beach and I are forming so that we could [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5947.4400000000005s)]
*  create a platform that would allow voices to be heard and free speech to be heard unencumbered [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5954.8s)]
*  by either the opinion or news. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5963.200000000001s)]
*  So now we have three platforms. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5966.080000000001s)]
*  We have a platform of news, which supposedly is facts. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5967.6s)]
*  We have a platform of opinion, which are now changed to voices, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5971.360000000001s)]
*  meaning everybody should have a voice, whether you're right voice, left voice, central voice. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5975.52s)]
*  Do you like Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, whatever voice? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5979.76s)]
*  And then a complete platform that allows free speech [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5983.4400000000005s)]
*  and video, podcast. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5989.28s)]
*  And now I have that platform and we've built the infrastructure to accommodate that platform. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=5993.68s)]
*  And I'm excited by LA Times Next because we're going to have a studio in DC. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6000.0s)]
*  We have studio in LA. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6004.96s)]
*  We may have a studio in Nashville. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6006.0s)]
*  And shows like this are important because I believe long forms like this is how you [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6008.96s)]
*  communicate for people who are interested. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6016.88s)]
*  And it could be fun. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6020.5599999999995s)]
*  It should be engaging. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6021.5199999999995s)]
*  It should be interesting. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6022.88s)]
*  And that's why I bought the paper. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6024.88s)]
*  Well, those are great reasons as far as I'm concerned, but they come with them. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6026.08s)]
*  The purchase comes with it. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6031.92s)]
*  A lot of people who work at the paper. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6034.719999999999s)]
*  I've worked in newsrooms my whole life and I know that they hate change. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6037.84s)]
*  They hate the owner no matter what. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6042.4s)]
*  Everybody hates the owner just on principle. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6044.0s)]
*  There are a ton of unhappy people in journalism. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6046.96s)]
*  I would say the overwhelming majority are just for whatever reason we could speculate. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6049.04s)]
*  And they're very hard to manage. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6052.88s)]
*  And they're roughly about a hundred or maybe even more percent left wing everywhere, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6055.12s)]
*  including at supposedly conservative places that are all lefties. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6063.12s)]
*  So how do you deal with that? [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6066.32s)]
*  By being honest and transparent head on. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6068.96s)]
*  And I openly shared with them. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6071.76s)]
*  I said, listen, we cannot be echo chamber. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6073.5199999999995s)]
*  I won't tolerate it. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6075.2s)]
*  It's okay if you're left wing, but you need right wing. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6077.36s)]
*  So I offered Scott Jennings an opportunity to write on the paper. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6080.24s)]
*  And I said, we need all voices. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6086.24s)]
*  And so I said, listen, I don't know who made these rules because I came into this newspaper. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6089.36s)]
*  I don't know the difference between the columnist and op-ed editorial page and news. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6095.2s)]
*  And now when you're merging all of these, can you imagine the layperson? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6101.2s)]
*  Not really understanding the difference. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6105.04s)]
*  And I want you to say news is news and you, the newsroom. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6107.6s)]
*  Fine. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6111.36s)]
*  Theoretically, everything's edited. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6112.24s)]
*  You've checked it. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6114.96s)]
*  You fact checked it. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6115.84s)]
*  But when it comes to an opinion, I want to change that to call be voices. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6117.28s)]
*  And I want all voices to be heard, all American voices to be heard. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6122.48s)]
*  And you know, the Kamala Harris endorsement, I took a lot of heat because the editorial [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6128.0s)]
*  board resigned by my taking a stand that we cannot be an echo chamber of opinions, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6134.08s)]
*  not based on facts. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6140.16s)]
*  So just for those who didn't follow it, and it was quite a story for a couple of days there, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6141.5199999999995s)]
*  it was during the campaign, the editorial board, correct me if I'm wrong, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6146.64s)]
*  wanted to endorse Kamala Harris. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6150.8s)]
*  And you said, no, what did they say to you? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6153.84s)]
*  And what did you say back to them? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6157.04s)]
*  Well, I can't put in. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6159.84s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6161.28s)]
*  You've gone pretty far already. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6164.719999999999s)]
*  I can just say that we're not happy. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6167.44s)]
*  But what was their pitch like? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6170.32s)]
*  So the pitch was we as a board have met and we have this pre package. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6171.759999999999s)]
*  We know this is outrageous. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6177.04s)]
*  But this pre package, what does that mean? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6179.04s)]
*  We had a pre package endorsement. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6181.759999999999s)]
*  We mean pre package. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6183.84s)]
*  They already written it. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6184.639999999999s)]
*  After talking to Kamala Harris, never having met her. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6186.24s)]
*  They never met Kamala Harris. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6189.04s)]
*  Never met her. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6190.08s)]
*  Isn't the editorial board supposed to interview the candidates? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6190.72s)]
*  By the way, the editorial board never met even. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6193.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm on the editorial board. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6195.360000000001s)]
*  So I said, I'm with Kamala Harris was in LA all the time. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6198.400000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6202.400000000001s)]
*  In your neighborhood, actually. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6204.240000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6205.52s)]
*  Raising money, keeping the traffic in trouble, raising money. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6205.76s)]
*  And that's and I never met her and nor did the board even met. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6210.88s)]
*  And I said, this is unacceptable. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6216.240000000001s)]
*  And they know they, as you could see, because it's a left leaning, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6218.64s)]
*  they wrote terrible stories about President Trump, which is. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6221.6s)]
*  Had they met him? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6226.16s)]
*  Not met him either. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6227.44s)]
*  So my statement to them was, listen, you may have an opinion, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6229.2s)]
*  but all of us should have opinion based on facts. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6232.8s)]
*  I mean, one of the statements that came and I would name him, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6235.92s)]
*  came from a person that said within this concept that Vice President Kamala Harris, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6240.08s)]
*  was the most consequential vice president in the history of the United States. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6247.2s)]
*  So I said, no, I shouldn't lie. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6251.76s)]
*  I don't mean to be dismissive. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6253.36s)]
*  On what basis did the person say that? [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6255.44s)]
*  Having never met her and so now exactly you just hit it on the head. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6257.92s)]
*  And I said, on what basis do we say that? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6262.08s)]
*  What are the facts? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6265.12s)]
*  Can we actually show the record of that? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6266.4s)]
*  So I said, you know, it boiled down to look, we're not going to do that. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6269.84s)]
*  We're just not going to do it. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6273.12s)]
*  What did the person say when you asked? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6274.32s)]
*  On why are you saying she's most consequential vice president of the United States? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6277.679999999999s)]
*  Like what are the facts that underlie that judgment? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6280.48s)]
*  I obviously had disagreed with that person and there are no basis for that other than, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6286.4s)]
*  you know, as you said, a personal echo chamber, you know, and look, I think, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6291.92s)]
*  I don't know what they're trying to protect. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6298.08s)]
*  They're trying to protect. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6299.5199999999995s)]
*  And if I try to find, I'm trying to find the kernel of basis. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6301.599999999999s)]
*  The audience, because the audience is left, so they need to be left. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6306.96s)]
*  I don't think that's right. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6309.92s)]
*  I think meaning our audience. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6311.04s)]
*  We lost a lot of viewers, right? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6313.28s)]
*  I mean, thousands of people unsubscribed, but I don't think it's right that we should [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6314.72s)]
*  be this canceling society. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6322.32s)]
*  I think we should be a society that can have a civil discourse like we're having now [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6324.08s)]
*  and disagree. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6328.0s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6328.64s)]
*  And understand each other's point of view. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6330.24s)]
*  That's what I think is the value of the paper when you talk about voices. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6332.4s)]
*  So that's what I'm instigating now. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6336.16s)]
*  And so I've taken the opportunity. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6338.24s)]
*  Let's go back to the comma thing really quick. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6340.96s)]
*  So were they, they were shocked that you canceled that. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6342.64s)]
*  They were worse than shocked. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6346.24s)]
*  They resigned. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6347.12s)]
*  They resigned. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6348.24s)]
*  So I had three right now, 90% of my editorial board has resigned. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6349.04s)]
*  So where did they go? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6354.16s)]
*  Cause there are no editorial writing jobs left in the. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6355.44s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6357.76s)]
*  So look, I think it's important. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6360.8s)]
*  Look, the fact that I had the courage to resign, some of them know Kevin Murad. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6364.88s)]
*  I fired. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6370.88s)]
*  I fired Kevin before they resigned. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6371.52s)]
*  Why did you fire him? [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6374.32s)]
*  One, because of leadership too, because of. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6378.0s)]
*  I got to be careful. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6383.52s)]
*  I don't want to disparage him. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6384.32s)]
*  I fired him because I didn't believe he was the right person or creating, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6385.4400000000005s)]
*  taking the paper where it needs to be. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6390.96s)]
*  He was formally at the Washington post. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6393.280000000001s)]
*  Washington post. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6394.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6395.4400000000005s)]
*  I remember that well. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6395.68s)]
*  And then after that episode, the editorial board, the rest of them resigned. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6399.120000000001s)]
*  And now we rebuilding. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6405.52s)]
*  Look, we have to, we have to. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6406.64s)]
*  And what's exciting to me is I'm rebuilding with young people. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6408.96s)]
*  And what's exciting to me is this opportunity with LA Times next and [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6412.96s)]
*  LA Times studio and then the newsroom. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6416.160000000001s)]
*  Terry Tang is doing a fantastic job. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6419.52s)]
*  She's, she's, she's working hard to take on the people and the productivity. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6421.28s)]
*  The productivity. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6428.32s)]
*  Well, increasing productivity. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6429.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're employing journalists. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6432.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6435.679999999999s)]
*  So that's the world I understand. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6435.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6437.759999999999s)]
*  There are some productivity issues there. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6438.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6439.5199999999995s)]
*  When you write one slug a month, I think that's not going to be good. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6441.04s)]
*  Been there. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6444.48s)]
*  In there. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6445.44s)]
*  So it's been an experience, but look, we, we they're in for the long haul, I think. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6448.4800000000005s)]
*  And look, it's just not us, by the way, we got to save these local newspapers. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6454.64s)]
*  I agree. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6459.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6459.68s)]
*  We got to save the ability to have local discos. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6459.92s)]
*  Now with the LA fires, it's even more important. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6462.8s)]
*  Look, I called out Karen Bass and Gavin Newsom and these politicians, you know them both. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6466.08s)]
*  I know them both. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6472.32s)]
*  I text with them both and I complained to them both. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6473.04s)]
*  And what I tell the public is what I tell them. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6476.4s)]
*  So I don't say anything behind their back. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6478.88s)]
*  I personally say, I said, you're not doing the right thing. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6481.68s)]
*  Whether it be the homelessness or homelessness, they did a terrible job. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6485.6s)]
*  Completely wasteful job. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6489.68s)]
*  So these are the kinds of things that I think it gave us the opportunity to have a say in [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6492.0s)]
*  our community, you know, and that's what I'll continue to do. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6498.64s)]
*  Now we'll position ourselves in D.C. and I think the next four years will be [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6502.240000000001s)]
*  really, I hope, monumental. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6507.4400000000005s)]
*  Doctor, thank you for spending all this time. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6510.240000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6512.0s)]
*  No, it's been fun and a pleasure. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6512.240000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6514.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6515.280000000001s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6520.16s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6523.4400000000005s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6525.04s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right now. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6525.76s)]
*  All the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6529.6s)]
*  one the cusp of fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6533.84s)]
*  rather than more. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6539.120000000001s)]
*  That is totally wrong. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6540.4800000000005s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6542.400000000001s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6543.76s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6545.360000000001s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6546.72s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google or we could find a way around it, a way that you could [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6547.84s)]
*  actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6551.200000000001s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think it's to subscribe to our channel. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6555.200000000001s)]
*  Subscribe, hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6558.88s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6564.16s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgZaT-OriO8&t=6569.28s)]
