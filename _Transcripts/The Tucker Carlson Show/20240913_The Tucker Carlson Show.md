# Megyn Kelly Taylor Swift’s Extremist Transgender Ideology, Debate Reaction, & Cable News Collapse
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss)
*  I am genuinely honored to introduce Megyn Kelly, who I could talk for like an hour about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=0.0s)]
*  actually since I know Megyn Kelly really well. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=5.94s)]
*  And I would just say a couple things about Megyn Kelly. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=9.4s)]
*  Megyn Kelly, she was at the company that we once worked for. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=11.4s)]
*  It was a TV company based in New York City on Sixth Avenue. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  And I got there after being fired from a couple of different jobs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=19.48s)]
*  And so I was like totally powerless and, you know, disgraced. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=25.86s)]
*  I've had many firings, but I was in the middle in between firings at the time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=29.66s)]
*  And Megyn Kelly was the dominant person there because she was the most talented person in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=33.18s)]
*  the building, just like pure talent. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=37.980000000000004s)]
*  And Megyn Kelly, for reasons that I've never even asked her, I don't know the answer, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=40.7s)]
*  went out of her way to help me. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=44.14s)]
*  Like to such an extent, I didn't even really know Megyn Kelly, but Megyn Kelly went out [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  of her way, and I mean out of her way like at risk to herself, like in some meeting, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=50.7s)]
*  you know. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=55.18s)]
*  I don't know that guy, he's kind of a buffoon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=56.18s)]
*  No, he's good. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=57.18s)]
*  You should promote him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=58.26s)]
*  And I don't know, again, I don't know why she did that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=60.059999999999995s)]
*  Well, I do know why actually, because Megyn Kelly is actually a really decent person. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=62.22s)]
*  And if you're, which I shouldn't even have to say, but if you're a lawyer on TV, which [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=67.25999999999999s)]
*  she is, like you would not want to be cross-examined by Megyn Kelly at all. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=72.5s)]
*  That would be a nightmare. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=78.06s)]
*  You would lose, actually probably get the death penalty for whatever the offense. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=79.06s)]
*  I'm just late on my electrical bill. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=83.18s)]
*  To San Quentin, you know, she's tough. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=84.66s)]
*  It's really striking to see what a truly graceful and gracious person she is. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=87.72s)]
*  And I've just lived that firsthand. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=94.4s)]
*  She's also, you know, just the smartest and the coolest. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=96.84s)]
*  So with that, ladies and gentlemen, Megyn Kelly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=99.6s)]
*  This is cool. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=109.28s)]
*  Wow, this is so beautiful. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=110.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=114.28s)]
*  Can I say one other thing about Megyn Kelly before I let Megyn Kelly talk? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=118.28s)]
*  I'm not going to say much. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=120.8s)]
*  So if you spend your life in a studio, it's just so interesting. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=123.8s)]
*  You have total control over everything. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=126.68s)]
*  And most people who do that really don't like live events. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=128.2s)]
*  99%, in fact, the most talented people you know on television and radio do not like to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=133.04s)]
*  be in large rooms full of people because they're uncomfortable around people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=138.36s)]
*  Megyn is the exception to that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=142.48s)]
*  And I think it just shows her love of people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=144.44s)]
*  I just really noticed that today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=146.68s)]
*  Can you believe he didn't know why I kept telling them, Tucker's good. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=154.72s)]
*  He's the only one who doesn't understand that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=155.72s)]
*  It was obvious to anyone with eyes and ears what a star he was. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=158.56s)]
*  Whether it was Weekend Fox and Friends or in the prime time of Fox, always been a believer. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=163.68s)]
*  It was not obvious to everyone, I will say that, including some of my relatives. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=168.04s)]
*  But thank you so much. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=171.32s)]
*  It was obvious to the smart ones. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=172.32s)]
*  So okay, so I'm at lunch today. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=174.68s)]
*  We land, we're in Tulsa this morning, land here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  Within 30 minutes I'm at a barbecue place behaving like an animal. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=180.12s)]
*  Overeating, all kinds of stuff on my shirt. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=185.88s)]
*  I really disgraced myself. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=188.32s)]
*  I am going to tell Casey Means about this when I see him. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=189.32s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=191.0s)]
*  I have to get under control. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=192.0s)]
*  But this couple came up to me and they're like, oh, we just came from Dallas because [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=193.0s)]
*  we heard Megyn say, I said we're going to Dallas. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=197.28s)]
*  She's like, yeah, but we came to see Megyn. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=198.76s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  And they're like, you have to ask Megyn about Taylor Swift. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=201.44s)]
*  And no, this happened to me. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=206.32s)]
*  It's just this happened. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=207.84s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=208.84s)]
*  And I'm only dimly aware of who Taylor Swift is because I don't have a TV. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=209.84s)]
*  So I don't go on the internet much. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=212.2s)]
*  And then I come here and someone's like, are you going to ask her about Taylor Swift? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=214.12s)]
*  I've got thoughts. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=217.44s)]
*  So it's a sincere question. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=218.44s)]
*  Why are people telling me to ask you that? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=222.2s)]
*  And do you think Taylor Swift, who apparently endorsed Carmella Harris just the other day, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  will have, I know, wow, I know. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=229.32s)]
*  I'm not here to endorse Taylor Swift, trust me. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=231.6s)]
*  Will this have an effect? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=234.84s)]
*  What's the significance of this? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=235.84s)]
*  I don't know whether it will have an effect. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, supposedly some 350,000 people have rushed to some website to register to vote [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  or to express interest in potentially doing that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=245.28s)]
*  But young people don't generally vote. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=247.84s)]
*  And I don't think people who at this point in the election cycle had not registered to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=249.72s)]
*  vote are not going to do it because of Taylor Swift. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=253.28s)]
*  But let's set that to the side. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=256.72s)]
*  Screw you, Taylor Swift. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=259.92s)]
*  That's how I would like to begin. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=264.92s)]
*  This woman has got how, she's a billionaire. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=267.92s)]
*  I saw her amazing mansion in Rhode Island. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=274.68s)]
*  I went to some hotel there and there it is up on a cliff. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=277.68s)]
*  You've never seen a more beautiful home. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  It's one of what, 20? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=282.12s)]
*  She's got so many gifts thanks to all of you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=283.76s)]
*  Thanks to your daughters, who you probably had to drag to her concerts and you want to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=286.92s)]
*  make your daughter happy and so you did it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's true whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=291.32s)]
*  And how does she thank this nation? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=293.92s)]
*  She turns around. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=296.46000000000004s)]
*  Not only does she pick a side in a hotly contested presidential election, alienating at least [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=298.54s)]
*  half of her fan base, but she says the reason she's voting for Kamala Harris is because [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=303.42s)]
*  of Tim Walz's LGBTQ stance. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=309.66s)]
*  Do you know what Tim Walz has done on the LGBTQ front? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  Tim Walz. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=320.82s)]
*  Let me tell you what's going to happen. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=321.82s)]
*  Okay? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=323.9s)]
*  Here's what's going to happen. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=324.9s)]
*  A little girl sitting in Wisconsin who's maybe on the spectrum, maybe has acne, maybe [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=325.9s)]
*  is a little heavyset, maybe feels upset because her parents are getting divorced, something [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=332.94s)]
*  like that, is going to find herself down a rabbit hole on Reddit. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  And her parents aren't going to know because they're going to divorce and they're not [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=341.82s)]
*  focused on her right now. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=344.08s)]
*  And she's going to spend hour after hour on that thing and Reddit's going to tell her [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=345.08s)]
*  she's actually a boy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=348.53999999999996s)]
*  And she's going to get sucked into this gender cult and she's going to say, Mom and Dad, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=350.58s)]
*  I want puberty blockers and across sex hormones, which will sterilize her and deprive her of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  all sexual pleasure for the rest of her life. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=359.14s)]
*  And they're going to say, no, you're a girl. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=362.18s)]
*  And she's going to say, but I want top surgery, this benign thing, this double mastectomy [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=364.26s)]
*  where I'll have tubes coming out of me and I'll never breastfeed a child. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=369.06s)]
*  I want that too because I'm a boy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=371.5s)]
*  And they're going to say no. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=373.5s)]
*  And she's going to go to a judge in Minnesota and because of Tim Walls, the court will take [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=375.16s)]
*  custody of her, use the Medicaid funds in Minnesota to provide her all of those things, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  chop off her breasts, sterilize her with the puberty blockers and to the cross sex hormones. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  And when this girl inevitably comes to the conclusion that she didn't want any of this, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=392.78000000000003s)]
*  that it only added to her problems, which were the divorce and the acne and the puberty [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=396.72s)]
*  and not any trans issue. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=400.56s)]
*  Who is she going to go to then? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=402.96s)]
*  This is all because of Tim Walls. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=405.24s)]
*  That's what Minnesota is doing right now to little girls and boys taking custody away [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=407.36s)]
*  from the parents so that they can have these procedures without any loving parent there [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=411.34s)]
*  to help. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=415.52s)]
*  And that's what Taylor Swift just endorsed for your children. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=416.64s)]
*  So screw you, Taylor Swift. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=420.76s)]
*  That is, first of all, thank you for saying that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=425.2s)]
*  And pardon my ignorance, this is one of those topics that's so upsetting to me. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=431.44s)]
*  I have too many children, I think. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=434.64s)]
*  They can take custody? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=437.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=438.76s)]
*  There's a law that Tim Walls signed that says the court can take jurisdiction, which in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=439.76s)]
*  this instance means custody, over minor children who are not getting the gender affirming care, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=444.12s)]
*  which is a lie. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  There's only two sexes. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=452.7s)]
*  Gender's bullshit. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  There's men and there's women. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  One cannot become the other. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=456.28000000000003s)]
*  And he signed a law saying that they can take jurisdiction over minor children who are not [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=458.88s)]
*  being affirmed by their children and get all of those procedures done outside of any connection. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  Your parents will have nothing to do with it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=469.6s)]
*  They won't have access to you. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=470.8s)]
*  That's so dark. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=475.24s)]
*  I have to say, I look at you were describing how rich Taylor Swift is. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=477.56s)]
*  Why isn't she happy? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=482.24s)]
*  Good question. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, listen, there's, what is she, like 32? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=484.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what she is. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  She's young. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  She's never had a relationship that works. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  She makes a lot of money off of writing about it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=491.79999999999995s)]
*  That could be part of the problem. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=495.4s)]
*  Like for the reasons you were just discussing. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  When you find true love, when you have somebody who loves you unconditionally, warts and all, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=499.76s)]
*  that's everything. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=505.24s)]
*  And she hasn't been able to find it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=506.24s)]
*  She's made a lot of money off of it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=507.52s)]
*  And I think she travels from city to city without the grounding that you have, that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=509.44s)]
*  I have, that hopefully all of you have. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=513.96s)]
*  And maybe she's feeling untethered. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=516.32s)]
*  Maybe she's feeling empty and lost. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=518.32s)]
*  And maybe she wants other people to make similar decisions in life as she has. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=519.72s)]
*  Because people feel validated when you do that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=524.64s)]
*  And I think that's why she's misleading these kids. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=527.32s)]
*  She doesn't have the core that you should have. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=529.68s)]
*  Before you ever advise somebody on electoral politics. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=533.16s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=536.52s)]
*  I completely agree. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=538.28s)]
*  So it's a very dark day. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=539.64s)]
*  And I feel like she betrayed all the moms and dads who took their little girls there [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=541.08s)]
*  and fostered a relationship of fandom, not knowing that she would then turn around and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=546.12s)]
*  try to trans your kid or bless the man who's doing it, whether he's the Minnesota governor [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=551.12s)]
*  or God forbid the vice president. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=556.64s)]
*  Boy, you just made such a deep point, almost offhandedly as you do, almost parenthetically, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=558.04s)]
*  but that she doesn't have the grounding to be advising on a question like this. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=562.72s)]
*  Would you buy real estate from a homeless person? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  Or would you take investment advice from Bernie Madoff? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=569.76s)]
*  Like, why would I ever take an important piece of life advice from someone whose life is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  a disaster? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=577.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=578.44s)]
*  If she wants to tell me how to sing the song, I mean, okay, I guess I'll listen to that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=579.44s)]
*  But you know, I think it was a comedian, Andrew Schultz, who said, we'd just be so much better [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=585.0s)]
*  off if people would just do the thing they're supposed to do. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=590.2s)]
*  If the actor would just act and the singer would just sing and the basketball player [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=591.2s)]
*  would just play basketball. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't want her life advice on anything, but what's so pernicious about this is that [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=596.64s)]
*  we've inadvertently, thankfully not yours truly, but most parents with tween girls have [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=600.6s)]
*  inadvertently fostered a relationship between this person and their daughters and allowed [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=607.04s)]
*  her to become a role model to them. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=612.04s)]
*  And now she takes advantage of that by looking at these young girls saying, vote Harris-Walls [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=614.68s)]
*  because you can get an abortion at any age and at any term under them because you can [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=619.48s)]
*  turn into a boy under them because unlike what they said at the debate, you can try [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=624.56s)]
*  to abort your baby and it can be born on the table and we can just let it sit there without [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=630.12s)]
*  any medical care under Harris-Walls. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=633.3199999999999s)]
*  That is a thing, notwithstanding the fake fact check by ABC News. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=635.6s)]
*  It's sick. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=640.52s)]
*  It's hard to see though, Taylor Swift in isolation. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm just guessing here, but if she's really in her early thirties and she's made a billion [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=649.28s)]
*  dollars in the music business, I don't have a ton of her albums myself. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=652.44s)]
*  I can't even assess her music, but she's the product of a system and she's got to [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=657.2s)]
*  some extent to be acting on behalf of that, on the American entertainment system, which [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=662.6800000000001s)]
*  is to some extent a propaganda system. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=666.9200000000001s)]
*  This is an indictment of a whole industry kind of. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=670.0s)]
*  The problem with big movies and big rock and roll or records or pop is a lot of people [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=674.92s)]
*  who are drawn to those industries are empty inside to begin with. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=683.4s)]
*  We saw a flash of this in a brilliant moment at the Oscars this year where, to his credit, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  Robert Downey Jr. got up there and he won for best actor, I think, or supporting one [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=691.84s)]
*  or the other, for Oppenheimer. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=695.8s)]
*  The very first thing he said was, I'd like to thank my terrible childhood. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=698.12s)]
*  Some people are self-aware and they get through that. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=704.24s)]
*  The vast majority are not and do not. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=707.16s)]
*  They go to these industries like becoming a pop singer or becoming a Hollywood actor [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=709.6s)]
*  because they're seeking fame and to fill a void. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=714.48s)]
*  They think that these artifices are going to do it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=717.62s)]
*  If I can just become rich, if the people will just love me, if people will give me a golden [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=720.24s)]
*  statue, somehow I'll feel validated, like I matter. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=725.44s)]
*  None of the bad stuff that happened to me is consequential. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=730.52s)]
*  What they inevitably find is it fills no voids. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=734.28s)]
*  It only adds to their problems. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  All the emptiness is still there. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=739.12s)]
*  This is what happened to Matthew Perry, among many, many others. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=740.56s)]
*  I don't want to psychoanalyze Taylor Swift, but I don't think this level of fame is healthy [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=744.4s)]
*  for anyone. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=750.16s)]
*  We've started to make her some sort of an idol. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=752.0799999999999s)]
*  That's sick on our part. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=756.28s)]
*  I try to counter-program this with my kids all the time. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=758.36s)]
*  She's a singer. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  She sings some good songs. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=761.9599999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=763.52s)]
*  That's it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=764.52s)]
*  She's not someone to look up to. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=765.52s)]
*  Let this be a lesson to us all, that we don't foster that kind of a relationship with a [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=766.96s)]
*  stranger who's chosen to go into one of these very damaging industries because then they've [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=770.48s)]
*  got your kid in the palm of their hand and they can use that power for evil. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=775.48s)]
*  That is so wise. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=779.4399999999999s)]
*  Everything you've said is really wise. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=781.92s)]
*  I wonder why, I mean, you've just said directly or by implication more about what it takes [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=784.8s)]
*  to become fulfilled, what a full life actually looks like, that I've heard from any leader [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=791.48s)]
*  in our country, like maybe ever. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=797.1600000000001s)]
*  Why does no one ever get honest with people, no one with a position of authority or with [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=800.5200000000001s)]
*  a big audience about what it actually looks like to live a happy, fulfilled life? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=806.0s)]
*  We could have added politicians into our list of the people who go to Hollywood and the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=812.5200000000001s)]
*  rock and roll industry to become famous just as easily. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  This is one of the problems with our politicians today. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=823.5600000000001s)]
*  I was talking to the guys from the All In podcast, you know them, and they were saying, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=826.12s)]
*  name a politician you like. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  I was like, you're going to have to play the Jeopardy sounds. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=832.36s)]
*  It's really hard to think about somebody, yes, there are some, but you've got to really [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  think about it because we've created this congressional system that produces Kardashians. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=843.12s)]
*  It's people who want to become famous. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=851.0s)]
*  Look at AOC, she doesn't want to govern. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=852.72s)]
*  She wants to be famous, that's what she wants. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=854.88s)]
*  She's on Instagram all the time looking at herself, which is just the vainest app. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=857.76s)]
*  It's just the vainest of the apps because she wants you to be looking at her. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=861.88s)]
*  Half of them are posting pictures of their bottoms. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=865.5200000000001s)]

*  Please don't answer that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=873.24s)]
*  They're using it as a springboard for attention. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=877.08s)]
*  They don't actually want to govern us. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=880.24s)]
*  They want to parlay it into money and use all their followers and feel like they matter [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=882.72s)]
*  with their woke ideology because it's mostly on the left, there's some on the right. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=887.2s)]
*  That's why we have no one we can look up to. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=892.24s)]
*  There's no one in politics you should look up to. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=894.4s)]
*  We really need to look outside of it for our leaders. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=896.32s)]
*  You don't have to answer this question if you don't want, but just given the pretty [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=898.96s)]
*  amazing trajectory of your own life, you're a lawyer in DC, like an actual lawyer, not [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=903.24s)]
*  a TV lawyer, and then you become the most famous person in television. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=907.28s)]
*  That actually happened to you. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=913.4s)]
*  You became incredibly famous. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=914.6s)]
*  I don't think you set out to be, you're a lawyer. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=916.08s)]
*  Did that experience shape the views that you just articulated? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=919.04s)]
*  Yes, because I never was attracted to fame. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=923.16s)]
*  If anything, it was a downside of becoming more popular in what we do. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=928.72s)]
*  It's a blessing in some ways because people follow you and they show up and this is a [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=933.2s)]
*  blessing, but the downside is you lose your anonymity, you lose your privacy, and it's [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=937.32s)]
*  just another false idol. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=944.08s)]
*  You really can't fall into that because otherwise you become an ugly person. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=946.48s)]
*  You truly become an unattractive person. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=950.9200000000001s)]
*  As I became more well-known, Doug and I started to get invited to more fancy things, especially [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=953.96s)]
*  after that debate with Trump. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=959.2800000000001s)]

*  Remember that? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=962.32s)]
*  They started inviting me to all these fancy parties and I was like, sure, I guess I'll [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=963.32s)]
*  go to this huge Hollywood party and meet all these A-list stars and see what that's like. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=967.96s)]
*  I'll tell you what it was like. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=972.64s)]
*  Torture. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  It was torture. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=975.84s)]
*  I felt around them the same you guys would feel around them. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=977.76s)]
*  I didn't know what to say to them. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=981.2800000000001s)]
*  I had absolutely nothing in common with them. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=982.8s)]
*  It seemed like a bunch of vapid, empty people who only wanted to sneak a peek around me [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=985.04s)]
*  to see who else was there or over there in the mirror. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=989.72s)]
*  There was absolutely nothing of consequence to discuss with anyone there. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=993.76s)]
*  They're obsessed with their latest movie or what role they might get nominated for. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=997.64s)]
*  All I could think was, where is the accountant who planned this thing who will talk to me [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1000.88s)]
*  like a real person? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1005.48s)]
*  I didn't enjoy it and I recognized that it was false, that it wasn't real. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1008.0s)]
*  I was always very glad that I had Doug with me for these events because he's very grounded, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1012.4s)]
*  very normal. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1016.52s)]
*  I would say one of the biggest blessings of that period of my life ending was getting [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1018.24s)]
*  away from those people. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1023.36s)]
*  You didn't feel ... That's just interesting because a lot of people who go through different [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1025.56s)]
*  periods of their lives, they're always hoping to get back to the Oscar party. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1030.32s)]
*  Oh, God, no. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1034.28s)]
*  Oh, God, no. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1035.28s)]
*  No. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1036.28s)]
*  I went ... This is another one. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1037.28s)]
*  I went to the Met Gala, Anna Wintour. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1039.72s)]
*  You could freeze ice on her ass. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1044.2s)]
*  She had me meet with her at her tower downtown before this event. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1049.1200000000001s)]
*  She thinks she's a head of state, this woman. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1054.48s)]
*  I'm walking down the hallway to go into her suite and you've got 10 guys with the Janet [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1056.92s)]
*  Jackson headset and she's, we're walking, we're 10 feet, we're five feet. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1062.84s)]
*  No one wants to kill Anna Wintour, so just stop. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1068.04s)]
*  You get in there and she's of course eating two peas because she has to absolutely know [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1071.76s)]
*  you're not allowed to have any body fat and fashion. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1075.84s)]
*  Then she starts lecturing me about politics, trying to figure out whether I'm pro-life, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1080.04s)]
*  trying to figure out whether I'm pro-jurisd... [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1083.48s)]
*  What business is yours? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1085.0s)]
*  Anyway, it was painful and the Met Gala was downright painful and all these celebrities [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1087.8799999999999s)]
*  who are all over the Oscars and these Academy Awards and Golden Globes lecturing us on how [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1092.8s)]

*  All names you would know. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1107.36s)]
*  Smoking in the Met with some of our most precious works of art are absolutely, totally disrespectful. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1109.6s)]
*  What I realize is these people are disgusting. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1115.6399999999999s)]
*  What I want to do is go home right now and talk to my neighbor who's a fireman and the [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1119.0s)]
*  lady across the street who's a teacher and touch grass and get back to actual people. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1123.2s)]

*  Not I mean, Jeffrey Epstein liked young girls, but he didn't like eight year olds. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1290.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1294.96s)]
*  I think that there are multiple people in the Hollywood industry in particular who do. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1296.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1300.0s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1301.0s)]
*  And I think the same people who are behind some of the films that we see right now where [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1302.56s)]
*  this starts to get normalized in a way where, you know, there's a lot of sort of messaging [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1306.24s)]
*  in these films. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1311.28s)]
*  You can't avoid it like more and more. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1312.28s)]
*  It's getting shoved down your throat. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1313.88s)]
*  They start with like gay romances in your face all over Broadway, like deep tongue kissing. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1315.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1322.2s)]
*  I love my gay friends, but that's a lot. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1323.2s)]
*  And then next thing you know, every man turns into a woman in these productions, whether [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1325.68s)]
*  it's Hollywood or on the big stage. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1329.3600000000001s)]
*  And it's not that you have to be a pedophile to be, you know, or you have to, it's not [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  like gay people are more likely to be pedophiles. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1334.4s)]
*  But if you see these guys who are trying to change the messaging on pedophilia, they use [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1336.5600000000002s)]
*  our openness to people who happen to be LGBTQ as the window to get in. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1341.8s)]
*  Like, we're just on that spectrum. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1346.28s)]
*  That's just us. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1348.0800000000002s)]
*  We're just minor attracted people. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1349.0800000000002s)]
*  It's nothing to worry about. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1350.88s)]
*  Like, it's just another fetish. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1351.88s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1353.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1355.2800000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's dark. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1355.8000000000002s)]
*  So I do think it's much more widespread than people understand. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1357.24s)]
*  And I had Corey Feldman tell me that directly in a heated conversation I had with him five [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1362.3200000000002s)]
*  years ago. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1366.3200000000002s)]
*  Heated in what way? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1367.3200000000002s)]
*  He wanted people to talk about this. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1369.02s)]
*  You know, he grew up as a child actor. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1371.68s)]
*  You saw what happened with Nickelodeon. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1373.76s)]
*  You know, I had some of those kids on my show. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1375.96s)]
*  They grew up at this, with Nickelodeon. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  Who didn't have their kids watch Nickelodeon? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1379.4s)]
*  Did you have any idea it was such a perv fest? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1381.4s)]
*  With these people taking advantage of young kids and, like, pedophile after pedophile and, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1384.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, child pornography. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1388.04s)]
*  It was absolutely disgusting. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1390.1999999999998s)]
*  What a place to send your child. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1391.4799999999998s)]
*  And the people running it accused of pushing these disgusting messages into our kids' television [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1393.1999999999998s)]
*  programming. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1399.32s)]
*  You look at what that guy did to Ariana Grande when she was a star on Nickelodeon. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1400.32s)]
*  Completely sexualized this girl when she was 15 years old, writhing around on the bed like [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1404.36s)]
*  she was a porn star. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1408.4399999999998s)]
*  So I just think there are a lot of perverts out there who control a lot of our media, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1410.32s)]
*  whether it's the small screen or the big screen. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1415.24s)]
*  And this is all part of, in a way, it's like grooming us. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1417.6399999999999s)]
*  Getting used to this kind of stuff. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1421.08s)]
*  So when they take the next step, we're okay with it. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1423.5s)]
*  And not to mention, what's happening in our children's libraries at school, right? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1426.1799999999998s)]
*  So I keep reading that there's, like, a book burning campaign against great children's [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1431.2s)]
*  literature. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1435.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1436.48s)]
*  No. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1437.48s)]
*  I mean, if great children's literature includes this stuff, we're in a lot of trouble. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1438.72s)]
*  One of the most disgusting things I've seen all year is 60 Minutes when they had on Moms [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1445.44s)]
*  for Liberty and Scott Pelly, who is a disgusting, dishonest broker, tried to tell... [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1448.94s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1455.28s)]
*  Did you say, and I think I'm quoting, Scott Pelly is a disgusting, dishonest broker? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1456.28s)]
*  Correct. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1460.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1461.32s)]
*  He's about as honest as his friend Leslie Stahl, who said, the laptop can't be verified. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1462.32s)]
*  It can't be verified. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1465.52s)]
*  So he's got the Moms for Liberty gals there, and he's trying to tell them that we are [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1467.66s)]
*  not seeing books in K through 12 education that talk about, forgive me, anal sex. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1471.9s)]
*  That talk about the specifics of heterosex. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1477.98s)]
*  That offer absolutely disgusting sex tips to kids who are 10. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1481.24s)]
*  And I've seen it with my own eyes. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1486.1000000000001s)]
*  You guys have seen enough of this out there with parents' outrageous school board meetings [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1487.7s)]
*  raising hell over this to know Scott Pelly has his head up his rear end. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1491.3000000000002s)]
*  It's happening, and his denial is hashtag part of the problem. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1496.18s)]
*  So I mean, you've spent now, I think, a couple of decades in or around the American news [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1500.5800000000002s)]
*  media. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1507.6200000000001s)]
*  How is... [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1508.6200000000001s)]
*  So when you first got into it, contrast the opinions you had of it then to the ones you [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1509.6200000000001s)]
*  have now. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1513.46s)]
*  What are your conclusions? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1514.46s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1515.46s)]
*  I mean, so much has changed. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1516.46s)]
*  I mean, when I got into news, it was 2003 or 2004, and I was an unhappy lawyer. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1517.46s)]
*  I was done with the law, and I just wanted to try broadcast journalism. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1525.3000000000002s)]
*  Thought it would be really fun. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1528.5s)]
*  Thought it would use some of my skills. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1529.5s)]
*  So I didn't care. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1531.66s)]
*  I was like, I got my interview at Fox, and I went in, and Roger Ailes' number two guy [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1532.66s)]
*  was like, everyone wants to work for us now that we're number one. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1536.14s)]
*  I was like, they're number one? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1540.22s)]
*  Holy shit, I'm never going to get this job. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1541.98s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1543.8600000000001s)]
*  I didn't care. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1545.3400000000001s)]
*  It wasn't about ideology. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1546.3400000000001s)]
*  I didn't, you know. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1547.3400000000001s)]
*  So I didn't know much. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1548.8200000000002s)]
*  I didn't know much about the news. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1550.46s)]
*  I wasn't political. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1551.5400000000002s)]
*  When I was a lawyer, you have no time to be anything other than a lawyer. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1552.74s)]
*  You're not thinking about politics unless you're a true DC lawyer, like a lobbyist. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1556.02s)]
*  I was a litigator trying cases for big corporations. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1559.42s)]
*  And so it wasn't until I started getting, you know, neck deep into it that I realized [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1563.22s)]
*  how things worked. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1567.14s)]
*  And thankfully, I did grow up at Fox, so I never had the left-wing indoctrination shoved [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1568.7s)]
*  on me. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1573.18s)]
*  And then in the past five to 10 years, the ground has shifted under all of our feet, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1574.74s)]
*  I used to consider myself, you know, center right, moderate. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1580.6200000000001s)]
*  And now if you take one of those tests, what are you online? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1585.98s)]
*  I'm a far right conservative. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1588.98s)]
*  This is what happens. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1590.8600000000001s)]
*  I actually think the term is dangerous extremist. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1594.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a dangerous, yes. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1596.26s)]
*  So I threat to democracy. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1597.74s)]
*  Nice to see you here. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1599.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, I definitely am. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1600.3000000000002s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1604.42s)]
*  So is that that you've changed? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1605.42s)]
*  I mean, you've seen a lot, a lot. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1606.9s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1609.42s)]
*  Or that the definitions have changed. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1610.42s)]
*  Tucker, let me I'll give you one example. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1612.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, I used to fall for believe in some of the woke nonsense that's being shoved on [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1615.18s)]
*  our throats now, when it was just baby level, right? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1623.1000000000001s)]
*  Now it's like grown into huge monster level. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1627.66s)]
*  But I was one of the people on Fox defending the whole transgender thing back in like 2013. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1630.5400000000002s)]
*  That's because like most people, I wanted to be empathetic. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1639.18s)]
*  I didn't want to be nasty. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1641.94s)]
*  I didn't want to be bullying. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1642.94s)]
*  And it was a very small problem back then, which so this seemed like an appropriate reaction [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1644.46s)]
*  to it. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1648.7s)]
*  Same thing on the race stuff. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1650.3s)]
*  You know, I would get very upset when they would attack me for being an alleged racist. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1652.06s)]
*  You know, one time there's a whole bunch of articles about me being an alleged racist [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1657.3799999999999s)]
*  because I saw these gangs beating up a woman and I said, these are thugs. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1660.58s)]
*  What a bunch of thugs. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1665.06s)]
*  I gave you a week of media stories about what a racist I was. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1666.9399999999998s)]
*  I was rattled. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1669.4599999999998s)]
*  I was upset. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1670.74s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, I guess I can't use the word thug. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1671.74s)]
*  I mean, now I'm like, they're thugs. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1673.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1676.06s)]
*  It's like it takes a while. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1677.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1678.54s)]
*  So I needed that thicker skin. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1679.54s)]
*  And on the gender stuff, I mean, I've completely reversed myself and I see it entirely differently. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1681.6999999999998s)]
*  So it's just with some growth and while they've gotten more pernicious and I've been paying [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1686.3799999999999s)]
*  attention, my worldview on these issues has entirely changed. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1691.82s)]
*  Well, but I would also say that like a lot of people, I bet a lot of people in this room, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1694.22s)]
*  you had your decency leveraged against you. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1699.14s)]
*  You know, you had the moral advantage, but the political disadvantage of really sincerely [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1704.38s)]
*  wanting to be a good person and not hurt someone's feelings. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1709.44s)]
*  I mean, this is like the way that people who are trying to be good people think. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1712.8200000000002s)]
*  Like I don't want to hurt anyone else. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1717.46s)]
*  I don't, you know, there are a lot of hurting people out there. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1719.42s)]
*  I don't want to make it worse. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1721.3400000000001s)]
*  Like you really try to be decent and they take that instinct and they use it against [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1722.38s)]
*  you. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1728.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1729.42s)]
*  And then you learn there's no amount of subjugation that is okay for them. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1730.42s)]
*  You must be on your knees forever. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1736.0600000000002s)]
*  And I do think one of the reasons why, wait, can you stop and explain that a little more? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1739.18s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1744.2600000000002s)]
*  There's no enough. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1745.2600000000002s)]
*  There's not enough ring kissing that you can do because even if you kiss the ring, I mean, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1746.2600000000002s)]
*  let's go back to the Trump thing. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1751.74s)]
*  So the left loved me after that Trump debate and they thought that I was secretly, you [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1753.3s)]
*  know, a Trump hater, that I was a wolf in sheep's clothing at Fox News and I was going [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1756.94s)]
*  to take down the Republican party. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1763.42s)]
*  All I wanted to do is ask a really hard debate question. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1765.9s)]
*  And I asked one of him and I asked one of everybody, just like I had done it all the [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1768.46s)]
*  presidential debates that I moderated. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1771.26s)]
*  So then they started to love me, right? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1773.98s)]
*  They're like, oh, we love you. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1775.38s)]
*  We love you. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1776.38s)]
*  And then I got a job offer at NBC and for all sorts of reasons I left because my time [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1777.38s)]
*  at Fox was done for a number of reasons, some of which you may have read about in the paper. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1780.7s)]
*  And so I go over to NBC and one of the first things I said to them was, just in case you're [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1784.7s)]
*  thinking I am a secret liberal waiting to let my liberal flag fly, I'm not. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1789.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm exactly who you saw me on the air as. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1797.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm somebody who's more center right in my political beliefs, but I try to play [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1800.18s)]
*  it straight on the air. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1804.1000000000001s)]
*  Fine, fine, fine. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1805.5400000000002s)]
*  Do you think that that was my experience when I went over there with those leftists? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1807.06s)]
*  That was not my experience. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1811.3799999999999s)]
*  But having said that, that experience was a gift to me, such a gift to me. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1812.62s)]
*  I learned so much and not just about like, okay, I got fired. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1817.58s)]
*  So I learned things, although I technically wasn't fired. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1821.72s)]
*  My show was canceled, but the rest remains a matter of contract mystery. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1825.4199999999998s)]
*  Been there. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1828.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1829.98s)]
*  But I learned this lesson. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1830.98s)]
*  I learned this lesson. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1833.94s)]
*  And I'll take you back to the whole blackface controversy, okay, if I may. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1835.56s)]
*  So the reason my show ended is because we had a conversation on the air about blackface [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1839.42s)]
*  Halloween costumes and I was saying, you know, when did it become racist? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1843.3s)]
*  Because when I grew up in the 70s, and I remember this was on TV, it was on the movies, it was [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1846.02s)]
*  on like the Christmas specials. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1850.5s)]
*  Like, I had seen it. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1851.5s)]
*  It wasn't clearly something that all of society was saying, don't do this. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1852.9s)]
*  Not talking about minstrels face blackface, but talking about these Halloween costumes. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1856.5800000000002s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1861.46s)]
*  That's all I said. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1862.46s)]
*  And that was the cardinal sin. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1863.82s)]
*  So you didn't burn a cross on this at all? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1865.54s)]
*  That's not true? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1868.06s)]
*  No, no. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1869.06s)]
*  And by the way, NBC was airing like four shows within two years of that comment with people [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1870.06s)]
*  in blackface. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1873.6599999999999s)]
*  So okay, I've never worn blackface. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1875.5s)]
*  I was just trying to have a conversation, but that's irrelevant. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1877.46s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is I learned that these people are not sincere brokers. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1880.6599999999999s)]
*  They're not actually outraged over anything I said. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1889.22s)]
*  Or Joy Behar would be fired over ABC News because she put her blackface pictures on [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1891.8600000000001s)]
*  the air and celebrated it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1896.9s)]
*  I could go down the list. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1899.9s)]
*  Ted Danson, who was starring on NBC at that moment in a show about heaven and hell, he [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1900.9s)]
*  wore minstrel show blackface. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1906.78s)]
*  Whoopi Goldberg wrote the skit for him and she too was a host on the view over at ABC. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1908.7s)]
*  Scrubs, a couple of people wore blackface on the air and they were... [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1912.66s)]
*  We could go down the list. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1917.02s)]
*  So for me it was very eye-opening because at first my instincts were I should go back [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1918.58s)]
*  out on the air and I should explain to people, no, no, no. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1923.22s)]
*  Don't be offended. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1927.9s)]
*  I can show you all these examples of what I'm talking about. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1928.94s)]
*  I'm not endorsing it. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1931.54s)]
*  I'm saying I noticed it and it changed. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1932.58s)]
*  And I realized what are you doing? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1935.54s)]
*  These are not people who are honestly mad at you for what you said. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1938.74s)]
*  They're mad at the voice you've been bringing because you probably didn't watch my show [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1943.94s)]
*  at NBC. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1948.3s)]
*  Nobody did. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1949.3s)]
*  But I was saying conservative things. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1950.3s)]
*  I was defending Brett Kavanaugh to the hilt. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1953.74s)]
*  I was merciless on these stupid gang rape accusers and all that BS. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1957.18s)]
*  And I do think people were starting to recoil. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1963.5s)]
*  I attacked Jane Fonda brutally on the air in a 20-minute monologue. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1965.8600000000001s)]
*  And so what they wanted was my ruination. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1972.02s)]
*  And you cannot bargain with those. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1975.6200000000001s)]
*  So no amount of on-the-knee apologies, playing their game, trying to get along or just be [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1977.42s)]
*  a nice person who tried to look inside and say, what did I do? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1983.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm willing to self-examine, would advance the ball at all. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1987.18s)]
*  And then you finally, if you go through something like that, graduate to the point of not giving [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1992.94s)]
*  a damn what they say about you. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=1998.3s)]
*  And it is liberating. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2000.9s)]
*  This is something he knows nothing about. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2006.34s)]
*  I can just say, having spent many, many, many years in television, I've never seen crueller [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2009.22s)]
*  or more deceptive behavior toward anyone than what they did to you at NBC. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2015.58s)]
*  And I used to work there. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2018.98s)]
*  And I know that they're loathsome. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2020.06s)]
*  I didn't realize they were that loathsome. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2021.26s)]
*  But it sounds like you're saying it's worth the suffering to arrive at that point of liberation. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2024.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2031.5s)]
*  So that's in the personal and professional lane, that word liberation. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2032.5s)]
*  But I also needed the growth. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2037.3s)]
*  I needed the life lessons. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2039.86s)]
*  And this is one of the reasons why I do believe in cancel culture. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2042.2199999999998s)]
*  I believe in my being canceled and I believe in you being canceled. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2044.52s)]
*  I enjoyed it. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2048.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2049.74s)]
*  Because ultimately it separates you from a company that you did not belong at for whatever [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2050.8999999999996s)]
*  reason. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2055.66s)]
*  The value systems are different. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2056.66s)]
*  And once you get through the trauma, when you're going through trauma, you're not thinking [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2058.66s)]

*  reflect on what did it mean for me? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2066.66s)]
*  What did I learn from it? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2068.54s)]
*  And I could say the same thing about Fox in my last couple of years there. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2069.9399999999996s)]

*  I've gotten closer to who I really am and it's forced me to examine my own values in [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2083.18s)]
*  a way few events will. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2088.06s)]

*  Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile want you to believe that you have to have something called unlimited [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2100.62s)]

*  But for most people, you do not need unlimited data and you certainly shouldn't be forced [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2111.1800000000003s)]

*  I've ever watched. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2207.06s)]
*  Let's just game out. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2208.8599999999997s)]
*  Not Jeffrey Tubin? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2211.14s)]
*  No. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2212.14s)]
*  He's better on Zoom calls. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2213.14s)]
*  But uh, he's, what a filthy, and not just because he's just a filthy person in every [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2216.94s)]
*  way but um. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2225.1s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2226.1s)]
*  It's really. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2227.1s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2228.1s)]
*  So let's just say, so Trump is at least tied I think up in the electoral count as of today. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2229.1s)]
*  That's my belief based on the numbers that I saw this morning. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2242.46s)]
*  Let's just say that, you have no idea, none of us knows what's going to happen, but let's [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2245.9s)]
*  just say that holds and he wins the election first Tuesday in November. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2248.26s)]
*  Which I personally think, I'm terrible at predictions, I'm always wrong, but if I had [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2255.94s)]
*  to bet money on it, I would bet that happens. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2260.7000000000003s)]
*  What happens then, legally? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2263.78s)]
*  With the law fair? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2265.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2266.86s)]
*  Well, first of all, I know you're going to talk to Charlie Kirk and you should definitely [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2267.86s)]
*  be asking him about the ground game because there's a lot in his hands. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2270.54s)]
*  Thank God for Charlie Kirk. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2275.3s)]
*  No, but honestly this applies to all of you because the Democrats get out the vote effort [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2276.3s)]
*  is second to none. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2282.7000000000003s)]
*  And there cannot be any complacency. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2284.86s)]
*  None. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2287.34s)]
*  It really is tight. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2288.38s)]
*  I think Politico had a headline the other day like, knife fight in a phone booth, and [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2289.38s)]
*  it is that tight. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2293.5800000000004s)]
*  So everybody, it can't be in Charlie's hands, it can't be in Trump's hands. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2295.38s)]
*  And especially in anything resembling or near a swing state. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2299.7400000000002s)]
*  What happens if he wins is the January 6th litigation and the Mar-a-Lago litigation go [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2304.78s)]
*  away instantly because he'll be in charge of the DOJ and he'll pull those attack dogs, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2310.58s)]
*  Jack Smith and his cohorts, off of those cases and they're dead. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2315.5s)]
*  They're dead. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2318.62s)]
*  They're not going to be resurrected. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2319.62s)]
*  So then we have Georgia, which is going to go away because Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2321.1s)]
*  couldn't keep it in their pants. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2325.02s)]
*  So I think she's going to be disqualified on this appeal. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2327.38s)]
*  The trial court judge did not disqualify him or them, but he begged. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2330.7799999999997s)]
*  If you read that opinion, he begged. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2334.9799999999996s)]
*  He said, oh please, please. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2335.9799999999996s)]
*  The stench of mendacity fills my courtroom. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2338.2599999999998s)]
*  An actual phrase from his opinion. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2341.22s)]
*  Not disqualifying. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2343.66s)]
*  He's an elected official. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2344.66s)]
*  She's very popular. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2346.14s)]
*  It's Atlanta region. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2347.14s)]
*  So this appellate court, all three of whom are Republican judges, are going to disqualify [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2350.1s)]
*  her. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2354.5s)]
*  I'd be stunned if I'm wrong. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2355.5s)]
*  So that case is going away because there's not going to be another prosecutor who will [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2357.02s)]
*  take it. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2359.18s)]
*  And that leaves us with New York and our old friend Alvin Bragg. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2361.1s)]
*  And I understand, yes, boo. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2366.1s)]
*  And you can, we can keep it rolling for all those Soros prosecutors who don't want to [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2368.98s)]
*  prosecute any crime unless your name is Donald Trump. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2372.14s)]
*  Alvin Bragg has gotten his conviction. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2376.8199999999997s)]
*  They're going to have a sentencing at some point. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2380.18s)]
*  Right now it's set for after the election. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2383.22s)]
*  And I think the worst case scenario for Trump now is jail time with a suspended sentence, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2385.4s)]
*  meaning he won't have to serve it until an appeal goes up. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2391.84s)]
*  And I think there's no chance that this conviction is going to stand because the Supreme Court [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2394.96s)]
*  ruled in that immunity ruling. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2400.28s)]
*  You guys know about that, right? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2402.04s)]
*  They said not only can you not go after a president criminally for most of his official [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2404.0s)]
*  acts, but in any case against him, you can't introduce evidence of what he did while in [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2407.96s)]
*  the Oval Office. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2413.28s)]
*  Well the Alvin Bragg prosecution did a lot of that. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2414.76s)]
*  What was Hope Hicks doing on the stand if they weren't introducing evidence of what [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2417.2400000000002s)]
*  Trump was doing while president? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2420.6800000000003s)]
*  And she was talking about her time. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2422.34s)]
*  Anyway, that prosecution has to go, the conviction has to go because the conviction was based [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2424.0400000000004s)]
*  in large part on evidence the Supreme Court has said may not be admitted in any case. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2429.76s)]
*  That's just one thing. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2434.44s)]
*  But even the jail time, no one not named Donald Trump would get jail time for this. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2435.44s)]
*  And as soon as that judge tries to make this a jail time case, he will appeal it up to [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2440.64s)]
*  the First Appellate Division. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2445.12s)]
*  And I just don't think, maybe it'll stand there, but once it gets up to New York State [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2446.6s)]
*  Court of Appeals, those are still rational judges. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2450.44s)]
*  Those are the judges who threw out the Harvey Weinstein conviction. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2453.24s)]
*  They've got stones. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2456.3599999999997s)]
*  And they're not that afraid of politics. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2458.3199999999997s)]
*  They're not great. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2461.44s)]
*  It's not like our Supreme Court. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2462.44s)]
*  And I think Trump will prevail. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2464.14s)]
*  So I don't think he spends one day in jail. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2465.3199999999997s)]
*  And I certainly don't think there's a judge in the land who would put a sitting president [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2467.24s)]
*  or president-elect in jail. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2469.96s)]
*  Are there legal mechanisms that Mark Elias and the rest of the Democratic Lawyer Army [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2475.2s)]
*  can use to stop the electorate from certifying Trump president if he wins? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2482.52s)]
*  They're going to try. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2490.28s)]
*  I don't know exactly how they'll do it. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2491.76s)]
*  They may resurrect this. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2494.44s)]
*  He committed an insurrection. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2496.18s)]
*  I mean, they've said that they're going to. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2497.58s)]
*  He committed an insurrection, and therefore he can't be on the ballot. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2500.06s)]
*  That ultimately winds up with the U.S. Supreme Court, and they're going to kill it. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2503.18s)]
*  I mean, honestly, when you're feeling down about the state of our politics or our country, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2506.3399999999997s)]
*  this is what I do. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2511.98s)]
*  I go to bed at night, and I get under my blankie, and I think about the Supreme Court. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2512.98s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2517.62s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2522.06s)]
*  You have lawyer dreams. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2523.06s)]
*  I do. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2524.06s)]
*  I used to call Chief Justice John Roberts Chief Justice McDreamy until Obamacare. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2525.82s)]
*  He got downgraded. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2530.38s)]
*  I met him at an event one time. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2533.82s)]
*  It was a play in New York at some embassy. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2535.22s)]
*  I saw him. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2538.58s)]
*  It was one of those things where you're part of the play as an audience member. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2539.58s)]
*  You kind of stand there, and you're having dinner with the cast members, and they're [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2541.66s)]
*  acting. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2544.2999999999997s)]
*  It was actually very cool. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2545.2999999999997s)]
*  I saw him after it was over, and I went up to him, and I said, nice to meet you, Mr. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2546.2999999999997s)]
*  Chief Justice. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2549.66s)]
*  He said, nice to meet you, Megan. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2550.66s)]
*  I said, I'm a big fan. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2551.66s)]
*  I'm a big fan. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2553.5s)]
*  I said, oh, you're the one. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2554.94s)]
*  I said, oh, no, no. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2555.94s)]
*  I admire you. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2556.94s)]
*  But Obamacare was not a principled decision. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2557.94s)]
*  Doug was like, honey. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2560.94s)]
*  But it wasn't. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2563.94s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2566.94s)]
*  He laughed. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2567.94s)]
*  He's a good guy. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2568.94s)]
*  Look, he's got a different role in his mind on the court than the rest of the justices. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2569.94s)]
*  I agree with it in part, but I don't disagree. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2575.7s)]
*  I don't agree with the way he's been ruling. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2577.78s)]
*  Anyway, we've got Alito. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2579.62s)]
*  We've got Thomas, who seems great, in good health. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2581.74s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2584.74s)]
*  I had Gorsuch on the show the other day, and I love how anti-regulation he is. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2585.74s)]
*  Gorsuch is hardcore anti-regulation. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2590.74s)]
*  Just came out with a book talking about how big the administrative state has gotten. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2592.74s)]
*  I think he would like the Javier-Mele point. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2595.94s)]
*  He would like to cut all the federal agencies down by a lot. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2598.94s)]
*  So I like him, although he is responsible for Bostock, the one that said there's a [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2604.66s)]
*  mandate to put trans people in your workplace. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2609.54s)]
*  You can't exclude them based on the basis of being trans. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2612.1s)]
*  And that one's a little stickier. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2614.1s)]
*  Anyway, we've got a strong Supreme Court right now. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2616.1s)]
*  I've never seen a court like this in my lifetime, where it's 6-3, and it's going to take a lot [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2618.26s)]
*  to unearth it. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2622.94s)]
*  Now if they win control of the Senate and the White House, and they win control of the [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2625.1s)]
*  Senate by a lot, they could get rid of the filibuster. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2629.66s)]
*  Well, they don't have to. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2632.06s)]
*  They've already gotten rid of it for Supreme Court justices. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2634.26s)]
*  And they could expand the court, potentially. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2636.7799999999997s)]
*  And then we'd have to march in the streets endlessly. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2639.4599999999996s)]
*  That's civil war, banana republic shit that we'd have to fight. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2642.02s)]
*  Not calling for violence, but saying this would require every street in America to be [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2646.8999999999996s)]
*  filled with people. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2651.1s)]
*  But mass civil disobedience. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2652.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2653.1s)]
*  So that is a stated goal. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2654.1s)]
*  They've said that repeatedly, getting 16-year-olds to vote, having millions of illegal aliens [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2656.74s)]
*  vote and expanding the court. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2661.2999999999997s)]
*  They've all said that out loud. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2663.54s)]
*  Do you think they will try the last one? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2664.86s)]
*  Packing it. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2668.14s)]
*  To pack the court? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2669.14s)]
*  Depends on what November looks like. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2672.14s)]
*  If they win, how big is the victory? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2674.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2676.54s)]
*  You know, if it's razor-tight, I don't think they'd have the guts. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2677.54s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2682.82s)]
*  But if she goes in there thinking she has a mandate, it's a terrifying thought. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2683.82s)]
*  It could happen. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2690.42s)]
*  It could happen. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2692.2599999999998s)]
*  This is not Trump's locked up. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2693.42s)]
*  He doesn't have it locked up yet. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2696.5800000000004s)]
*  So people need to be really clear about what could be coming our way if she wins. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2698.7000000000003s)]
*  And get to the polls. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2705.98s)]
*  Get your friends to the polls. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2708.5400000000004s)]
*  Get a bus and get everyone you know in swing states to the polls. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2710.5s)]
*  And if she wins and thinks she has a mandate and starts doing the things she said she would [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2715.1000000000004s)]
*  do, go look at her ACLU questionnaire. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2719.78s)]
*  And at to his credit, Andrew Kozinski over at CNN Unearthed. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2722.38s)]
*  And see what she wants to do about defunding ICE and making the entire country a sanctuary [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2725.94s)]
*  city. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2731.98s)]
*  She said it. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2732.98s)]
*  Using your taxpayer dollars to fund sex change operations for prisoners and illegal immigrants. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2734.38s)]
*  The country will change dramatically and we'll have to use every tool in our arsenal to fight [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2741.82s)]
*  it and that would definitely include lawfare. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2747.42s)]
*  Challenges with the current Supreme Court to stop what they're going to try to do to it. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2750.94s)]
*  How would you assess her record in office as say attorney general in the state of California? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2754.94s)]
*  She refers to that a lot. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2762.3s)]
*  My read as a non-lawyer, non-legal expert is that she doesn't have limits in her behavior. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2763.5s)]
*  She seems totally happy to prosecute people she doesn't like because she doesn't like them. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2769.82s)]
*  She's your worst nightmare, Tucker. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2776.78s)]
*  She loves to go after the little guy, like the drug users, people with these small petty [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2779.98s)]
*  crimes and that's what she did, trying to convince people she was tough on crime as [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2786.46s)]
*  a San Francisco DA and then as California attorney general. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2791.74s)]
*  And then as soon as she got on the national board, she abandoned all that, started bailing [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2794.8999999999996s)]
*  out BLM rioters, started to go hardcore the other way backing people like Kim Foxx, the [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2799.8999999999996s)]
*  prosecutor in Chicago and so on, flipped all the way over the other way and is truly [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2807.5s)]
*  the daughter of a Marxist and has Marxist tendencies herself and is as far left as you [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2813.5s)]
*  can find. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2819.42s)]
*  I mean she's the most leftist presidential candidate we have ever had. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2819.9s)]
*  I think she's farther to the left than Bernie Sanders. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2825.58s)]
*  That's not what I read. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2827.5s)]
*  I read that she was the source of all joy. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2830.3s)]
*  Have you read that? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2835.58s)]
*  So I hear. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2837.82s)]
*  Although they've gotten rid of the joy since they had to kill the cackle. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2839.1s)]
*  The cat memes are my favorite. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2845.82s)]
*  It's still a creative country. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2847.26s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2848.54s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2849.02s)]
*  Have you seen the TikToks? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2849.7400000000002s)]
*  Then they're killing cats and they're killing dogs. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2852.14s)]
*  That's a new cat. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2856.38s)]
*  They're eating the pets. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2857.98s)]
*  That's really that. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2858.86s)]
*  That was the high point in American politics. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2859.5s)]
*  I mean that too. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2862.06s)]
*  So Kamala Harris as the, not to go over what we just saw like in the last two months, but [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2862.86s)]
*  how exactly did she become the Democratic nominee without anyone voting for her? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2873.98s)]
*  How can that happen? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2879.1800000000003s)]
*  I've never seen somebody so good at failing upward. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2880.38s)]
*  Right? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2884.38s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2884.7000000000003s)]
*  I know you're not allowed to talk about this but she slept her way into California politics. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2886.6200000000003s)]
*  It's true. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2893.02s)]
*  I don't say it to be mean. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2895.5s)]
*  I say it because it's true. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2896.54s)]
*  She slept with Willie Brown. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2899.02s)]
*  Which is its own skill. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2900.38s)]
*  I gotta say. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2901.5s)]
*  I mean maybe she just found him so he was still full of magnetism. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2902.1400000000003s)]
*  He was 30 years older than she was. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2905.26s)]
*  I said she had no talents. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2907.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean that was not fair. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2908.38s)]
*  And he paved her way. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2912.94s)]
*  He paved her way into California politics. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2915.1s)]
*  He helped her get elected as San Francisco DA. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2917.58s)]
*  And once you're in that system as a far left dem, you're good. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2920.38s)]
*  Of course you're going to become the senator from that state when the opportunity presents itself. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2923.42s)]
*  Never mind the identity politics aspect of it. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2927.42s)]
*  And before you knew it, Joe Biden was running around promising people he'd add a black woman [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2930.1400000000003s)]
*  to the ticket because James Clyburn said you're not going to win South Carolina unless you do that. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2933.82s)]
*  So he did it and now she's our vice president. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2937.98s)]
*  And then he falls apart after the big cover-up and next thing you know, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2940.1400000000003s)]
*  she's out there an empty vessel pretending she's the next Obama. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2945.02s)]
*  Do you guys know that there was a report by Mark Halperin [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2950.6200000000003s)]
*  who's very tied into these Democrat circles that before the Democratic National Convention speech, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2954.78s)]
*  she was prepped by CAA, Creative Artists Agency, the biggest Hollywood agency there is, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2960.38s)]
*  Brian Lord who runs it and top Hollywood talent on how to deliver her lines, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2966.6200000000003s)]
*  how to nail her speech. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2971.5800000000004s)]
*  Now what are the odds that she when she was hauled up for those five or six days preparing for the [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2973.34s)]
*  debate didn't have help like that? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2977.1s)]
*  That's what she's got. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2979.02s)]
*  If you're the Republican candidate, you show up, you've got both of the moderators and your [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2980.7799999999997s)]
*  opponent against you, you get interrupted in every answer, you get fact-checked erroneously [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2985.8199999999997s)]
*  in every answer, you get the moderator's opinion coming at you as a fact check, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2990.38s)]
*  you get follow-ups on everything. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2994.7s)]
*  If you try to dodge or weave it all, they will nail you to the floor. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2996.2999999999997s)]
*  But if you're Kamala Harris and you've said everything there is to say about fracking [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=2999.2599999999998s)]
*  and then show up and say I've always been consistent, it's thank you, Madam President. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3003.18s)]
*  The most interesting and newsworthy television show of the year is coming here to TCN. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3008.06s)]
*  We are not bragging, that's actually true. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3013.8199999999997s)]
*  So our longtime producer Justin Wells and a team have been embedded with no publicity at all [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3021.5s)]
*  with Donald Trump on the campaign trail for months. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3026.62s)]
*  They're the only crew capturing what is going on on the campaign in real time, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3029.58s)]
*  intimately. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3035.18s)]
*  They're with Trump as he campaigns for the presidency across the country and they've [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3036.14s)]
*  shot some amazing footage that shows you what it's really like in there. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3040.06s)]
*  So if you're a member, you will soon be able to get this docu-series covering the historic [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3043.34s)]
*  campaign, the fall of Joe Biden, never before seen footage from the assassination attempt [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3047.66s)]
*  at the Butler Township, Pennsylvania Trump rally and a lot more. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3051.98s)]
*  It's going to pull back the curtain completely. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3055.18s)]
*  They are embedded inside the campaign. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3057.02s)]
*  I can't wait to see it personally. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3059.58s)]
*  But to get it first, go to Tucker Carlson.com, become a member of the greatest television [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3061.42s)]
*  event of the year. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3066.7000000000003s)]
*  We're proud to offer it. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3068.1400000000003s)]
*  So you've got one candidate who shows up with the biggest, most powerful Hollywood agency [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3077.9s)]
*  prepping her with voice coaches and the other candidate shows up with two cans of diet coke. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3082.78s)]
*  That doesn't seem like a symmetrical contest. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3087.5s)]
*  And a burger. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3089.74s)]
*  No, it's totally unfair. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3091.58s)]
*  And to me, it's been so frustrating to watch people, Republicans, over the past 48 hours [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3092.7799999999997s)]
*  say, well, that's the way it is. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3097.58s)]
*  You have to do better. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3099.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, that's just how it is. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3100.2999999999997s)]
*  Everybody knows the media is biased. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3101.66s)]
*  This is not the right attitude. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3103.5s)]
*  What happened on that stage on Tuesday night was a complete dereliction of duty by those [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3105.4199999999996s)]
*  moderators. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3110.14s)]
*  They completely abandoned all journalistic integrity and principle. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3111.02s)]
*  And it's deadly serious. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3117.5s)]
*  We're talking about a presidential election here. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3118.94s)]
*  They actively inserted themselves to the point where you actually have to wonder whether [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3121.9s)]
*  they made a conscious decision at ABC. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3126.86s)]
*  This is the night we're going to do it. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3128.78s)]
*  We're just going to lift the dress up and show them everything. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3129.98s)]
*  That we're not journalists. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3133.7400000000002s)]
*  That we are partisan hacks. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3135.58s)]
*  You know, I always thought, judging by David Muir's abs, that he was a great journalist. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3138.06s)]
*  But who is David Muir anyway? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3142.86s)]
*  You know, he's managed to fly under the radar. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3147.18s)]
*  That's one way to put it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3150.94s)]
*  Because he lets his programmers, his producers, and his content selections speak for his bias. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3151.98s)]
*  Media Research Center did a study right before the debate. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3158.7799999999997s)]
*  It dropped showing that I think it was 92% of their coverage on Kamala was positive, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3160.94s)]
*  92 or 93. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3166.94s)]
*  97% of their coverage on Trump was negative. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3168.54s)]
*  And they said that ABC was the worst of the three nightly newscasts. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3171.18s)]
*  NBC more fair than ABC. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3175.18s)]
*  CBS as well. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3178.7s)]
*  So he got chosen to do the debate. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3180.14s)]
*  And when David Muir was out there without the producers selecting the stories, all of [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3183.3399999999997s)]
*  which were left, you're left to say, okay, let's see you, David Muir. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3187.66s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3190.7s)]
*  And of course, we already knew because he has a say on content selection on his show. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3191.74s)]
*  But he really let his freak flag fly. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3195.66s)]
*  And what they did up there, I mean, I'll just take the one moment, which is really driving [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3199.8199999999997s)]
*  me insane. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3204.46s)]
*  They asked Trump about his comment that he lost by a whisker recently on a podcast. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3206.14s)]
*  Fair question. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3211.18s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3211.7400000000002s)]
*  You can ask him that. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3212.06s)]
*  And Trump says while I was being sarcastic, he actually fact checked him with I didn't [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3213.18s)]
*  detect any sarcasm. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3219.18s)]
*  Are you like one of those emojis from the emoji movie that can detect that's not sarcasm? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3222.62s)]
*  No, that's a truth teller. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3227.5s)]
*  It was the most inappropriate thing I've ever seen. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3230.14s)]
*  And it masqueraded as a fact check. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3232.86s)]
*  And it of course, tripped Trump up. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3235.1800000000003s)]
*  And just give you one other thing. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3237.1800000000003s)]
*  It's another moment of the debate. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3238.7000000000003s)]
*  They asked Kamala Harris about the fact that they did nothing about immigration until the [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3240.7000000000003s)]
*  last six months, right? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3243.6600000000003s)]
*  Obviously an election ploy to make the numbers look better. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3244.7000000000003s)]
*  They turned to her. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3248.46s)]
*  First, she does her John Wayne routine like, well, I was tough on their border back when [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3249.26s)]
*  I was an AG. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3254.1400000000003s)]
*  And now again, sure, sure, Jan. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3255.02s)]
*  Well, she does have a gun, so I kind of get it. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3258.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3260.3s)]
*  She does. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3260.86s)]
*  Sure, she does. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3261.34s)]
*  So she gives that routine and then she immediately pivots to his rally stink and people leave. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3262.86s)]
*  And of course, for Trump, that's like, no, no, here's a liver snap. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3268.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3273.9s)]
*  And you're like, no, Trump, come back. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3275.42s)]
*  Come back. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3277.02s)]
*  No, don't do it. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3277.9s)]
*  So he did it. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3280.06s)]
*  He did it. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3281.42s)]
*  And then he did. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3282.54s)]
*  And you're like, pivot back to immigration. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3283.42s)]
*  This is your best issue. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3284.78s)]
*  This is her worst issue. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3285.98s)]
*  Pivot, pivot, pivot. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3286.94s)]
*  So he starts pivoting. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3287.98s)]
*  And that's what we got into the dogs and the cats. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3289.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3294.14s)]
*  I mean, they're eating the pets. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3295.34s)]
*  I mean, it is a thing, but maybe not our best example. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3297.74s)]
*  Like, you know, the Babylon Bee had a headline the other day saying like Democrats fact check [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3301.5s)]
*  Trump, no, no dogs and cats being killed, just women and children. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3304.94s)]
*  So he pivots back to immigration with the dogs and the cats. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3311.02s)]
*  Fact check. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3314.46s)]
*  Not happening. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3315.82s)]
*  Another inappropriate fact check. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3316.54s)]
*  This is a matter up for debate right now. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3318.86s)]
*  We've had dozens now at this point of witness testimonials saying it is true. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3321.1s)]
*  And we have one unnamed city manager saying, not that I could prove. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3325.74s)]
*  Well, that's not a proof that it's not happening. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3329.02s)]
*  Another inappropriate fact check. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3333.74s)]
*  So he screws up Trump's momentum. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3334.94s)]
*  And then he interrupts to go to Kamala Harris. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3337.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm thinking, okay, this is it where he's going to go back to her and say, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3339.66s)]
*  the question was, why did you wait until six months? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3341.98s)]
*  No one's given me an answer. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3345.9s)]
*  You know, we've done rallies and we've done dogs. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3347.26s)]
*  What's the answer? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3350.1400000000003s)]
*  And instead of saying that to her, what does he say? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3351.5800000000004s)]
*  Your response, Madam Harris, Madam Vice President. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3354.5400000000004s)]
*  What? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3357.5s)]
*  That's not the toss. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3358.2200000000003s)]
*  So what does she do? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3359.9s)]
*  Does she get up there and say, let me, let me give you an answer. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3360.78s)]
*  She says 200 Republicans have endorsed me. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3364.3s)]
*  And now we're off on that course and we never got back. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3369.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, to be fair, Dick Cheney was one of them. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3372.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3376.06s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3377.74s)]
*  Did you ever think you'd wake up in a country where Kamala Harris was bragging [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3378.38s)]
*  about Darth Vader's endorsement? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3383.18s)]
*  Like what? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3385.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3385.9s)]
*  And they love him now. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3386.86s)]
*  The left loves some Dick Cheney. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3388.06s)]
*  And his horrible daughter. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3391.66s)]
*  The whole thing is like, you're blowing my mind. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3393.18s)]
*  Of all the Republicans who could endorse. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3395.74s)]
*  I'll take Dick Cheney. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3399.18s)]
*  Just for the charm alone. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3400.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like what? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3403.02s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3404.22s)]
*  And by the way, the left, you listen to the leftist media and they really think [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3406.9399999999996s)]
*  that's going to make a difference. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3409.2599999999998s)]
*  Like they don't think that the Trump's going to recover from the Dick Cheney [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3410.7s)]
*  endorsement of Kamala or the Liz Cheney. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3413.74s)]
*  Lot of Liz Cheney Republicans left. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3417.2599999999998s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3420.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it is a kind of cleansing moment for the Republican Party. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3421.9799999999996s)]
*  Actually, it's like getting a giant bald splinter out after 40 years. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3425.2599999999998s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3429.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3431.1s)]
*  Here's what we'll do. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3431.4199999999996s)]
*  All the people in our party who love killing people for profit, you can have. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3432.62s)]
*  And she's like, that's right. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3437.18s)]
*  Enjoy. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3438.46s)]
*  We've got a big tent. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3439.2599999999998s)]
*  The water's fine. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3440.3s)]
*  But look at the Lincoln Project. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3441.18s)]
*  They're still out there doing these terrible ads about Trump after their pedophilia scandal. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3442.3s)]
*  What? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3447.1s)]
*  Now they survived that. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3448.7799999999997s)]
*  There was some guy there who was accused of behaving very inappropriately with young men. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3449.66s)]
*  I don't know exactly how young, but the point is there's still Democrats giving them [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3453.82s)]
*  millions of dollars and they're running ads against Trump like he's the bad one. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3458.62s)]
*  You get Bill Kristol and Dick Cheney. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3462.54s)]
*  What a trade. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3464.3s)]
*  So awesome. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3465.18s)]
*  We get Bobby Kennedy. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3465.74s)]
*  I think it's fair. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3466.7s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3467.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3468.62s)]
*  So just to end, you're the best. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3471.98s)]
*  I just want to thank you for this conversation. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3475.18s)]
*  It's just put me in a great mood and it's wonderful to see you. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3476.94s)]
*  But I want to just end on getting your views on a topic that I think is really hopeful [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3479.42s)]
*  and great. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3485.9s)]
*  So you have just painted a devastating portrait of the American news media and you're doing [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3486.22s)]
*  it from a place of deep knowledge and experience. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3492.38s)]
*  I mean, you're Megyn Kelly. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3494.7000000000003s)]
*  Like you're not making, you're not guessing about this. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3496.3s)]
*  You work there. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3498.62s)]
*  But then you leave NBC in the nastiest, most dishonest, as I said, exit I've ever seen. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3500.3s)]
*  Never seen anyone treated the way you were treated. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3506.3s)]
*  And then you built this kind of empire by yourself. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3509.26s)]
*  And it's an amazing story and it's a tribute to your grit and your talent, your native talent. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3513.02s)]
*  But it's also a commentary on like where we're going. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3520.86s)]
*  I mean, I'm not, I didn't even think to call anybody at NBC News to join on this tour [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3525.26s)]
*  because people don't even know who works there. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3530.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3533.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3533.7400000000002s)]
*  So maybe your life is a testament to what the future of media will be. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3534.0600000000004s)]
*  And maybe that's great. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3540.1400000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3541.9s)]
*  My life and yours, Tucker. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3543.1000000000004s)]
*  I think what we're proving is that the future of media is independent. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3545.42s)]
*  It's a direct relationship between the consumers and the journalist of choice. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3550.86s)]
*  People will make up their minds on an individual basis. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3556.78s)]
*  Who do I trust? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3559.6600000000003s)]
*  Who do I trust for news and information? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3561.1800000000003s)]
*  And who don't I trust? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3563.5800000000004s)]
*  And more and more, especially post pandemic, people are really realizing [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3564.86s)]
*  you can't trust these large corporations. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3569.34s)]
*  They have agendas that they are secretly and not so secretly trying to shove down your throat [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3571.5s)]
*  without owning it. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3577.1800000000003s)]
*  You have an individual. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3578.94s)]
*  You can make up your own mind. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3580.46s)]
*  Just is she a truth teller? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3581.66s)]
*  Is he a truth teller? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3583.18s)]
*  Do they take big risks and go against the grain even when it might hurt them? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3584.2200000000003s)]
*  Do they apologize to me when they got something wrong or own it? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3588.2200000000003s)]
*  Are they self-deprecating? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3591.1s)]
*  You're like the most successful slash self-deprecating person I know, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3592.2200000000003s)]
*  which shows your humility. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3595.82s)]
*  And you want someone with humility telling you about the news [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3597.18s)]
*  because sometimes we do get it wrong. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3599.9s)]
*  And we need to be able to say, all right, that one, not my best. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3601.66s)]
*  And the audience is forgiving. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3604.94s)]
*  But you don't want people who are agenda driven, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3606.86s)]
*  especially not with some corporate overlords agenda. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3609.1s)]
*  So it was funny. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3612.46s)]
*  I was listening to this podcast recently and you came up. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3614.22s)]
*  They're very angry at you. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3616.94s)]
*  And not the first time as a result, they were trying to say that you, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3618.86s)]
*  he has no influence, that he's very popular, but with no influence. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3623.74s)]
*  And this made me laugh. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3628.14s)]
*  Literally, you had the White House weighing in on Tucker's interview last week. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGRElF0Wss&t=3630.14s)]
