# Curt Mills: Trump Can Save America or Wage Another War, but He Can’t Do Both. Here’s Why.
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A)
*  So it's amazing to me that over 20 years after the Iraq War, its architects and supporters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=0.0s)]
*  are still not fully in control of America's foreign policy, but certainly influential [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=6.16s)]
*  in it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=9.78s)]
*  And it's shocking to me that two months after Trump's landslide victory, a race in which [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=10.78s)]
*  he ran against the neocons, the neocons are still brazen enough to try and influence and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=16.68s)]
*  sabotage his nominations. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=22.64s)]
*  We are days, but less than a week before Tulsi Gabbard's hearings. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=30.0s)]
*  Where are we in the below the radar war between permanent Washington's national security establishment, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=51.0s)]
*  and the incoming Trump administration? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=59.0s)]
*  I think it's unclear. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=61.0s)]
*  So as of this recording 10 minutes ago, Mr. Hegseth, the defense secretary was just confirmed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=62.2s)]
*  on a 50-50 vote. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Hegseth is an interesting character, I believe a former colleague of yours. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  He appears to have done a bit of a conversion on his foreign policy beliefs. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=73.0s)]
*  And the best evidence of that is the people that he's picked so far. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=80.28s)]
*  So his cadres, the people that will serve. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=83.72s)]
*  So this is relevant to people who know Pete Hegseth from clips on X of him from eight [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=86.36000000000001s)]
*  years ago saying things that would lead you to believe he's a pretty stout neocon. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=93.92s)]
*  But okay, so that's what you're referring to. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=99.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the available evidence is that he is like a, circa 10 years ago, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  was a pretty conventional Republican. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  And he has changed his life in more ways than one. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  So he is a question mark. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=113.12s)]
*  But the early evidence is the people that he has chosen to surround himself are stark [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=115.52s)]
*  departures from the man from 10 years ago. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=119.66s)]
*  And so that's a big deal. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=124.33999999999999s)]
*  And especially in a place like the Pentagon, which is hard to control. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  Yes, and wants no change under any circumstances except an annual increase in the number of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=130.1s)]
*  four-star generals. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=134.42s)]
*  It's the largest bureaucracy on earth. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=135.42s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=136.7s)]
*  And it exists to serve itself. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=137.7s)]
*  It's got a pretty abysmal record of winning wars, a pretty great record of spending money. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  He desperately needs reform. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=144.06s)]
*  And you're saying that based on the personnel choices you think he's making, he's now the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  defense secretary, by the way, as we're right now, that he is like sincerely on board with [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  Trump's foreign policy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he did not need to make these picks. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  I don't think he needed to make these picks to get confirmed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=160.98s)]
*  I don't think he needed these to win any senators. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=163.98s)]
*  He is courting, I think, minor controversy now, which is why we're having this meeting. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  He did not need to do this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=174.58s)]
*  It was a move of conviction and belief and principle in his early days in office. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=175.38s)]
*  Before even... [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=182.98s)]
*  So give us an example. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=183.98s)]
*  Just give us an example of what you're talking about. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=184.98s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=186.86s)]
*  There's going to be this Michael Domino figure who will have the Middle East portfolio. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=187.86s)]
*  He has been advised throughout the process by another figure named Daniel Caldwell. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=191.74s)]
*  These are both people in their 40s or 30s, basically millennials who are very, very, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=196.22s)]
*  very veterans of the global war on terror. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=203.7s)]
*  They're very much in the... [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=206.38s)]
*  So they fought in that? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=207.61999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Dan did. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=209.1s)]
*  And Michael was a CIA agent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=211.14s)]
*  So yeah, these are the guys that were hunting down IRGC, Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=213.1s)]
*  people in the forever wars that Trump and Vance ran on reforming and ending, et cetera, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=219.82s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=226.89999999999998s)]
*  They're very much in the Vance mold of we went there, not really sure what the point [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=228.9s)]
*  was and we want to roll back from that somewhat. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  I think you might have heard this message from Mr. Trump at least once or twice in the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  last 10 years. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  So these... [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=246.22s)]
*  I don't know, Domino, I know Caldwell, who I think of as a man of genuine integrity, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=247.22s)]
*  high intelligence and principle committed to his country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  I think he's proven that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=256.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=257.9s)]
*  I honestly think he's like a wonderful person. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=258.9s)]
*  But he's being attacked by people who never served with a long unbroken track record of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=262.38s)]
*  destroying America as somehow anti-American. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=267.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=270.62s)]
*  How does this work? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=271.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that the tactics are pretty clear. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=272.62s)]
*  So no one reads anything. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=275.46s)]
*  Everybody is cynical, confused. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  Nobody reads the magazine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=285.70000000000005s)]
*  Nobody reads anything. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=286.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=287.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=288.70000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=289.70000000000005s)]
*  Get a headline out there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=290.70000000000005s)]
*  Call someone a naughty word. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=291.70000000000005s)]
*  Say they're anti a country or they are radical. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=295.06s)]
*  If anyone sues this publication, it will take years and years and years and hope that some [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=303.18s)]
*  club member at Mar-a-Lago hands this to President Trump and tries to trick him and thinks that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=307.82000000000005s)]
*  Mr. Trump is a stupid man. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=314.02000000000004s)]
*  And this is the approach and this is what they were trying to do. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=316.62s)]
*  That's exactly. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=320.22s)]
*  It is a cyclone. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=321.22s)]
*  I mean, the word has been abused by the Democrats. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=322.22s)]
*  They've done this to me. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  But this is actual disinformation. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  I hate to use the word, but like... [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  One of the publications, who are the people involved in this campaign of lies? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=334.94s)]
*  I mean, I'm not familiar and I don't know any of the people over there personally, but [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=335.94s)]
*  The big story that's going around on both D'Amino and I believe Caldwell is from Jewish [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=339.7s)]
*  Insider. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=344.42s)]
*  And again, no one really wants to be attacked by something called Jewish Insider. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=345.42s)]
*  It doesn't sound very fun. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=353.58s)]
*  And so they are running headlines against people and they are attacking them. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  And what they do is they don't say anything that is per se inaccurate, but they totally [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=361.82s)]
*  strip the context for everything. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=369.22s)]
*  So what... [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=371.82000000000005s)]
*  Let's go one by one. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=372.82000000000005s)]
*  Do you know D'Amino? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=373.82000000000005s)]
*  Just by correspondence. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=376.58000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=377.58000000000004s)]
*  And what's yours? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=378.58000000000004s)]
*  Is this a radical figure, anti-American figure? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=379.94000000000005s)]
*  No. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=382.62s)]
*  This is somebody who wants to pull back, I would say moderately from the Middle East, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=383.62s)]
*  which I think at this point is basically bipartisan outside of the radicals within Washington, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=390.5s)]
*  DC and the Beltway. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=395.78000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=397.78000000000003s)]
*  So the people who want to continue what we're doing at unsustainable cost, being a bankrupt [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=399.34s)]
*  country by the way, sending aid to countries that are not bankrupt, those are the radicals. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=405.73999999999995s)]
*  I think it's fair to say. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=411.78s)]
*  So what are they saying about D'Amino in this hit piece? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=412.78s)]
*  They are trying to make the reader jump to the conclusion that he is anti-Israeli, that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=416.02s)]
*  he is pro-Iranian. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=421.34s)]
*  He's pro-Iranian. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=422.34s)]
*  Pro-Iranian. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=423.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=424.34s)]
*  He is somehow pro-radical Islam. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=425.34s)]
*  He's pro all the scary people in the world. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=428.62s)]
*  Radical Islam. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=430.22s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=431.22s)]
*  It doesn't really matter. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=432.22s)]
*  I don't know the guy. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=433.22s)]
*  He sounds kind of Catholic to me. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=434.22s)]
*  You know a lot of Shiites called D'Amino or is that a common name for Persians? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=436.22s)]
*  Not to my information. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=441.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=442.22s)]
*  And again, I think it bears repeating that this person was responsible for the tracking [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=443.22s)]
*  of Revolutionary Guard Corps members in Iran, potentially sent some of them to their death. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=447.74s)]
*  So the whole thing has an opera buffet flavor to it that he's being attacked as. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=453.7s)]
*  So what you're saying is these are people who will say anything. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=457.9s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=460.34s)]
*  They're kind of from the very white school of journalism. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=461.34s)]
*  Just like you have an objective, something you want to achieve and whatever it takes [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=463.41999999999996s)]
*  to get there is fine. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=468.9s)]
*  You will say it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=470.26s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=471.26s)]
*  You'll call anybody anything if it serves your purpose. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=472.26s)]
*  They are very, very willing to destroy this person with absolutely no compunction. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  Is there any evidence that he's quote anti-Israel? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=482.46s)]
*  None. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=484.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=485.5s)]
*  None. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=486.5s)]
*  So he's not saying that it's the contrary, which he praises the country. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=488.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=491.1s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=492.1s)]
*  He is critical of aspects of the war. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=493.1s)]
*  It's okay to be critical of other people's wars or your own wars. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=498.66s)]
*  It's okay to offer analysis of war. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=502.1s)]
*  Or to even state that it's not in fact our war as the President of the United States [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=504.34s)]
*  just did on his inauguration day emphasizing from behind the resolute desk that it's their [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=507.7s)]
*  war, not our war. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=512.26s)]
*  So I read something from a guy called David Wormser who was one of the architects of the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=513.82s)]
*  Iraq war. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=519.1s)]
*  Not from this country, not really concerned with this country at all. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=520.1s)]
*  And also I think it's fair to say, you know, someone who should hang his head in shame [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=524.58s)]
*  given a lifetime of destruction that he's helped bring to our country. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=528.1400000000001s)]
*  But describe these policies as anti-American. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=533.5s)]
*  So I have to say it takes a lot of balls for someone who has no interest in the United [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=536.5400000000001s)]
*  States to accuse someone whose whole orientation is helping the United States of being anti-American. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=541.98s)]
*  But I've noticed this a lot. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=548.02s)]
*  If you raise the question like, what are we getting out of this? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=549.9s)]
*  You know, the endless war cycle, we're getting bankruptcy, obviously. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=554.02s)]
*  But like, is this good for us? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=557.76s)]
*  They'll accuse you, you know, the Constantine Kizzen, also not an American, will accuse [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=559.34s)]
*  that wing, will accuse you of being somehow woke? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=564.14s)]
*  And you're like left wing for asking these questions. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  Have you noticed this? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=569.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting that you raise some of these figures. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=571.02s)]
*  We go into this all night. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=573.0600000000001s)]
*  I'd like to. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=574.54s)]
*  Yeah, they're hoping. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=575.54s)]
*  There's no more repulsive group in American life than the people who continue to push [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=576.54s)]
*  death and bankruptcy on the United States. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=582.82s)]
*  I think that's fair. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=585.94s)]
*  Can't recover from death. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=586.94s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=587.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=588.94s)]
*  So, I mean, I think that they're hoping that Americans don't do the reading. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=589.94s)]
*  They're hoping that Americans read X posts. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=599.02s)]
*  They're hoping that Americans watch random cable news hosts, that they're zoned out and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=601.5s)]
*  they hear they have, you know, let's say they have a positive view of, you know, certain [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=608.66s)]
*  aspects of America's role in the Middle East and they start tar and feathering people on [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=613.34s)]
*  the Internet and that there's no pushback on it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=619.5799999999999s)]
*  At the same time. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=622.3s)]
*  I guess the only reason I have noticed this is because it's so over the top. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=623.78s)]
*  Look, I think a lot of these positions are legitimate. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=630.5799999999999s)]
*  I disagree with them. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=633.54s)]
*  You know, a ton of these people are smart people. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=634.54s)]
*  I know almost all of them. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=637.2199999999999s)]
*  And they could make like a straightforward case for their position. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=639.2199999999999s)]
*  Like here's why we should affect regime change in Iran or here's why we should kill Putin. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=642.02s)]
*  I mean, maybe there's a case to be made for that, but they never make the case. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=645.74s)]
*  They attack anyone who stands in their way in the most brutal and dishonest ways. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=649.3s)]
*  They have no limits at all in their behavior at all. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=654.8199999999999s)]
*  And I just find that repugnant and like corrosive. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=658.18s)]
*  Even if I agreed with them, I'd be against that. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=661.18s)]
*  Like what is that? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=662.74s)]
*  It's guerrilla warfare. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=663.74s)]
*  They'll win at any cost. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=664.74s)]
*  Win at any cost. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=665.74s)]
*  I know I'm jumping in, but I'm just, I'm exercised. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=666.74s)]
*  I just watched what's happening to a man called Steve Witkoff. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=671.0999999999999s)]
*  Do you know Steve Witkoff? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=673.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=674.38s)]
*  So he's a friend of Trump's. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=675.38s)]
*  He's a real estate guy from New York. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=676.38s)]
*  I happen to know him just for other reasons. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=677.94s)]
*  How well do you know him? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=679.3800000000001s)]
*  Pretty well. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=680.3800000000001s)]
*  You know, just personally, I don't know a ton about his views. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=681.3800000000001s)]
*  I don't sense that, you know, we probably don't agree on foreign policy in some ways. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=685.62s)]
*  But he was tasked by Trump, as you know, to go over and affect some kind of ceasefire [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=691.98s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=695.5400000000001s)]
*  And he did. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=696.82s)]
*  And I doubt he's anti-Israel. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=698.7800000000001s)]
*  In fact, I know he's not, whatever that means. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=700.82s)]
*  he's being attacked is somehow an agent of the Islamic Republic of Qatar and like anti-Israel [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=704.62s)]
*  Steve Witkoff. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=712.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=713.54s)]
*  And I happen to really like Steve Witkoff. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=714.54s)]
*  I think he's just, I just like him. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=716.26s)]
*  He's just a great guy actually. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=717.8199999999999s)]
*  And he's really tough and he's just a good guy. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=718.8199999999999s)]
*  If you had dinner with him, you'd like him. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=721.4599999999999s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=722.62s)]
*  But I'm just blown away by the dishonesty rather than say, Hey, Steve Witkoff, like [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=723.62s)]
*  I disagree with you or whatever. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=727.0999999999999s)]
*  It's he's working for Qatar. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=729.38s)]
*  What? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=731.42s)]
*  He's from like Long Island. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=732.42s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=733.42s)]
*  This is the higher profile. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=736.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, like, I mean, they're hoping again that Trump has learned nothing. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=737.3399999999999s)]
*  They insult the president's intelligence. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=742.5799999999999s)]
*  But these people are disgusting. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=743.5799999999999s)]
*  They're liars. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=744.5799999999999s)]
*  And like, if there's one thing the country said too much of, it's lying. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=745.5799999999999s)]
*  Let's just stop lying. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=748.78s)]
*  Let's just be honest. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=749.78s)]
*  I agree. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=750.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=751.78s)]
*  I agree. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=752.78s)]
*  We've been corroded by lies. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=753.78s)]
*  Completely. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=754.78s)]
*  The country's about to collapse because of lies. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=755.78s)]
*  The people pushing endless war are one of the main vectors for that lying. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=757.74s)]
*  Like because there's just no reference point in reality at all. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=762.5s)]
*  If Steve Witkoff is an agent of the Islamic Republic, then I just give up. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=766.42s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=770.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=772.42s)]
*  No. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=773.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=774.42s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=775.42s)]
*  Lecture over. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=776.42s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=777.42s)]
*  I mean, the Witkoff thing in some ways is what set the whole thing off. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=778.42s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=779.42s)]
*  Witkoff? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=780.42s)]
*  He's like the most reasonable, moderate person in the world. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=781.42s)]
*  No, he's not anti-Israel. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=784.78s)]
*  I think the Witkoff thing surprised both sides though, I would note. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=787.22s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=790.66s)]
*  I think so obviously you knew him before. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=791.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=794.02s)]
*  Within recent years. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=795.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=796.02s)]
*  I think in general, the open source intelligence to use a lame term, but like I would say is [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=797.02s)]
*  that the hawks, people who want to say go all the way on Iran, did not expect Witkoff [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=803.34s)]
*  to be so pragmatic. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=809.7s)]
*  And then additionally, the realist and restraint camp also did not expect it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=812.42s)]
*  All the reporting from say Israeli media, say Haaretz or Sides of Israel, that Witkoff [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=816.8199999999999s)]
*  went in there and sort of with both the incoming Trump administration and the remnants of the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=822.54s)]
*  Biden administration, forced Prime Minister Netanyahu into some sort of deal, a deal that [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=829.5s)]
*  he had turned down six months ago in May of 2024, basically identical deal. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=834.9s)]
*  That threw most everybody in the loop for a loop. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=841.06s)]
*  And that has set off, as far as I can infer, a climate of hysteria within Israel itself, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=846.4599999999999s)]
*  at least among, I'm not sure Sir Netanyahu himself, but at least within the factions [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=854.6999999999999s)]
*  of his cabinet that are hardline as hell. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=859.9799999999999s)]
*  Okay, so they disagree. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=863.3s)]
*  You know, they've had to give a little, everyone does an negotiation. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=864.6199999999999s)]
*  It's not a disagreement. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=867.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, like this will not stop unless there's pushback. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=869.5799999999999s)]
*  All I'm saying is when you reach an agreement, everyone gets pinched. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=873.6999999999999s)]
*  That's just the nature of it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=878.6999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=879.9399999999999s)]
*  And no one likes it, you know, but like tough. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=880.66s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=883.9s)]
*  And my read on Witkoff is that he's just not super ideological. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=884.78s)]
*  I think he's pro-Israel. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=890.06s)]
*  You know, I wouldn't even question that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=891.18s)]
*  But I don't think he's an ideologue. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=892.6999999999999s)]
*  He's a self-made real estate guy who started with like a single apartment building in Washington Heights. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=895.26s)]
*  He's a tough human being. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=902.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think you need someone who's practical and tough to affect a negotiation. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=904.26s)]
*  You don't want someone who's captive to all kinds of theories. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=908.5s)]
*  Trump says, hey, Witkoff, get a peace deal or, you know, get a ceasefire, an intermediate peace deal, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=911.46s)]
*  a first step toward one. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=916.5400000000001s)]
*  And Witkoff's like, okay. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=917.86s)]
*  And he just shows up and he's like, hey, you, you. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=919.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=922.14s)]
*  I feel like that's, is that what you want? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=922.74s)]
*  I think a lot of Israel is surprised by this. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=925.46s)]
*  I mean, this was lost in the absolute cacophony of 2024. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=930.3000000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=935.6600000000001s)]
*  But yes, like if you read, I read the Israeli press daily. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=936.1400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, there were members of Netanyahu's coalition. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=942.0600000000001s)]
*  So these are members of the Prime Minister Netanyahu, people who are not in his party, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=947.1s)]
*  who are more hardline than him. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=951.18s)]
*  And they were saying, Trump's really talking about this endless war stuff. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=953.22s)]
*  This might be a problem. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=956.46s)]
*  And this was back in October and September and August. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=957.8199999999999s)]
*  And no one was paying attention because it was Brad Summer and, you know, other things were going on. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=960.5s)]
*  But this was coming. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=965.74s)]
*  And the fact that they got it done not even before, not even during the transition itself, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=967.46s)]
*  also surprised people. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=974.38s)]
*  And so. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=976.02s)]
*  I'm sensing inflated expectations here. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=977.78s)]
*  This is a foreign country, obviously an ally, a close ally, the closest ally, I think it's fair to say, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=980.46s)]
*  but a separate country. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=986.22s)]
*  And so, you know, I think realistic expectations would be we get some of what we want. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=987.5400000000001s)]
*  We don't get everything we want because, you know, we're not in charge of the United States. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=992.4200000000001s)]
*  But there's a tension here. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=995.46s)]
*  I mean, so first, the relationship between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel is extremely unclear. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=998.0600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1007.5s)]
*  I don't think maybe only the two of them know. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1008.54s)]
*  They have disagreed since at least 2020 over the election, but they probably disagreed beforehand over strikes in Iran. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1013.22s)]
*  The last time you and I spoke publicly was over the Soleimani strike in January of 2020. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1024.22s)]
*  And there were since then reporting in the last five years has come out that the two of them disagreed over that. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1029.98s)]
*  Trump felt that the Israelis didn't do their part, etc., etc., etc. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1035.54s)]
*  So for years, for at least half a decade, the well has been poisoned between Trump and Netanyahu. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1040.9s)]
*  Doesn't mean the relationship is done, but there's been an atmosphere of mistrust. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1045.98s)]
*  And well, he's had that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1051.22s)]
*  I've watched closely and, you know, interviewed him more than once. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1053.78s)]
*  And, you know, for Netanyahu. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1057.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1059.62s)]
*  Well, moving on 30 years because he's been in and out of office and he's had complicated relations. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1061.1s)]
*  With every president, you know. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1065.46s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think the key thing to understand for your listeners, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1067.22s)]
*  anyone who's not turning this off because we're getting into the depths of Israeli politics here. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1070.8600000000001s)]
*  But Netanyahu's situation is unstable. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1076.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1078.78s)]
*  A super majority of Israelis want him out. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1080.6200000000001s)]
*  They want him to resign. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1083.9s)]
*  He does not want to resign because if he resigns, he may go to prison. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1086.02s)]
*  And also, he's been a power achiever for 30 years. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1089.14s)]
*  And I've noticed that people who do that often don't like to quit. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1093.62s)]
*  I think that's fair. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1098.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. OK. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1099.1799999999998s)]
*  So he doesn't want to quit for both reasons of his freedom and, you know, the way of his life. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1099.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1105.86s)]
*  Yes. OK. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1106.22s)]
*  So... [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1107.1s)]
*  A pretty recognizable syndrome, I would say. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1107.46s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1109.1399999999999s)]
*  Not confined to BB. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1109.6999999999998s)]
*  It's international. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1110.86s)]
*  Yes, it is international. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1111.58s)]
*  OK. So how does he not quit? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1112.3799999999999s)]
*  It's pretty clear that spectacular circumstances justify his presence. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1116.6999999999998s)]
*  It's very similar, actually. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1122.78s)]
*  I mean, there's been comparisons between him and Churchill. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1124.06s)]
*  It's actually fair. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1127.26s)]
*  Only in wartime can someone like Netanyahu at this point get a position. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1128.98s)]
*  I get it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1132.5s)]
*  The war has to go on. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1132.86s)]
*  So what war? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1134.22s)]
*  So they have basically a deal with Hezbollah. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1135.34s)]
*  I think it's not like... [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1138.26s)]
*  I think that is by far the least likely that they're going to go back in there. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1140.18s)]
*  There are basically two options. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1143.3s)]
*  One, once all the hostages are exchanged, then they go back into Gaza. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1145.42s)]
*  OK? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1150.82s)]
*  Or, I guess one, B, is to do the West Bank, which is already going on right now. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1152.02s)]
*  Or two... [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1157.9s)]
*  What do you mean, do the West Bank? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1158.82s)]
*  Invade it and exit. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1160.98s)]
*  I mean, there's... [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1162.66s)]
*  What about the people who live there? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1163.3s)]
*  Like, what happens to them? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1164.38s)]
*  Not Israel's problem. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1165.82s)]
*  What do you do while you're in the West Bank? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1167.58s)]
*  I mean, what are you doing there? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1169.5s)]
*  What is the point of the operation, do you know? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1170.42s)]
*  To annex the territory and build developments. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1172.94s)]
*  I mean, this is... [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1175.22s)]
*  I mean, and, you know, the unstated thing is that they'll either export these people [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1176.58s)]
*  or eliminate them. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1180.86s)]
*  And so, it's pretty terrifying stuff. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1182.34s)]
*  It's not light stuff, but this is not a light interview. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1185.1799999999998s)]
*  And so, the problem is the US is the military underwriter of this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1188.1399999999999s)]
*  The Israelis probably can't do this without us selling them weapons. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1194.74s)]
*  And so, while Americans are tuned out and not thinking about this kind of thing, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1198.4199999999998s)]
*  our reputation overseas is one of arms dealer. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1202.78s)]
*  And over time, that affects your children, being able to travel abroad, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1207.34s)]
*  that affects America's reputation overseas. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1212.46s)]
*  It's dicey stuff. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1215.78s)]
*  Well, it caused 9-11, among other things, right? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1216.78s)]
*  So, yeah, it has effects for sure. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1219.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1220.8999999999999s)]
*  Option two is Iran, which is... [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1221.7s)]
*  I'll just quote them... [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1225.74s)]
*  I'll quote the hardline perspective itself. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1226.82s)]
*  It's the head of the snake in the conception of the Israeli hardline [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1229.6599999999999s)]
*  and also the neoconservative right in the United States. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1234.74s)]
*  And so, Israel also can't do Iran, in my view, and also in general assessments, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1237.8600000000001s)]
*  without the help of the United States. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1245.42s)]
*  It's usually joint US-Israeli airstrikes, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1247.02s)]
*  or even a solo invasion of Iran by the United States is the ultimate sort of fantasy. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1250.98s)]
*  I'm going to need more coffee to proceed because you're blowing my mind, Kurt Mills. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1257.6200000000001s)]
*  When we first did a deal with Black Rifle Coffee, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1262.3s)]
*  Evan, the CEO, sent us like a case of coffee beans. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1264.42s)]
*  And honestly, I have not had any coffee since then. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1267.8200000000002s)]
*  In the past eight months, it's not made by Black Rifle. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1271.74s)]
*  We are obsessed. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1274.3000000000002s)]
*  And it's not just coffee. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1276.2600000000002s)]
*  They've got high-performance energy drinks, tons of merch that's very cool. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1277.42s)]
*  It is the best. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1282.14s)]
*  And we can say that as daily obsessive users of the product. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1283.98s)]
*  Black Rifle Coffee is awesome. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1288.2600000000002s)]
*  And by the way, Black Rifle itself is awesome. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1289.9s)]
*  The company is filled with Special Forces veterans [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1291.9s)]

*  Just one quick digression about Steve Wittkopf. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1334.8999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1338.1799999999998s)]
*  I think it's really significant that he's not a professional foreign policy figure. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1339.98s)]
*  He hasn't spent a career at the State Department or, you know, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1344.4199999999998s)]
*  doing bilaterals for his career. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1348.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, he's just a smart, tough, competent person [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1352.9399999999998s)]
*  who was charged with a task by the president and he got it done. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1358.06s)]
*  And maybe we need more of that. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1361.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, there are certain parts of statecraft that, you know, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1364.58s)]
*  probably it's helpful to have experience in statecraft, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1367.1799999999998s)]
*  but some of it's just pretty straightforward. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1369.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1371.98s)]
*  They get a ceasefire. OK. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1372.78s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, I know. I mean, I think there has... [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1374.06s)]
*  Did anyone from the State Department have done what Steve Wittkopf did? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1376.1s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1378.6599999999999s)]
*  No, especially without the president's... [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1379.6599999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1382.1s)]
*  But even if Trump had called someone in and been like, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1383.9399999999998s)]
*  OK, Mr. Career Diplomat, can you effect a ceasefire? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1386.54s)]
*  He'd be like, well, it's very complicated. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1390.1s)]
*  Wittkopf's just like, hey, ceasefire, stop. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1393.62s)]
*  No, it's the same. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1395.82s)]
*  I mean, like, the international relations has been made into... [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1396.54s)]
*  They have to make it into like a pseudoscience. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1401.86s)]
*  Exactly. Smart. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1404.1799999999998s)]
*  Just like everything else. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1406.46s)]
*  Yeah, just like everything else. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1407.26s)]
*  There's like journalism or even education. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1407.94s)]
*  Like, you can't teach third grade without a master's degree. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1411.9s)]
*  Are you kidding? Yeah. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1414.74s)]
*  So it's just needlessly complex. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1415.66s)]
*  When the first requirement is, do you like third graders? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1416.8600000000001s)]
*  It's nothing to do with your master's degree. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1418.94s)]
*  The whole thing is absurd. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1420.46s)]
*  Yeah. And then, you know, it's the same thing with all of academia, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1422.02s)]
*  which is like people's theses are increasingly more baroque [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1424.46s)]
*  and like nobody actually knows large things like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1427.54s)]
*  or at least know it in a way that is applicable in power in real life. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1432.62s)]
*  And I mean, maybe things are changing now, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1439.1399999999999s)]
*  but like also a lot of the foreign policy establishment, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1442.54s)]
*  it's different now in the second term, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1445.22s)]
*  but wouldn't work with the first Trump term, wouldn't work with their team. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1446.78s)]
*  And I think that was a discredit of the country. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1449.62s)]
*  I think that did not serve the country. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1451.82s)]
*  Well, of course it didn't serve the country. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1455.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, we know the country hasn't been served because look at the country. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1457.26s)]
*  And so I think, you know, we can say of all players, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1460.66s)]
*  they didn't serve the country, that includes the media. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1464.1000000000001s)]
*  And there have been times when I didn't serve the country, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1465.78s)]
*  like when I advocated for the Iraq war. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1467.7s)]
*  I mean, we're all culpable to some extent, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1469.0600000000002s)]
*  but it's just remarkable to me that people are continuing it. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1471.02s)]
*  So now, instead of telling us that Saddam has weapons of mass destruction, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1474.38s)]
*  or that Osama bin Laden attacked us for our freedoms, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1479.5800000000002s)]
*  or whatever the lie of the day was, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1483.0600000000002s)]
*  the new idea is that Iran is quite the head of the snake. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1486.02s)]
*  How many Americans have been killed by Iranian proxies in the United States [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1489.42s)]
*  over the last 20 years, do you think? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1492.3000000000002s)]
*  How many Americans in the United States? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1494.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, have been killed by Iran-sponsored terrorism. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1495.6200000000001s)]
*  Zero. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1498.14s)]
*  Right around zero. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1498.98s)]
*  How many have died of fentanyl ODs, drugs whose precursors come from China? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1499.7s)]
*  Millions. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1504.5400000000002s)]
*  Well, more than a million. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1506.0600000000002s)]
*  More than a million, okay? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1507.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, to play the play... [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1511.0200000000002s)]
*  So like, what are you talking about, Barry Weiss? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1512.7s)]
*  The Iranians back proxies that killed US troops in the Iraq War. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1515.82s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1519.66s)]
*  But we shouldn't have done the Iraq War. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1520.82s)]
*  Well, Iran took over Iraq because we took out Saddam Hussein [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1523.7s)]
*  in a majority Shiite country. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1528.34s)]
*  I happened to be there for that, and even I, as a 33-year-old moron, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1529.78s)]
*  was like, wait a second, in just a basic interest in demographics, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1533.82s)]
*  like, isn't this going to go to Iran now? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1536.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1538.94s)]
*  Anyway, yes, right. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1540.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1542.46s)]
*  But I just find it amazing that there's been no public conversation [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1542.86s)]
*  about whether or not the United States should go to war with Iran. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1549.46s)]
*  There's been no case laid out. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1553.26s)]
*  At least in 2002, they had the decency to lie to us [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1554.6599999999999s)]
*  in a pretty complicated, sophisticated way [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1557.78s)]
*  about weapons of mass destruction. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1560.34s)]
*  Now it's just like, shut up. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1561.8999999999999s)]
*  You're anti-American if you ask questions. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1563.7s)]
*  And it feels like we're moving toward a conflict with Iran. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1566.06s)]
*  Is that a fair... [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1568.62s)]
*  I think we have been moving towards one. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1569.78s)]
*  And I think basically the biggest risk of a democratic administration [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1571.78s)]
*  is a war with Russia. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1578.98s)]
*  And the biggest risk of a Republican administration [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1580.66s)]
*  is a war with Iran. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1582.86s)]
*  So my rule is always, that's why it's more ethical to be a Republican, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1584.22s)]
*  because at least the Iranians don't have nukes yet. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1587.66s)]
*  So that's actually pretty close to my first principle, just outright. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1590.3799999999999s)]
*  We have simplified it, haven't you, Kurt? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1595.58s)]
*  But the Iran war would be still the worst [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1597.46s)]
*  and not something that we should pursue. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1602.3000000000002s)]
*  And look, foreign policy experts at this point [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1604.78s)]
*  will chime in on this conversation being like, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1607.3000000000002s)]
*  oh, well, that's just so unrealistic. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1609.94s)]
*  That's not actually what we want. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1612.0600000000002s)]
*  This is actually just a ridiculous externality. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1613.5s)]
*  But I think it is worth noting that we have done wars [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1615.46s)]
*  top-laying governments throughout the region over the last 25 years. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1619.66s)]
*  So number one, it's happened very recently. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1623.66s)]
*  Number two, it is kind of the explicit goal of the hardliners. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1626.1s)]
*  And the hardliners keep moving the overage window in their direction. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1630.1799999999998s)]
*  And so while this is perhaps not 100% certain, hardly, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1633.94s)]
*  there is a hard drive towards doing this. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1640.1s)]
*  And picking off Pentagon deputies and allowing leaders like Trump and Vance [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1643.26s)]
*  to be surrounded by hawks and no dissenting voices whatsoever [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1650.22s)]
*  is absolutely essential towards any road to war. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1655.86s)]
*  And I have to say, the amount of calculated deception on the right. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1660.62s)]
*  So all of a sudden, Barry Weiss, who's a leftist, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1665.2199999999998s)]
*  becomes a conservative because she's against traniism or something. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1667.26s)]
*  Every normal person is against that. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1673.54s)]
*  But it's pretty obvious that the whole purpose of her organization, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1676.2199999999998s)]
*  the Free Press, and her career in journalism [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1680.9799999999998s)]
*  is to kind of soften up the right for war with Iran and to attack anybody. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1685.22s)]
*  And she gets this whole constellation of people, Neil Ferguson [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1690.18s)]
*  and all these kind of people who had weight to the project, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1694.7s)]
*  but who really are all kind of paid to flack for war with Iran [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1697.9s)]
*  and attack anyone who's not with the program. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1702.14s)]
*  I felt the sting of this, so I didn't really understand how this worked. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1704.42s)]
*  But then someone with thoroughly moderate foreign policy views, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1706.9s)]
*  I don't only want war with anybody, I'm not against anybody. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1711.42s)]
*  And all of a sudden, you're like, wow, people are calling you anti-American. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1714.54s)]
*  Well, there's precedent for this. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1718.98s)]
*  So I don't know any of the people you described personally. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1720.1s)]
*  But I'm just saying, you said the problem with voting Republican [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1723.66s)]
*  is you're more likely to wind up with a war with Iran. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1727.62s)]
*  And I agree with you, I'd much rather have a war with Iran than a war with Russia. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1730.46s)]
*  But I kind of don't want either one. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1732.7s)]
*  And it's just interesting how the groundwork, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1735.34s)]
*  I just know because I've been in conservative media my whole life, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1738.5s)]
*  all of a sudden, all these new people and you're like, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1741.34s)]
*  Barry Weiss, are you really conservative? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1743.3s)]
*  Well, not at all. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1745.34s)]
*  Then what are you doing here? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1746.46s)]
*  Oh, you're trying to convince me that I'm not allowed to oppose a war with Iran, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1747.3799999999999s)]
*  or I'm going to be written out of the conservative movement or something. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1751.6599999999999s)]
*  OK, so a lot of people are comparing Trump to Reagan these days. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1754.98s)]
*  And I think it is an inaccurate comparison, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1758.62s)]
*  but there obviously are comparisons that are very different human beings, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1761.6599999999999s)]
*  basically my position. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1765.3799999999999s)]
*  So if you accept that Trump is the biggest cheese since Reagan [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1766.5s)]
*  on the Republican side, what happened in the Reagan years? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1770.3799999999999s)]
*  So the neoconservatives, that is people who came from the left and moved to the right, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1773.58s)]
*  were very, very savvy, effective and reasonable at domestic policy. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1780.34s)]
*  They were very, very good on the crime issues of the day. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1786.06s)]
*  And their periodicals gained currency because, hey, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1790.86s)]
*  actually we should clean up the streets of New York, etc. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1796.02s)]
*  And some of them were, I knew a lot of them, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1798.94s)]
*  and some of them were really smart, decent people too. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1801.42s)]
*  And by the way, some of their foreign policy viewers were not crazy at all. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1805.22s)]
*  They recognized the Soviet Union was evil. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1808.26s)]
*  Like the first generation of neocons, midge dector, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1810.54s)]
*  I mean, I kind of love midge dector. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1813.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1815.98s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1816.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't think that they were all nuts at all. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1817.26s)]
*  Yeah, but by the 90s and 2000s, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1819.02s)]
*  if you believed in some crime enforcement in New York, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1822.6200000000001s)]
*  you also had to believe towards the march towards regime change in Iraq. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1827.8999999999999s)]
*  And so again, they don't want to sound like... [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1831.54s)]
*  I'm skipping that part of the buffet line. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1835.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1837.1399999999999s)]
*  I will take the safe city and the thriving economy. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1838.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to leave out the forever war. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1841.26s)]
*  Is that OK? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1843.1s)]
*  But I think that is the essential pitch of this new generation of neoconservatism, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1843.6599999999999s)]
*  which, of course, does not call itself that. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1847.4199999999998s)]
*  But it is moderation on the social issues. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1849.86s)]
*  Let's turn down the volume. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1852.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1853.6999999999998s)]
*  And at the same time, over here in column space over here, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1854.34s)]
*  a little news item about what's going on in the Red Sea [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1858.34s)]
*  and why the US needs to care. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1861.58s)]
*  And it's a drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1863.54s)]
*  and it can go on for months and years and years and years. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1866.78s)]
*  And all of a sudden, we super care about the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1870.02s)]
*  We super care about Iran. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1873.86s)]
*  And we have to underwrite a war in Israel [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1877.26s)]
*  until every single member of Hamas is dead. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1882.62s)]
*  And it's just not clear that the US national interest is there, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1886.06s)]
*  to put it lightly. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1893.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1894.6999999999998s)]
*  And I guess what I object to is, I mean, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1895.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm never offended by people with different ideas. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1897.6999999999998s)]
*  I'm never offended by someone who makes a sincere case, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1902.02s)]
*  affirmative case or something that I disagree with. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1905.06s)]
*  OK. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1906.78s)]
*  By the way, maybe he's right. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1907.46s)]
*  And I'm wrong. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1908.58s)]
*  I've certainly been wrong a lot. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1909.1s)]
*  The part where I get enraged is the bad faith. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1911.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1915.22s)]
*  And so you ask questions like, well, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1916.0200000000002s)]
*  is this in our interest? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1917.7800000000002s)]
*  Well, you hate so and so. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1918.5s)]
*  I don't hate anybody. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1920.0200000000002s)]
*  And I certainly don't hate that country. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1921.18s)]
*  I like it a lot, actually. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1923.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1924.98s)]
*  But there's no room for it. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1926.5400000000002s)]
*  They're preventing discussion. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1928.2600000000002s)]
*  And a lot of these people have the gall [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1930.74s)]
*  to describe themselves as warriors for free speech. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1935.22s)]
*  And that's when, of course, free speech [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1938.66s)]
*  is the last thing they want. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1940.02s)]
*  And they've gone out of their way [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1941.5s)]
*  to prevent any kind of open conversation [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1942.8200000000002s)]
*  about the most important topics in our collective life. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1945.22s)]
*  So I'm just bothered by the lying. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1949.42s)]
*  There's too much lying, don't you think? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1951.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1954.18s)]
*  And by the way, I'll even go farther and say, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1955.02s)]
*  having worked for Bill Kristol for five and a half years. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1957.38s)]
*  Bill Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1960.18s)]
*  that was the absolute launching point [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1962.1000000000001s)]
*  magazine of the Iraq war. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1965.46s)]
*  For sure. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1966.7s)]
*  And I was there. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1967.3400000000001s)]
*  I started the very first day of the Weekly Standard, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1968.18s)]
*  August 1, 1995, 30 years ago. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1970.82s)]
*  And I thought Bill Kristol, I still [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1974.3s)]
*  would say, was a great boss. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1976.06s)]
*  Interesting, fun to talk to, funny as hell. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1977.94s)]
*  Obviously, I think he's taken a really dark turn. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1981.9s)]
*  And his life has been kind of a disaster. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1983.98s)]
*  And I feel bad for him. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1985.64s)]
*  But one thing I'll say about Bill Kristol circa 2000 [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1987.46s)]
*  is that he would make an actual case for his views. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1991.8600000000001s)]
*  He would say, we have to go in and take out [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1994.82s)]
*  for the following eight reasons. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1997.5s)]
*  And he would write. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1998.9s)]
*  And you would say this is in 95, 96, 97. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=1999.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I was there for all of that. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2001.94s)]
*  And I wasn't paying super close attention because I was dumb. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2003.3s)]
*  And I was focused on other things. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2006.22s)]
*  And I was like, oh, yeah, it's his foreign policy, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2007.72s)]
*  hobby horse. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2009.3s)]
*  He's into that stuff. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2009.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm not that into it. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2010.78s)]
*  I didn't understand the stakes. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2011.94s)]
*  I didn't really understand anything, actually. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2013.26s)]
*  I mean, I was like a kid. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2014.7s)]
*  But I always admired and still admire [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2015.7s)]
*  his willingness and that generation's willingness [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2019.22s)]
*  to make their case, to write some paper. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2021.26s)]
*  Here's what we're for. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2023.26s)]
*  That is gone. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2025.14s)]
*  And now it's just like, can we censor the people? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2026.66s)]
*  Can we call them names to the point [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2028.94s)]
*  where they get kicked off social media? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2030.44s)]
*  So there's no counter argument. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2032.02s)]
*  Well, even Kristol himself has stopped writing. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2035.02s)]
*  Well, he could never write. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2037.8200000000002s)]
*  Not a genius, I will say. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2040.5s)]
*  But an affable, amusing person in meetings. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2042.14s)]
*  I mean, probably the most successful political organizer [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2046.0600000000002s)]
*  of the last 30 years. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2049.02s)]
*  Yeah, and tireless. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2050.1s)]
*  And there are good things to be said about Bill Kristol, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2051.9s)]
*  obviously. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2055.02s)]
*  He's called me a Nazi like 100 times. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2055.86s)]
*  But that's kind of the point. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2057.38s)]
*  I'm not a Nazi. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2059.34s)]
*  I'm not for the Nazis. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2060.18s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2061.78s)]
*  I've got different views. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2063.18s)]
*  And that's the turn that I'm really bothered by [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2064.1s)]
*  is just the pure ad hominem attempts. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2067.66s)]
*  That's an attempt at censorship. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2072.14s)]
*  And Barry Weiss engages in that relentlessly [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2074.2599999999998s)]
*  behind the scenes using all kinds of proxies, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2078.38s)]
*  some of whom I know. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2081.44s)]
*  And I just want to say it out loud. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2082.98s)]
*  This is deception here. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2085.22s)]
*  Okay, so I hope people know that. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2087.14s)]
*  I think it makes it impossible for the new president [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2088.8199999999997s)]
*  to do what he's promised to do [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2092.18s)]
*  if he doesn't solve this conundrum. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2094.38s)]
*  Tell me what you mean. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2096.98s)]
*  So, I mean, if the president wants to send troops [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2097.8199999999997s)]
*  to the US border and the president wants to rebuild [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2100.1s)]
*  the American economy and the president wants to focus [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2105.3399999999997s)]
*  on China and the president wants the moral credibility [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2109.02s)]
*  to end the Russia-Ukraine war at some point, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2113.54s)]
*  expanding the war in the Middle East, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2117.94s)]
*  even with prolonged arms sales, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2123.14s)]
*  corrodes his political capital. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2126.42s)]
*  Who's going to pay for that? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2128.06s)]
*  The United States. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2129.46s)]
*  No, but I mean, we literally are operating in the red [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2130.66s)]
*  to the tune of trillions of dollars. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2134.66s)]
*  Like how, in what world can we afford that? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2136.22s)]
*  Well, it's a very complex topic. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2139.56s)]
*  We don't have any functioning community hospitals left. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2141.06s)]
*  We have the reserve currency and we can keep writing debt [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2144.74s)]
*  until it causes an inflation crisis, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2148.58s)]
*  which a lot of people thought would happen earlier [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2151.38s)]
*  and did not. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2153.14s)]
*  And even our inflation crisis in the 2020s [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2154.1s)]
*  was mild by global standards. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2156.46s)]
*  So accordingly, we've got plenty of room [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2158.18s)]
*  for the big enchilada, which is an Iran war. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2160.54s)]
*  Yeah, so this, it just feels like a big deal. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2166.14s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2169.14s)]
*  And it feels like it's worth, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2170.14s)]
*  I mean, certainly if you comment on this, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2171.78s)]
*  you do ask yourself, is it really worth it? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2174.9s)]
*  Do I want to get into this? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2177.26s)]
*  By the way, a lot of people I really like [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2178.46s)]
*  and I'm friends with, violently disagree. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2179.88s)]
*  So you run the risk, which I really don't want, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2183.68s)]
*  of rupturing friendships over it. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2186.68s)]
*  That's the last thing I want ever. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2188.5s)]
*  And you think, hi, maybe I should be quiet, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2190.78s)]
*  but it does seem like that's a huge step. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2193.34s)]
*  And at the very least, the public ought to understand [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2197.46s)]
*  that there are highly motivated people [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2201.06s)]
*  pushing us toward that. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2203.54s)]
*  Do you think that we will participate [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2205.42s)]
*  in a military action against Iran? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2207.62s)]
*  Well, the big question is right now, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2210.26s)]
*  so there's a new Iranian president. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2212.26s)]
*  So the previous Iranian president died [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2213.62s)]
*  along with his foreign minister [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2216.5s)]
*  in a helicopter accident over the summer. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2217.46s)]
*  Little mysterious. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2220.14s)]
*  Are you going to use air quotes around accident or? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2220.96s)]
*  I mean, a lot of things happened last year. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2223.42s)]
*  It's very possible. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2225.62s)]
*  I mean, I don't think. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2226.94s)]
*  Everyone got killed last year. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2228.7400000000002s)]
*  So many accidents. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2231.2200000000003s)]
*  The Iranians' helicopter equipment, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2232.66s)]
*  to my understanding, is old. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2236.42s)]
*  And it is a rough part of the world [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2237.7400000000002s)]
*  and it's possible that it's likely that it just went down. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2240.26s)]
*  And again, I would say. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2245.78s)]
*  I would not fly in a helicopter with Iranian officials. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2247.66s)]
*  I'm just telling you that. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2251.18s)]
*  And again, if you think it was Israel, the Israelis, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2252.5s)]
*  pretty much took credit [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2255.94s)]
*  or didn't deny all the other assassinations [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2258.06s)]
*  that occurred last year. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2260.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't, you know. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2261.5s)]
*  Including of Hamas leadership, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2262.32s)]
*  Just for the record, I try to suspend judgment [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2266.02s)]
*  because I know a lot about what countries do. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2268.46s)]
*  And I do think, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2272.1400000000003s)]
*  this is one thing I'll say in support of Israel, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2274.5s)]
*  I do think that it is, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2276.1400000000003s)]
*  you know, it isn't fair to just single out Israel [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2278.7000000000003s)]
*  and say they're doing naughty stuff. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2280.7000000000003s)]
*  Like lots of people are doing naughty stuff. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2282.6800000000003s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2284.2200000000003s)]
*  My only, you know, the only point [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2285.06s)]
*  where I would feel like I wanna say something [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2288.7799999999997s)]
*  is if the United States gets sucked into it. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2290.5s)]
*  It's like that now we're talking about our interests, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2292.5s)]
*  my country, where my family's from. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2295.38s)]
*  And I think it's fair to speak up then. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2297.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I guess maybe the 2025 zoom out, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2299.46s)]
*  you would say there was an election in Iran [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2303.1s)]
*  right afterwards. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2306.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2307.2s)]
*  A lot of people disagree with our perspective. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2309.5s)]
*  We'll disagree with this term. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2311.58s)]
*  But the more moderate candidate, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2312.66s)]
*  people think there are no moderates within the regime, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2315.3399999999997s)]
*  but the less hardcore candidate one, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2318.74s)]
*  this is the first time this has happened [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2321.62s)]
*  since Trump left the Iran deal. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2323.06s)]
*  And this person, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2326.14s)]
*  it is not clear how much power he has within the system. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2329.06s)]
*  The Supreme Leader is old. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2332.5s)]
*  It's not clear how old. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2334.3799999999997s)]
*  And there will be a succession crisis [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2337.18s)]
*  to succeed the Supreme Leader should he die. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2339.5s)]
*  So it is this weird situation [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2342.02s)]
*  where every time Iran is in a crisis, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2343.98s)]
*  and they're in a crisis right now. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2346.22s)]
*  They're in an electricity crisis by all reporting. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2347.06s)]
*  Again, don't know if we can trust all the reporting, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2349.46s)]
*  but they can't keep the lights on in Tehran fully. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2351.38s)]
*  And what will they do? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2355.1s)]
*  And so every time Iran is at a decision point, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2356.6s)]
*  there is a fracas between what I will call the moderates [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2359.74s)]
*  and the hardliners within their government. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2363.88s)]
*  The hardliners wanna go for the bomb. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2366.62s)]
*  They think we can't trust anybody. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2369.74s)]
*  We need to get the bomb. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2374.1s)]
*  They also recently signed a mutual defense pact, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2376.58s)]
*  just short of mutual defense pact, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2380.3799999999997s)]
*  but a security arrangement with the Russians. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2382.22s)]
*  So they seem to have a bunker mentality right now. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2385.14s)]
*  If US intelligence or Israeli intelligence [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2389.54s)]
*  or Western intelligence assesses [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2392.8199999999997s)]
*  that they are going for the bomb in a real way. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2394.9399999999996s)]
*  So they can either be true or false, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2399.54s)]
*  but if they assess it, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2401.02s)]
*  then there will be severe pressure [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2402.74s)]
*  on the new administration to do airstrikes [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2406.66s)]
*  on Iranian nuclear. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2409.7s)]
*  Look, I don't want Iran to get the bomb. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2411.02s)]
*  I don't want anyone to get the bomb. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2412.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm against the bomb. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2414.02s)]
*  But I was around when Pakistan got the bomb [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2416.06s)]
*  and Pakistan is a country [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2418.8199999999997s)]
*  with a lot of wonderful people in it. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2421.3799999999997s)]
*  Kind of a great country in a lot of ways. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2422.74s)]
*  Spent a fair amount of time there. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2424.8999999999996s)]
*  However, the government of Pakistan [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2426.34s)]
*  is arguably scarier than Iran. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2428.7400000000002s)]
*  You think? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2430.6600000000003s)]
*  Harvard, Osama bin Laden, et cetera. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2431.58s)]
*  ISI has been really a source of disorder [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2434.1000000000004s)]
*  in South Asia for a long time. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2437.54s)]
*  And they've exported nuclear technology, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2439.48s)]
*  including to North Korea. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2441.2200000000003s)]
*  So no one's ever said anything about that. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2442.46s)]
*  That's not a crisis [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2444.94s)]
*  that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has the bomb. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2445.78s)]
*  I don't really get it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2449.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, why was that not a crisis? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2451.38s)]
*  Why do we do nothing to stop that? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2453.42s)]
*  I guess it occurred basically [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2456.82s)]
*  when the US was still quasi pro Pakistan over India. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2458.7000000000003s)]
*  And it was- [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2463.3s)]
*  That was a bad bet, by the way. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2465.1s)]
*  It was a Nixonian bet, actually. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2466.46s)]
*  He really didn't like Indira Gandhi. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2467.7400000000002s)]
*  It was basically- [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2470.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, okay, well. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2471.06s)]
*  I think we can say longitudinally that was a bad bet. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2472.38s)]
*  He just didn't like one person [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2474.7000000000003s)]
*  and it didn't really matter. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2475.96s)]
*  That was like betting on Wang computers over Apple. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2477.06s)]
*  Like it just kind of didn't turn out. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2479.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2481.98s)]
*  I'm not holding a Wang in my cell. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2483.78s)]
*  But the point is- [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2487.5s)]
*  Might wanna cut that. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2489.86s)]
*  We're keeping the Wang in. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2492.86s)]
*  Look, all I'm saying is- [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2495.32s)]
*  My father sold Wang computers. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2496.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh, did he? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2498.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh, I'm so sorry. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2499.02s)]
*  I didn't mean to make it personal. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2499.86s)]
*  No, no, well, no, it's just, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2500.7000000000003s)]
*  at one point, the top salesman in the country [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2502.46s)]
*  were Wang computers. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2503.9s)]
*  Your father sold some Wangs. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2504.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2506.2200000000003s)]
*  Is this actually going? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2507.1800000000003s)]
*  Of course it's actually going out. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2508.02s)]
*  I'm kidding, yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2509.34s)]
*  Yes, yes, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2510.1800000000003s)]
*  RIP, Wang. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2511.38s)]
*  It was five years ago this month [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2512.66s)]
*  that people started to drop dead [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2514.5s)]
*  in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2516.06s)]
*  Five years since the beginning of COVID. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2518.4599999999996s)]
*  And yet, for some reason, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2520.7s)]
*  we still don't know answers to the most basic questions. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2521.9399999999996s)]
*  And one man knows those answers. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2525.18s)]
*  His name is Dr. Tony Fauci. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2527.06s)]
*  And now, a documentary filmmaker called Jenner First [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2528.58s)]
*  is out with a new film explaining exactly what happened. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2531.22s)]
*  The film is called Thank You, Dr. Fauci. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2535.14s)]
*  We'll see it exclusively here on TCN. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2537.2999999999997s)]
*  Look, all I'm saying is it's important [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2542.66s)]
*  to maybe dial back a little bit on the moral outrage [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2545.1s)]
*  and assess the world as it is, assess what you can do, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2549.06s)]
*  you know, create a hierarchy of priorities. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2552.4599999999996s)]
*  Like, we don't want other countries [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2554.54s)]
*  to get nuclear weapons. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2555.8599999999997s)]
*  I think that's, I'm with the neocons 100% on that. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2556.7s)]
*  But, you know, in a complicated world [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2560.22s)]
*  that we don't actually control, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2562.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2564.2599999999998s)]
*  What, you know, what can we do? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2565.1s)]
*  What are the limits of our power [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2566.8599999999997s)]
*  given a lot of other factors, like our domestics, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2568.74s)]
*  our economy, the needs of our people? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2570.98s)]
*  Like, you can't do everything. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2573.14s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2574.66s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, so I think Trump should complete [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2575.5s)]
*  the work of his first term, which is he revoked the JCPOA, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2578.02s)]
*  the Obama-Iran deal, and he should do a Trump-Iran deal. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2582.18s)]
*  Well, he's sending Wyckoff over to do that, apparently. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2586.26s)]
*  Yeah, so Wyckoff, the aforementioned, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2587.62s)]
*  not only did what he did with the Israelis, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2590.7000000000003s)]
*  he was promoted for it, per reporting. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2593.62s)]
*  It has not been confirmed to my understanding [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2596.7400000000002s)]
*  by the transition or the White House, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2598.46s)]
*  but per the FT, and I believe another outlet, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2601.6200000000003s)]
*  Wyckoff is getting, quote, the Iran file. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2603.1000000000004s)]
*  Within the Trump universe, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2605.42s)]
*  that's as much power as the president wants to give it. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2606.86s)]
*  But as of filming, his role is expanding. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2609.82s)]
*  And if Trump wants a lasting legacy of peace and prosperity, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2614.7000000000003s)]
*  there needs to be an accommodation [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2620.5s)]
*  with the de facto government of Iran. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2623.5800000000004s)]
*  So if, of course there does. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2626.38s)]
*  This is just, this is totally insane. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2628.46s)]
*  It's counter to our interests, I guess, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2631.38s)]
*  is what I would say. Yes. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2632.86s)]
*  If you were Trump and you say to Steve Wyckoff, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2634.26s)]
*  hey, Steve Wyckoff, go get a ceasefire in place, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2637.54s)]
*  and he comes back like 20 minutes later with a ceasefire, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2641.26s)]
*  wouldn't you say, okay? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2644.1800000000003s)]
*  We like that pace. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2646.1s)]
*  I like that pace. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2647.42s)]
*  Wouldn't you send him to Iran? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2648.7400000000002s)]
*  I would. Yes. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2649.86s)]
*  Yes, yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, I mean, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2651.42s)]
*  and this is actually something both Trump and Obama, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2654.7400000000002s)]
*  who apparently get along now, at least perfunctorily, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2657.94s)]
*  agreed on is that- [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2660.9s)]
*  Well, they both dislike Michelle, I think. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2661.7400000000002s)]
*  So they, remember Obama on the debate stage in 08, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2663.66s)]
*  and he was just howled down for this, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2669.2200000000003s)]
*  whatever you think of Barack Obama, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2671.26s)]
*  said we should meet with the Iranian leaders face to face. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2673.14s)]
*  And Trump did similar maneuvers in the first term. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2677.18s)]
*  Why wouldn't you? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2681.02s)]
*  Yeah, with Kim Jong-un, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2681.86s)]
*  And again- [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2683.7000000000003s)]
*  We sucking up to dictators. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2685.02s)]
*  Oh, shut up. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2686.5s)]
*  Was North Korea policy more stable from 2017 to 2021, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2687.78s)]
*  or 2021 to 2025? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2691.9s)]
*  I don't think after 25 years of this nonsense, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2693.7400000000002s)]
*  killing dictators and watching their countries [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2696.54s)]
*  become more chaotic and more dangerous [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2698.5s)]
*  to the United States and the world, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2700.54s)]
*  that we have any obligation to listen to people [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2702.26s)]
*  who chirp like that. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2704.9s)]
*  No. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2706.02s)]
*  Sucking up to dictators, shut up. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2706.86s)]
*  To link it all. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2708.02s)]
*  You don't know anything, actually. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2708.86s)]
*  Some of it, so we started this conversation with, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2710.26s)]
*  you know, sort of the campaign against the cadres [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2712.26s)]
*  that are now serving Secretary Hexeth. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2716.02s)]
*  The people that are leading it, as far as I can infer, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2718.78s)]
*  are oftentimes many of the people [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2721.34s)]
*  that were behind the original rock war. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2723.18s)]
*  And so- [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2725.78s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2726.62s)]
*  Yeah, so this may seem obvious. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2727.46s)]
*  Well, I'm 55, so this is driving me completely insane. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2728.78s)]
*  I thought after we discovered [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2731.42s)]
*  that the pretext of the war was a lie, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2734.34s)]
*  that those people would, I don't know, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2736.42s)]
*  don ashes in sackcloth and go, like, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2738.62s)]
*  sit on a pillar for 10 years. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2741.7s)]
*  I think a lot of Americans assume that they did. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2742.86s)]
*  So we do this for a living. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2744.9s)]
*  Oh, no, they didn't. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2745.7400000000002s)]
*  They went around the World Bank [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2746.58s)]
*  and they still run the State Department. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2747.7400000000002s)]
*  And Toria Nuland, who was an architect of the Iraq War, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2749.42s)]
*  was an architect of the Ukraine War. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2751.86s)]
*  Like, this just doesn't end. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2753.34s)]
*  But most Americans have real jobs and don't know this. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2755.1400000000003s)]
*  And so these people are disguised [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2759.1s)]
*  or shrouded from public view. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2761.9s)]
*  And they are still quite effective [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2763.6600000000003s)]
*  at driving home an agenda. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2766.7400000000002s)]
*  In fact, I would assume they will win absent pushback. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2768.46s)]
*  Oh, they'll definitely win absent pushback. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2773.02s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2774.94s)]
*  Yeah, so they are still. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2776.18s)]
*  That's why I wanted to interview you. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2777.62s)]
*  Yeah, they're still hegemonic. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2778.7s)]
*  And even if they're a minority government, so to speak. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2780.66s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm, because I've spent my life in the media, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2786.1s)]
*  I'm very kind of fixated on their enablers, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2790.02s)]
*  their agents in the American news media. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2795.02s)]
*  And one of them who's working, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2798.54s)]
*  has been working for years on their behalf, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2799.74s)]
*  on behalf of Permanent Washington, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2801.9s)]
*  the foreign policy establishment. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2802.98s)]
*  Every bad idea is Jennifer Griffin at Fox, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2804.2200000000003s)]
*  the Pentagon reporter, who is now basically texting, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2807.34s)]
*  do you mean, is that the? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2814.38s)]
*  Michael Domino. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2815.98s)]
*  Yeah, is running around on behalf of her sources [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2816.82s)]
*  at the Pentagon, doing their bidding, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2823.26s)]
*  trying to torpedo these guys, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2826.26s)]
*  because permanent staff doesn't want to be challenged [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2827.5s)]
*  on anything. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2832.02s)]
*  And okay, there's a role for that kind of behavior, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2833.74s)]
*  it's called lobbying, but it's a little crazy [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2837.42s)]
*  that like a supposed news reporter would be acting [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2840.06s)]
*  like that, I'm not guessing this is a fact, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2842.58s)]
*  she's doing that right now, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2844.18s)]
*  and has been doing that kind of thing [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2845.5s)]
*  for as long as I've been paying attention [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2847.1s)]
*  like a couple of decades. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2848.86s)]
*  How does that continue? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2850.42s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know her personally, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2851.58s)]
*  but what I will say is the role of most Pentagon reporters [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2852.62s)]
*  has always struck me since I've done this [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2856.86s)]
*  as extremely hierarchical. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2859.1400000000003s)]
*  I mean, it- [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2862.02s)]
*  What do you mean by hierarchical? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2862.86s)]
*  It almost felt like the reporters worked for the Pentagon. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2863.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, of course they- [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2865.9s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, in any place that I've worked [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2866.7400000000002s)]
*  that had a Pentagon correspondent, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2869.1800000000003s)]
*  and that was the only way you stayed in the room. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2871.54s)]
*  And- [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2875.06s)]
*  Isn't this a democracy? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2877.2200000000003s)]
*  Where we have civilian command of the armed forces, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2879.9s)]
*  and the entire federal government works [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2883.94s)]
*  for the population of the country, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2885.54s)]
*  its voters, its citizens, its constituents, shareholders, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2886.82s)]
*  no, there's no sense of that whatsoever in Washington at all. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2890.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2894.14s)]
*  It's like, what are you doing here? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2894.98s)]
*  I think it's fast moving. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2895.82s)]
*  I mean, you didn't see criticisms or skepticism [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2896.7s)]
*  of the military from the right until the very last few years, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2900.18s)]
*  including from the new president, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2904.34s)]
*  including from organs of conservative media. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2906.46s)]
*  I think it started with Mark Milley, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2909.54s)]
*  but also the sort of- [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2912.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, some of us were out of the four- [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2913.98s)]
*  I know, but in public opinion service- [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2915.5s)]
*  It was considered a fringe position. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2917.74s)]
*  It's not fringe. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2919.8999999999996s)]
*  You know, I just refer you back to the pivot point [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2922.18s)]
*  in American politics in my lifetime, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2924.66s)]
*  which was the 2016 debate in Greenville, South Carolina, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2926.2999999999997s)]
*  where Donald Trump, home of the highest percentage [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2929.8599999999997s)]
*  of military veterans of any state, famously, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2932.18s)]
*  and Donald Trump came out against the Iraq War, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2934.7799999999997s)]
*  and all the dumbos at the channel I work for in Washington, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2937.14s)]
*  like, oh, he's lost it now, he'll never get the nomination, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2940.5s)]
*  he's offended all the veterans. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2942.8199999999997s)]
*  And of course, all the guys whose lives were destroyed [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2944.06s)]
*  fighting these wars, not on behalf of the United States, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2946.38s)]
*  not to the benefit of the United States, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2949.58s)]
*  they were filled with many emotions, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2952.1s)]
*  frustration, shame, rage, sadness, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2954.58s)]
*  and they immediately knew what he was talking about, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2958.18s)]
*  and no one in DC knew what he was talking about. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2962.74s)]
*  I think he overperformed his polling. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2964.58s)]
*  So like, he was polling at a certain, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2965.62s)]
*  he was ahead, and the Bush family came in, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2968.06s)]
*  that's when it was the last stand for Mr. Jeb [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2971.22s)]
*  in February of 2016, and George W. Bush [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2974.62s)]
*  campaigned finally for Jeb, and it was like, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2977.5s)]
*  we gotta keep him in the race, we're gonna make our stand, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2979.8599999999997s)]
*  and he did the big fat mistake, that is Iraq, debate, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2982.46s)]
*  and I think Trump was up 10 or 15, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2987.46s)]
*  I think he won by over 20 in that debate, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2990.02s)]
*  don't quote me on that, but it was something like that. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2992.4199999999996s)]
*  He was- [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2995.58s)]
*  It was right before the primary, I was there. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2996.4199999999996s)]
*  It was over the polling, so like, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2997.2599999999998s)]
*  not only did he not go down, and still won, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=2998.58s)]
*  he went up, and then clearly triumphed. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3001.5s)]
*  That was the moment when I was just, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3003.66s)]
*  whatever his flaws, I was for Trump, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3005.7s)]
*  because here was a guy telling a real truth, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3007.9s)]
*  a hard truth that no one wanted him to tell, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3010.5s)]
*  and was rewarded for it, and I just felt like that was, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3013.14s)]
*  that's consistent with my principles and beliefs, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3017.2999999999997s)]
*  which is you ought to tell the truth, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3019.54s)]
*  and a healthy country rewards people who tell the truth, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3021.2999999999997s)]
*  not people who lie. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3023.88s)]
*  There's a cynical bet, though, I would say, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3025.38s)]
*  that, and it's a cynical bet on Trump, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3027.58s)]
*  and it's a cynical bet on Americans, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3031.7s)]
*  and it's a cynical bet on Republicans and independents, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3033.86s)]
*  which is, I'll just, let's use the actual language [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3037.14s)]
*  of center left or left-wing media, it's a cult, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3041.2599999999998s)]
*  and once the cult leader leaves, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3045.34s)]
*  we can just go back to 2005, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3048.34s)]
*  and implant the same old free trade, open borders. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3051.38s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3057.1800000000003s)]
*  Endless neoconservatism, and actually, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3058.02s)]
*  the people that are driving the opposition [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3060.78s)]
*  to these selections in the Pentagon [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3065.7000000000003s)]
*  agree with President Trump's critics [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3068.7000000000003s)]
*  in spirit and in practice. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3072.5s)]
*  You know, that's an interesting analysis, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3075.62s)]
*  I mean, it's like MSNBC-level dumb person analysis, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3078.7000000000003s)]
*  but it's also like a real analysis, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3081.94s)]
*  and there is a sense in which devotion to Trump [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3084.2200000000003s)]
*  has a religious quality to it, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3087.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's undeniable, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3088.0600000000004s)]
*  I was just in D.C. for the inauguration, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3088.9s)]
*  I can confirm that, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3089.82s)]
*  and there are a lot of reasons for that. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3092.5s)]
*  I think a lot of voters feel like Trump [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3094.6600000000003s)]
*  is the only person who cares about them, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3097.5s)]
*  he's their only option, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3099.5s)]
*  and so they're on board regardless [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3101.1800000000003s)]
*  because where else are they going? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3102.38s)]
*  And I think that's true, A, and B, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3103.7000000000003s)]
*  I think that's a reflection of how badly [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3106.5800000000004s)]
*  the leadership of the country has failed. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3108.5s)]
*  People will take anything other than that, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3111.6200000000003s)]
*  but I also think saying true things out loud [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3113.1400000000003s)]
*  changes history, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3116.98s)]
*  I think that's the lesson of history, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3117.9s)]
*  the only people who actually change history [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3119.22s)]
*  are not the ones who marshal the biggest armies, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3120.7s)]
*  but the ones who speak the truth out loud. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3122.14s)]
*  I think it's a holy act, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3124.58s)]
*  I think it's a transformative act, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3126.06s)]
*  and all of history is the story of that act, actually, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3128.06s)]
*  and sometimes it takes centuries [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3131.3399999999997s)]
*  for the consequences to unfold, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3134.22s)]
*  but they do, it's inevitable, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3136.3399999999997s)]
*  it changes everything once you, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3137.58s)]
*  that's why there's such a almost crazed attempt [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3138.94s)]
*  to shut down people from speaking, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3143.18s)]
*  why speaking? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3145.3s)]
*  They don't care about violence, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3146.1800000000003s)]
*  they care about talking, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3147.3s)]
*  because they understand correctly [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3148.5800000000004s)]
*  that that's what matters over time, right? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3150.2200000000003s)]
*  So once Trump has said all this stuff, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3152.0600000000004s)]
*  there's kind of no going back. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3154.6200000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3156.34s)]
*  Do you think, I mean, that's my view, I don't know. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3157.1800000000003s)]
*  No, I don't agree with the cynical bet, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3159.26s)]
*  I think it's a bad bet, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3160.9s)]
*  which is why the tactics are increasingly hysterical [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3162.34s)]
*  and marginal. Hysterical. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3165.3s)]
*  But we're robbed of like a real debate, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3167.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3169.6200000000003s)]
*  if you think it's so important to kill the leaders of Iran [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3171.1s)]
*  and get into a full-scale war with a real country, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3177.62s)]
*  which Iran is, which is part of a real coalition. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3179.62s)]
*  They won't say full-scale. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3181.9s)]
*  They'll say like- Any war. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3183.54s)]
*  They'll say that the Ayatollah has to go, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3184.82s)]
*  it's very important to use as scary words as possible. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3187.7000000000003s)]
*  Ayatollah, the Mullahs, the Islamic Republic, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3190.94s)]
*  emphasize, and again, basically the bin Laden, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3194.42s)]
*  who's dead, runs a country, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3199.7000000000003s)]
*  even though these are different ethnicity [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3201.26s)]
*  and a different religion, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3203.26s)]
*  and so it doesn't really matter, you're stupid, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3204.7000000000003s)]
*  and we need to do this again. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3206.9s)]
*  And like, they won't say an invasion, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3208.86s)]
*  but again, some of the people pushing this stuff [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3212.54s)]
*  didn't say an invasion in 1996. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3215.9s)]
*  They softened the ground for it. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3219.02s)]
*  But where's the debate on it? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3222.58s)]
*  I guess that's the point. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3223.42s)]
*  There wasn't a debate. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3224.26s)]
*  I mean, it's a little harder here too, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3225.2200000000003s)]
*  because on the question of Russia, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3227.06s)]
*  it's been surprisingly effective for them [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3230.02s)]
*  to just dismiss all criticism as sponsored by Putin. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3231.4599999999996s)]
*  Like, you don't think it's a good idea to prop up- [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3235.2599999999998s)]
*  Speed is very important here. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3238.2999999999997s)]
*  The Zelensky government, you're a Putin puppet or whatever. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3239.4599999999996s)]
*  You want someone to do something- [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3244.1s)]
*  Can you really call like a white American Christian guy [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3244.9399999999996s)]
*  a puppet of the Mullahs? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3247.8999999999996s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3249.54s)]
*  It's like, I don't think that works, right? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3250.9399999999996s)]
*  Does it? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3254.5s)]
*  I guess they're trying it with Steve Wichoff. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3256.18s)]
*  You're a tool of Qatar. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3258.3s)]
*  Oh, so you're referring to- [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3260.7400000000002s)]
*  The Shiites. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3262.02s)]
*  I just don't think as a rhetorical matter, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3262.86s)]
*  it's quite as easy- [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3265.2200000000003s)]
*  Should we address the actual allegation? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3266.0600000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3267.6600000000003s)]
*  So Wichoff, I believe took his real estate firm [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3268.5s)]
*  took some sort of investment from Qatar. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3270.46s)]
*  And so first of all, I would say [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3272.5800000000004s)]
*  throughout the Trump entourage, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3276.1800000000003s)]
*  a lot of them have worked with Gulf States. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3277.5800000000004s)]
*  And as far as I can tell, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3280.42s)]
*  the real estate business is rife [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3282.82s)]
*  with investments from Gulf States. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3285.9s)]
*  And then additionally, as far as I'm aware, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3288.42s)]
*  this is hardly that man's net worth. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3289.82s)]
*  Well, the domestic, I mean, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3291.26s)]
*  you can't buy an apartment in New York [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3292.2200000000003s)]
*  because there's so much Chinese money [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3293.58s)]
*  in the residential real estate market. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3294.94s)]
*  So like, okay, so the argument is what? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3296.5s)]
*  You're only allowed to invest in your own company's [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3299.82s)]
*  country's real estate? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3302.1s)]
*  Okay, let's start here. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3302.94s)]
*  Let's ban foreign investment in our real estate markets. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3304.3s)]
*  Oh no, that's anti-capitalist. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3306.54s)]
*  Just the whole thing doesn't make sense. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3309.2200000000003s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3311.6200000000003s)]
*  What? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3313.3s)]
*  With the Qatar argument specifically, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3315.3s)]
*  I think it's an unusual place. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3317.18s)]
*  It was supposed to be the eighth Emirate. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3319.1s)]
*  So it is separate from the UAE. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3320.74s)]
*  It is the most conservative of those Emirates, I would say, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3323.1s)]
*  at least in terms of the government. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3327.74s)]
*  They have a perspective. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3329.94s)]
*  They spend money on media. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3331.82s)]
*  They spend money on press junkets. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3333.3s)]
*  They have an influence operation, no question. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3335.78s)]
*  But the idea that the small jetting, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3338.82s)]
*  you know, LNG dependent, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3342.1800000000003s)]
*  you know, peninsula controls US foreign policy, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3347.42s)]
*  hook line and sinker, top to bottom. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3353.2200000000003s)]
*  If you think that, I don't think you're extremely curious. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3358.02s)]
*  It's worth having an honest, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3362.1800000000003s)]
*  I've never seen one, there never has been one, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3364.2200000000003s)]
*  but an honest conversation about foreign influence [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3366.02s)]
*  on American policy. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3368.38s)]
*  That's a totally legitimate topic. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3369.5s)]
*  And, you know, we've kind of done a lot of lying [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3372.4599999999996s)]
*  and pretending, for example, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3375.8599999999997s)]
*  that Russia has like undue influence over American [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3376.98s)]
*  foreign policy, it's absurd. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3379.54s)]
*  But why not have that conversation? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3381.8199999999997s)]
*  Are there foreign countries that exert influence [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3384.2599999999998s)]
*  on American policy whose interests supersede [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3386.54s)]
*  those of American citizens when, you know, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3389.7799999999997s)]
*  in the minds of policymakers? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3391.66s)]
*  And, you know, there may be some of those. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3392.66s)]
*  How would we rank Qatar, you know, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3396.06s)]
*  in terms of its influence? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3400.22s)]
*  Maybe not in the top three. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3401.74s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3403.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3404.58s)]
*  So just having lived in DC, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3405.4199999999996s)]
*  this whole conversation is like so infuriatingly false [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3407.8599999999997s)]
*  and just silly. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3412.4199999999996s)]
*  I mean, are they running intel operations against us? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3414.62s)]
*  There's a lot of Qatar surveillance in Washington. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3417.06s)]
*  A lot of Qatar agents running around the Willard Hotel. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3420.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3424.98s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3426.3399999999997s)]
*  Right, very well-disguised. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3427.18s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3430.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean, are our countries doing that? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3431.66s)]
*  Are they hacking the Pentagon's mainframes? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3433.5s)]
*  I don't think, oh, China's doing that. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3436.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3437.3399999999997s)]
*  Right, okay, so. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3438.18s)]
*  Yeah, but making the allegation, though, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3439.02s)]
*  is a kind of armor, though. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3441.06s)]
*  It makes you seem informed. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3443.1s)]
*  It makes you seem like sort of a spymaster. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3444.74s)]
*  You know, like, I know something you don't. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3448.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm more serious, quote unquote, than you. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3451.4199999999996s)]
*  Everyone traffics in that nonsense, yeah. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3453.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, let's not have a conversation. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3454.94s)]
*  And it's very anti-democratic, small d. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3457.46s)]
*  Of course. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3460.02s)]
*  It is not agreeing disagree. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3460.86s)]
*  It is not saying we have different values [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3463.86s)]
*  and shaking each other's hand and walking out of the room. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3465.34s)]
*  It is shutting down the spirit of the system. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3467.9s)]
*  So that's exactly the complaint that I have. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3471.06s)]
*  And that's the problem that I have with Barry Weiss. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3474.2200000000003s)]
*  It's the problem I have with Jen Griffin. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3477.5s)]
*  It's the problem I have with the Washington Post. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3479.46s)]
*  Just so much of the media coverage of foreign policy [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3482.14s)]
*  is based on insinuation. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3485.58s)]
*  And like the cruelest, sort of character destroying [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3488.7000000000003s)]
*  insinuations that you're not loyal to your own country. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3492.26s)]
*  And I'm sure that- [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3496.34s)]
*  They reach for the biggest sword. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3497.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh, they go, man, they go right for the face. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3498.5s)]
*  And I just think that that's beneath a great nation [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3500.6600000000003s)]
*  like ours. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3504.02s)]
*  I think it's beneath any decent person to behave. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3504.86s)]
*  Like, if you have evidence that someone's selling out [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3507.94s)]
*  of his country, tell me what it is. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3509.62s)]
*  But to start with that, to accuse Steve Wicoff [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3511.62s)]
*  of being a tool of cutter, it's like so over the top. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3514.22s)]
*  I just feel like it's important to call out [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3518.2999999999997s)]
*  to people doing it and say, you're disgusting. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3519.9s)]
*  We're not listening to you anymore. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3522.58s)]
*  You have no influence except that that you project [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3524.06s)]
*  through aggression and threats. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3526.7799999999997s)]
*  And like, we're not playing along anymore. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3528.58s)]
*  I think a lot of it is effective in Republican politics [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3532.2999999999997s)]
*  because, you know, so you were there for the inauguration [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3535.42s)]
*  I observed a week ago. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3539.06s)]
*  And I've always observed that is usually when I meet someone [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3541.66s)]
*  from a red state, like a deep red state, Oklahoma [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3548.22s)]
*  or Alabama, it's often the first time in Washington, DC. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3550.86s)]
*  It's very like a Roman province visiting Rome [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3553.62s)]
*  for the first time. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3557.02s)]
*  Totally. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3557.86s)]
*  I'm here from Gaul. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3558.7s)]
*  Show me around. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3559.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3560.58s)]
*  And versus I would say blue state America actually has a lot [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3561.42s)]
*  of the coasts have a lot more familiarity of DC [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3565.9s)]
*  back and forth, etc, etc. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3569.5800000000004s)]
*  So when they hear the argument going on in the Capitol [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3572.06s)]
*  there's actually a de facto trust there [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3576.1400000000003s)]
*  that might be not as much there on the democratic side. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3580.6200000000003s)]
*  There's actually more jaundice cynicism [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3583.34s)]
*  on the democratic side. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3586.38s)]
*  So it was less effective. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3587.2200000000003s)]
*  They assume that the, despite it all, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3588.26s)]
*  despite all of the failures that you've announced [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3591.3s)]
*  that you've reported on fairly tirelessly, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3593.34s)]
*  they assume that the people in DC know what they're doing. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3595.9s)]
*  And I'm not sure that's the greatest default assumption. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3599.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think the track record is pretty [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3603.3s)]
*  speaks conclusively. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3606.82s)]
*  I mean, look, respectfully to the president. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3608.46s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump, again, is the only US president [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3611.1000000000004s)]
*  who was not a general or a former statewide official [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3617.6200000000003s)]
*  or federal official to get the presidency. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3622.1800000000003s)]
*  And with all due respect to the new president, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3625.74s)]
*  healthy country doesn't elect something like that. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3628.8999999999996s)]
*  It had that level of outsider. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3631.1s)]
*  That level of outsider could only exist [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3633.54s)]
*  within a polity that was deeply sick. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3636.22s)]
*  And I think he knows that. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3638.66s)]
*  I think he recognizes that. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3641.3399999999997s)]
*  And the fact that the Capitol doesn't imbibe that lesson, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3643.02s)]
*  I think they're imbibing a little bit more, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3648.7799999999997s)]
*  but it's like, I mean, it's still bizarre. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3650.62s)]
*  10 years on, I mean, Trump, June 2015, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3653.9s)]
*  so June this year, 10 years of Trump, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3656.7000000000003s)]
*  longer than Obama at this point, the Trump era, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3659.3s)]
*  in spirit, in length, it's like, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3662.7000000000003s)]
*  well, maybe there's something wrong with this country, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3665.86s)]
*  but it's like a 5% recognition. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3668.1s)]
*  It's not a 95% recognition. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3669.6200000000003s)]
*  I think national, I mean, first of all, I agree completely. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3671.38s)]
*  And I wrote a piece at the very beginning [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3674.1400000000003s)]
*  of this whole saga almost 10 years ago. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3675.7000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is a shocking, vulgar, and right. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3677.06s)]
*  Yeah, he's winning because you failed. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3679.1800000000003s)]
*  Simple, obvious. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3681.78s)]
*  Anyway, I don't think DC gets it, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3684.2200000000003s)]
*  but I also think at this point, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3686.42s)]
*  Trump is the most powerful president, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3687.9s)]
*  certainly since Roosevelt. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3690.46s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3692.14s)]
*  And the potential for achieving his promises is really high. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3693.14s)]
*  America has greater problems in its head [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3698.82s)]
*  since the Great Depression, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3700.62s)]
*  maybe even bigger than it had then. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3701.46s)]
*  And we have a chance to address them, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3703.38s)]
*  probably not solve all of them, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3705.7s)]
*  but make some headway on things that could help Americans, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3706.78s)]
*  sealing the border, stopping the chaos, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3709.74s)]
*  just taking a breather so we can figure out [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3712.2999999999997s)]
*  how to fix the country. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3714.2599999999998s)]
*  And the only thing that could derail that [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3715.74s)]
*  is another foreign war. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3718.14s)]
*  We can't do it with this stuff. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3719.7s)]
*  It is an actual choice. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3720.8999999999996s)]
*  It's an actual choice. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3723.54s)]
*  We cannot do the border if we do the Middle East. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3724.3799999999997s)]
*  So you had what, 200,000 people, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3727.46s)]
*  you're dying of drug ODs and no one said anything about it, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3729.3799999999997s)]
*  and endless lectures about Ukraine. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3731.66s)]
*  And it's no disrespect to the Ukrainians, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3734.2999999999997s)]
*  who I really feel sorry for, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3736.4199999999996s)]
*  but that's so unbelievable that that happened. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3738.3s)]
*  It's like a bad dream. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3741.1800000000003s)]
*  And now we've woken up from the dream [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3742.78s)]
*  and we have this chance. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3744.54s)]
*  And I'm sorry, I just, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3746.46s)]
*  with respect to Barry Weiss and Jen Griffin, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3748.5800000000004s)]
*  you can't do that to us again. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3750.2200000000003s)]
*  It's just not gonna go without a fight this time. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3751.5800000000004s)]
*  We have to reorient toward our own interests. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3754.5s)]
*  That's no disrespect to any other country, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3757.6600000000003s)]
*  to our allies who we use well and will help to the extent [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3759.78s)]
*  we can, but the idea that we're responsible [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3762.6200000000003s)]
*  for all these other countries, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3764.26s)]
*  when we're dying here, no mass. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3765.82s)]
*  Is that a radical position? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3768.98s)]
*  That's my actual position in my heart. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3771.3s)]
*  That's my actual position. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3772.7400000000002s)]
*  I agree, but it's very upsetting, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3773.86s)]
*  not only to leaders of some foreign countries. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3777.34s)]
*  And this is not just the Middle East. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3780.98s)]
*  We didn't even talk about Russia, Ukraine, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3783.54s)]
*  but like, I mean, that perspective is obviously very, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3785.46s)]
*  very relevant for extricating the United States [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3788.34s)]
*  out of the Russia-Ukraine war. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3791.34s)]
*  And almost every European capital is unhappy with that. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3792.78s)]
*  And you can have a conversation with a nice Danish person [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3796.82s)]
*  and you might agree on immigration or trade or wine, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3801.38s)]
*  but you mentioned like, hey, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3805.94s)]
*  I'm not really sure the United States [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3807.78s)]
*  should be underwriting a quagmire in Ukraine. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3808.6200000000003s)]
*  And like the conversation shuts down. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3810.5800000000004s)]
*  It is stunning. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3811.82s)]
*  Well, they're hell bent on suicide. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3813.26s)]
*  The Western Europeans and not the Eastern Europeans [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3815.34s)]
*  or Central Europeans, but the Western Europeans [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3817.6600000000003s)]
*  are, you know, decided to kill themselves. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3819.2200000000003s)]
*  And it's almost like if someone's standing on a bridge [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3822.22s)]
*  or in a window of a skyscraper [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3824.4199999999996s)]
*  and you're trying to talk them back in, it's hard. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3826.06s)]
*  And who knows why that happens. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3828.1s)]
*  I think there's a supernatural element at work, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3830.4199999999996s)]
*  is my personal view, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3833.06s)]
*  but whatever you think the cause is, that's what it is. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3833.94s)]
*  You blow up Nord Stream, destroy the German economy, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3837.14s)]
*  and you're not allowed to say anything about it in Germany. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3839.66s)]
*  I don't know that we can help you at that point. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3842.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3846.2599999999998s)]
*  Like if you're that intent on self-harm, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3847.1s)]
*  that anxious to destroy your own civilization, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3849.46s)]
*  make it impossible for your children to live there, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3853.1s)]
*  then you're killing yourself. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3855.02s)]
*  You can't help someone who doesn't wanna help himself. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3856.1s)]
*  Like go ahead and jump then, kind of, that's how I feel. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3857.7s)]
*  But just from an American perspective, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3860.8199999999997s)]
*  like all of this has been bad for us. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3862.62s)]
*  There's no way to pretend otherwise, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3864.42s)]
*  except to launch into some airy moral lecture [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3866.62s)]
*  about dictatorships and Winston Churchill [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3871.06s)]
*  and Neville Chamberlainer, just shut up, okay? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3873.62s)]
*  The Churchill thing's really essential. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3876.98s)]
*  It's just played out. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3878.54s)]
*  It's played out. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3879.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's played out in... [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3880.22s)]
*  There's a gamble that some of this stuff [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3882.5800000000004s)]
*  isn't played out though. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3884.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's a gamble that... [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3885.3s)]
*  I think people have... [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3890.46s)]
*  This country has a generational problem, right? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3892.5800000000004s)]
*  Generations don't get along. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3895.1400000000003s)]
*  I think that's fair to say. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3897.6200000000003s)]
*  For good reason. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3898.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and I think there's just a bet [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3899.6200000000003s)]
*  that a lot of the voters that made the decisions [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3902.5800000000004s)]
*  in the 90s and 2000s are dumb [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3906.2200000000003s)]
*  and don't care about their kids' future, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3909.94s)]
*  and will vote for the exact same thing. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3911.82s)]
*  Clearly don't. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3914.14s)]
*  Yeah. Sorry. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3914.98s)]
*  And will exert pressure on the new administration [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3915.82s)]
*  to do the same thing. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3918.2200000000003s)]
*  And I think there's a bet that the president [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3919.58s)]
*  is a desperate, cynical man who will do whatever it takes [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3924.42s)]
*  when he's pressured. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3928.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think the early evidence is that it's untrue. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3930.26s)]
*  I mean, I don't... [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3932.9s)]
*  The evidence is that Trump is less cynical [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3936.26s)]
*  than even his supporters thought he was. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3938.46s)]
*  I think that's the truth. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3939.94s)]
*  I mean, there's... [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3941.86s)]
*  Do you wanna discuss the Pompeo-Brian Hook stuff? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3943.7s)]
*  I would. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3948.62s)]
*  I was just reading the Barry Weiss editorial [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3949.46s)]
*  about how pulling Pompeos... [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3951.82s)]
*  What did she say? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3953.82s)]
*  I didn't read it. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3954.66s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3955.66s)]
*  It's a betrayal of Trump's promises. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3957.1s)]
*  Mike Pompeo. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3960.1s)]
*  Is that what the Free Press argued? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3960.94s)]
*  Yeah, that you're not allowed... [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3962.9s)]
*  You are required to pay for Mike Pompeo's security detail. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3964.58s)]
*  And I will just say point blank, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3969.18s)]
*  as someone who has faced greater physical threats [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3971.22s)]
*  than Mike Pompeo, I can promise you that. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3973.58s)]
*  If I have security, I pay for it myself. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3977.22s)]
*  Why does Mike Pompeo, as a private citizen, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3979.1s)]
*  get to stick me with the bill for his security detail? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3981.18s)]
*  How does that work, Barry Weiss? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3984.02s)]
*  And the point is that Mike Pompeo is a faithful servant [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3985.66s)]
*  of the kind of ideas that she is here to push [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3989.3s)]
*  on the rest of us. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3993.3s)]
*  And therefore he will be defended at all costs. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3995.38s)]
*  But let's just be honest about what's going on. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3997.26s)]
*  Anyway, sorry. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3998.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, details roll off. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=3999.7400000000002s)]
*  The government doesn't usually advertise it. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4000.94s)]
*  Everyone's got a detail. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4003.3s)]
*  Fauci has a detail. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4004.5s)]
*  Because he's in my dog park in Washington, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4006.46s)]
*  I hear about it. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4007.94s)]
*  I think the interesting thing, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4009.18s)]
*  so it's very easy to just glaze over Trump fighting [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4010.78s)]
*  with officials, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4013.38s)]
*  You know, the sort of the example of this [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4015.86s)]
*  is Trump versus Bolton. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4018.02s)]
*  And we can talk about that and it's fun, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4019.14s)]
*  but it's kind of over, right? [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4020.58s)]
*  Bolton's not in the mix. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4021.98s)]
*  Or at least with Trump. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4024.02s)]
*  But he's still got bits of egg in his mustache [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4026.18s)]
*  and I don't have his cell anymore, so I can't tell him, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4028.58s)]
*  but he needs to fix that. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4030.98s)]
*  Yeah, so Pompeo and Hook. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4032.06s)]
*  I mean, look. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4037.4599999999996s)]
*  Tell us who they are. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4038.74s)]
*  Mike Pompeo. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4039.58s)]
*  Yeah, so Mike Pompeo was the former Secretary of State, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4040.4199999999996s)]
*  former CIA director, former Kansas congressman, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4042.3799999999997s)]
*  former West Point valedictorian. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4045.8599999999997s)]
*  Harvard graduate. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4048.4599999999996s)]
*  Harvard law graduate. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4049.2999999999997s)]
*  Ozentec user. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4050.4599999999996s)]
*  One can make. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4052.5s)]
*  Sorry, I'm just doing the whole CV here. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4053.34s)]
*  Okay, right, right. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4055.42s)]
*  Yeah, so, and he was. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4056.26s)]
*  I'm so bitchy, I'm so sorry that I said that. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4059.38s)]
*  It's beneath me, I shouldn't have said that. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4061.86s)]
*  The Bolton-Trump feud is old. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4063.98s)]
*  The disagreement with Pompeo is potentially quite new. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4066.22s)]
*  And so by all available information, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4070.1s)]
*  Pompeo was in the mix for Secretary of Defense, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4074.18s)]
*  most likely, in the days after the election. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4078.46s)]
*  So much so that his son, Donald Trump Jr, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4082.78s)]
*  intervened in a sort of online campaign [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4085.66s)]
*  and other allies within that milieu stopped both Pompeo [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4088.42s)]
*  and the former UN ambassador [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4094.62s)]
*  and South Carolinian governor, Nikki Haley, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4096.1s)]
*  from getting administration posts. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4098.3s)]
*  I had heard about that, yeah. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4100.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4101.54s)]
*  Pompeo. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4102.78s)]
*  Patriotic Americans rallied, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4104.7s)]
*  as they did in Boston in the 18th century, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4107.099999999999s)]
*  to act on behalf of their nation at some personal risk, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4110.58s)]
*  but they did it anyway. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4113.74s)]
*  Unsung heroes. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4115.78s)]
*  One of Pompeo's former deputies, Brian Hook, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4116.62s)]
*  who ran something called the Iran Study Group [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4119.46s)]
*  and had various other portfolios and titles [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4121.86s)]
*  at the State Department. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4124.42s)]
*  He's actually someone Pompeo inherited [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4125.26s)]
*  from Rex Tillerson, his predecessor. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4126.9s)]
*  He kept him on. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4128.78s)]
*  Brian Hook, at various points throughout the transition [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4130.62s)]
*  in the last 100 days, was reported to be running [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4135.42s)]
*  the State Department's transition at some point, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4138.94s)]
*  then was rumored, again, rumored, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4141.58s)]
*  if it's rumored, I don't post about it, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4144.94s)]
*  I don't tweet it out, I don't write about it, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4147.58s)]
*  but it was rumored to have been fired, very unclear. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4149.94s)]
*  Trump, in the days leading up to him taking the Oval Office, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4153.98s)]
*  both issued essentially an enormous denunciation, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4160.18s)]
*  a fatwa against Mr. Hook, extraordinary, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4167.66s)]
*  to say, not only like, is this guy not in the mix, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4170.78s)]
*  I hate him, and he said that. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4173.62s)]
*  So that occurred. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4176.58s)]
*  And then additionally, both Hook and Pompeo's security [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4178.66s)]
*  detail was removed in the last few days. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4184.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know that Brian Hook has served in government [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4188.5s)]
*  in four years, why would he have a security detail [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4190.42s)]
*  paid for by taxpayers? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4193.74s)]
*  Not an expert on who gets secret service details. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4195.18s)]
*  But can I just, I just wanna say- [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4198.3s)]
*  I can actually directly answer that. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4199.94s)]
*  So the key thing here is that there is an allegation, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4201.9s)]
*  a belief, many in the intelligence community believes this, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4207.26s)]
*  that there were serious, credible plans by the Iranians [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4210.98s)]
*  to assassinate members of the Trump high command, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4216.099999999999s)]
*  as it were. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4219.54s)]
*  So Trump, Hook, John Bolton, et cetera, et cetera, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4220.459999999999s)]
*  in revenge principally for the Soleimani assassination. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4225.66s)]
*  Because even creating a lot of terror attacks [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4228.419999999999s)]
*  in the United States, you've noticed. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4229.86s)]
*  Oh no, no, that was in Tifa. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4231.54s)]
*  And so that is the essential, that is the causes- [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4233.299999999999s)]
*  I'm just gonna have to scoff at all of this. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4237.86s)]
*  I've heard a lot of this. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4239.459999999999s)]
*  The causes belly for it. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4240.299999999999s)]
*  I hear this all the time. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4241.139999999999s)]
*  I think the key thing here is the critique on Trump [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4241.959999999999s)]
*  always was he fired Bolton, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4245.7s)]
*  but he didn't really understand why. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4247.62s)]
*  So he just, he soured on the guy, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4248.86s)]
*  but he didn't change any policy. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4250.9s)]
*  He didn't learn. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4254.099999999999s)]
*  This is the sort of pedantic way [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4255.099999999999s)]
*  of looking at the president. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4258.0199999999995s)]
*  But with the Hook and Pompeo removal [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4260.38s)]
*  from his inner circle, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4266.179999999999s)]
*  there is, I think, very credible evidence [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4268.42s)]
*  that Trump's personal grudges [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4271.42s)]
*  are now blending quite heavily with policy. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4274.5s)]
*  He doesn't trust the Iran-Hawk old guard. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4277.5s)]
*  A lot of the Iran-Hawk old guard think tanks struck out [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4280.9400000000005s)]
*  in getting transition officials [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4285.7s)]
*  and officials in this government. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4288.46s)]
*  And again, circled around this very unlikely Pentagon, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4289.9400000000005s)]
*  helmed by a guy who has changed his life, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4295.78s)]
*  it appears, in pretty severe ways over the last five years, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4298.26s)]
*  both ideologically and morally, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4302.36s)]
*  is this very new Pentagon that is now being targeted [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4303.32s)]
*  by all the usual suspects. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4311.08s)]
*  And it is the biggest story in American politics [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4313.2s)]
*  that people aren't talking about. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4317.36s)]
*  So if I could sum up what I think you're saying, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4318.719999999999s)]
*  it is that Donald Trump may have actually broken the grip [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4321.28s)]
*  of the neocons on Washington. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4324.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, you control the Pentagon. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4327.599999999999s)]
*  You control the military. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4328.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's the- [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4330.76s)]
*  It just seems like this is, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4331.96s)]
*  because there was always this question about Trump. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4333.96s)]
*  You get up and you give these speeches [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4336.360000000001s)]
*  where you say, we don't want more pointless wars, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4339.120000000001s)]
*  I believe, in peace, through strength. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4340.68s)]
*  Not a wuss, it's not Jimmy Carter, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4343.240000000001s)]
*  but you assert American power, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4344.68s)]
*  but you don't embroil a country in wars [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4347.4400000000005s)]
*  that you can't win for no reason. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4349.64s)]
*  It's a very moderate, sensible common sense, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4351.8s)]
*  I would say, view. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4355.56s)]
*  So you say those things, but then you hire John Bolton. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4356.96s)]
*  The question is why? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4360.92s)]
*  And Trump would say, I've heard him say, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4361.76s)]
*  well, I hired Bolton, I beg your pardon, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4364.320000000001s)]
*  I hired Bolton because he's a lunatic [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4366.160000000001s)]
*  and he's a warmonger freak. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4369.120000000001s)]
*  He's obviously watching war porn late at night, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4371.0s)]
*  and people can smell that on him. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4374.200000000001s)]
*  And so when he goes into a negotiation, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4376.0s)]
*  he scares the crap out of everybody. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4377.6s)]
*  And then I show up, he's the heavy- [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4379.120000000001s)]
*  Bad cop. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4382.280000000001s)]
*  He's the bad cop. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4383.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, I've heard Trump say that. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4385.280000000001s)]
*  And I didn't know if I believe that or not, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4386.400000000001s)]
*  but I'm starting to think that I should have just believed him [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4390.16s)]
*  because it sounds like Trump's actual instincts [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4393.04s)]
*  are what he says they are. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4396.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the Bolton firing itself is, again, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4397.8s)]
*  ancient history, but it's circled around an issue of policy. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4400.04s)]
*  Oh, I remember. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4403.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, Trump had invited the Taliban, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4404.28s)]
*  which was then the outlaw, not government of Afghanistan, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4406.92s)]
*  as it is today, to Camp David on 9-11. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4411.24s)]
*  I just love the sound of it. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4415.84s)]
*  So Trump invited the Taliban to Camp David. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4417.599999999999s)]
*  He literally did that. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4419.68s)]
*  I mean, I'm just reporting the facts here. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4420.4800000000005s)]
*  I love it. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4422.72s)]
*  It's a great sentence. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4423.56s)]
*  So Donald Trump invited the Taliban. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4425.4400000000005s)]
*  So tonight, who's coming for dinner tonight at Camp David? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4426.76s)]
*  I know the Taliban will be here. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4428.84s)]
*  Bolton was wiped out before this meeting never happened, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4430.64s)]
*  but it was the instigating incident [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4436.12s)]
*  for the final breakdown of their relationship. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4440.200000000001s)]
*  I do think it's important, Kurt, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4442.08s)]
*  to just recognize the inherent hilarity of a lot of, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4443.4400000000005s)]
*  you know, just it is, in addition to being grave [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4446.6s)]
*  historically significant, it's very funny. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4450.28s)]
*  It is quite, it is. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4451.719999999999s)]
*  Very funny, a lot of this stuff is very funny. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4452.5599999999995s)]
*  It is sort of funny, yeah, yeah. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4453.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty great. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4455.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4456.0s)]
*  So you're very restrained and business-like and precise [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4457.799999999999s)]
*  as a reporter should be, as an editor should be, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4461.96s)]
*  but the story that you're telling, I think, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4463.759999999999s)]
*  I don't want to put words in your mouth, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4465.679999999999s)]
*  is a story of like real change. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4466.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4470.5599999999995s)]
*  Finally, we actually appear to be getting [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4471.4s)]
*  to like a foreign policy that puts America [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4474.92s)]
*  close to the center of the action. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4477.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4480.0s)]
*  Is that what you're seeing? [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4480.84s)]
*  No, I mean, if he sees this through, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4482.08s)]
*  this is the biggest presidency. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4485.36s)]
*  Certainly since Reagan, you alluded to FDR, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4488.04s)]
*  I mean, it is moving the ship of state [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4490.5599999999995s)]
*  and people are gonna try to stop him from doing it. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4493.36s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4496.36s)]
*  But they're not gonna say that he's bad though. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4497.2s)]
*  They're gonna go after- [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4500.72s)]
*  No one will ever say it right. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4501.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4502.96s)]
*  Well, I just want to counter signal him by saying, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4504.32s)]
*  I think what you're saying is true, I think it's real, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4506.6s)]
*  and I've never admired Trump more. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4509.72s)]
*  I don't think I'm gonna ask you this from the Trump question, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4512.8s)]
*  but this is like, America really needs this. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4515.120000000001s)]
*  It's just super important and it's not radical at all. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4518.280000000001s)]
*  It's not attacking anyone or canceling our allyship [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4521.160000000001s)]
*  with any country at all. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4525.240000000001s)]
*  It's just readjusting expectations for what we can achieve. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4527.04s)]
*  The reason that I started covering war [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4531.64s)]
*  and foreign policy principally is that the reality is [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4533.76s)]
*  that US domestic policy is a morass. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4537.56s)]
*  It's impossible to get anything done. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4539.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4541.12s)]
*  Yeah, Obama tried to do a healthcare plan. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4541.96s)]
*  They did six years in, they couldn't even get [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4544.280000000001s)]
*  the website working. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4546.0s)]
*  You know, the country's hard to govern. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4547.2s)]
*  But externally, the president is imperial. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4549.04s)]
*  He's God, yeah. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4552.16s)]
*  Quite literally the most powerful person on earth. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4555.4800000000005s)]
*  And if you want to burnish a legacy real quick, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4557.88s)]
*  you do big things in foreign policy. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4562.4s)]
*  You do shocking things in foreign policy. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4564.2s)]
*  That's what all the Republican senators have figured out. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4565.04s)]
*  You do surprising things in foreign policy. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4567.2s)]
*  You're John McCain, like you're, you know, whatever. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4568.04s)]
*  You've got a lot of problems in your personal [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4570.88s)]
*  and public life, but you can bomb around Eastern Europe [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4573.36s)]
*  and get treated like an emperor [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4576.04s)]
*  and feel like you're doing something. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4578.16s)]
*  You're, you know, Jim Risch or Mike Rounds [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4579.599999999999s)]
*  or some like US Senator nobody's ever heard of, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4582.32s)]
*  even in his home state. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4584.92s)]
*  But when you travel to Romania to tour a NATO base, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4586.5599999999995s)]
*  people are like, oh, you know, Senator Risch is here. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4588.96s)]
*  It's like. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4592.12s)]
*  The foreign relations chair, yeah. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4593.360000000001s)]
*  So. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4595.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4595.92s)]
*  And so that's a big motivator for our lawmakers, isn't it? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4596.76s)]
*  For sure, for sure. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4603.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4604.96s)]
*  I mean. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4606.4400000000005s)]
*  You go to Idaho Falls and no one's like, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4607.280000000001s)]
*  oh, I can't believe you're here, but you know. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4609.08s)]
*  With Chairman Risch. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4611.52s)]
*  Yeah, Chairman Risch. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4612.56s)]
*  It's like such an absurd. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4614.88s)]
*  Anyway, excuse me. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4616.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4619.76s)]
*  So, and I interrupted you [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4620.84s)]
*  because I can't control myself. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4622.8s)]
*  Zero self-control. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4625.16s)]
*  And get on the topic of pizza or neocons [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4627.360000000001s)]
*  and I'm just out of control. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4629.360000000001s)]
*  Tell me your analysis of Trump canceling the security details [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4632.92s)]
*  for Brian Hook and Mike Pompeo. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4637.04s)]
*  Well, he seems to have the authentic view [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4639.96s)]
*  that these people can afford it. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4642.84s)]
*  Especially with Fauci and especially with Bolton. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4644.2s)]
*  He specifically flagged them. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4648.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4649.84s)]
*  And Pompeo, like who's now running around being like, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4650.84s)]
*  I'm actually a businessman. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4653.52s)]
*  He's on a board of a Ukrainian company as well. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4655.56s)]
*  Well, he's on, I think more than one board, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4659.72s)]
*  but he's certainly running around, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4661.4800000000005s)]
*  including with people I know saying, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4662.6s)]
*  I'm a really kind of a business guy. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4664.92s)]
*  Look, I mean, so the Pompeo's things, I mean, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4666.68s)]
*  is like supremely interesting because I, you know, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4668.08s)]
*  I think it's somebody who probably would have [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4673.32s)]
*  positioned himself to run in a major way had Trump lost. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4675.0s)]
*  I think it's somebody who's not gonna quit being president. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4678.88s)]
*  This is not an unintelligent man. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4681.2s)]
*  Pompeo is smart. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4683.92s)]
*  This is, yeah, this is a real fighter. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4685.12s)]
*  He's not dumb. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4685.96s)]
*  No, I agree. This is a real fighter. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4687.04s)]
*  And I don't wanna say he's part of the cynical bet crowd, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4689.0s)]
*  but he's making a bet that the Trump thing will pass [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4692.8s)]
*  and I will be able to steamroll people like Vance [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4695.76s)]
*  and even Rubio in the future because I'm more vicious. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4699.0s)]
*  And in the meantime, you know, maybe make some money, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4702.24s)]
*  influence the debate, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4708.0s)]
*  And he's very impressive if you don't know, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4710.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, I mean, I like, I mean, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4712.719999999999s)]
*  if you don't come in with huge foreign policy convictions [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4714.32s)]
*  as I think you and I do, he can be very persuasive. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4716.92s)]
*  Just for the record, I had no foreign policy convictions. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4720.719999999999s)]
*  I don't think I'm ideological on the question at all. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4724.0s)]
*  I just think in general, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4726.4s)]
*  our foreign policy should serve the nation. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4727.96s)]
*  I am, I mean, I mean, like, I mean, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4729.8s)]
*  so I think this was very interesting about [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4732.28s)]
*  some of these Pentagon picks, not to keep linking it back, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4734.12s)]
*  but also the vice president. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4736.76s)]
*  A lot of these people, my generation, the millennials, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4738.72s)]
*  fought in these wars. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4741.14s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4742.280000000001s)]
*  And although the baby boomers forget it, we're now old, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4743.120000000001s)]
*  you know, and we grew up and we're quite mad about it. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4746.6s)]
*  And it's a bipartisan thing. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4750.400000000001s)]
*  It's not just like a Democrat, you know, anti-Iraq war, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4753.0s)]
*  indie music thing. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4756.6s)]
*  It's like young Republican people hate it too. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4757.88s)]
*  Oh, I, I don't know. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4761.4400000000005s)]
*  And they might hate it more actually, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4762.280000000001s)]
*  which is actually the interesting thing. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4764.76s)]
*  The, and the Republican party, frankly, might under Trump, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4767.360000000001s)]
*  might be a vessel of anti-war sentiment [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4771.6s)]
*  far more effectively than the Democrats. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4774.2s)]
*  I mean, I didn't see a lot of protests for the Ukraine war. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4775.84s)]
*  The Israel stuff was pretty interesting. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4780.280000000001s)]
*  That was probably was number one threat to Biden [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4782.2s)]
*  circa April, remember that? [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4784.6s)]
*  For sure. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4785.72s)]
*  But, you know, if you look at the conversation online, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4787.16s)]
*  if you look at the sentiments of young conservatives, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4789.72s)]
*  young Republicans, the anti-war stuff is big [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4792.62s)]
*  and it is not going anywhere. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4796.0599999999995s)]
*  And I think that also drives a sense of a timetable, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4797.7s)]
*  which is, you know, we've got these older people [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4800.62s)]
*  in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4803.42s)]
*  They have a certain belief set. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4805.46s)]
*  They're the people that voted for the stuff [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4806.94s)]
*  in the 90s and 2000s. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4808.82s)]
*  And we get this, get this stuff done now [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4810.0599999999995s)]
*  before the United States turns, you know, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4812.54s)]
*  on both parties on this stuff. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4815.9s)]
*  And this was always, this was- [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4817.74s)]
*  So we can't afford it anymore. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4818.94s)]
*  And our allies pivot to China [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4820.58s)]
*  and sell even more defense technology to China. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4822.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4826.34s)]
*  I do think they're, okay, so with a backbone of support [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4827.18s)]
*  for these wars has been evangelicals. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4830.74s)]
*  Let's just be blunt about it. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4832.54s)]
*  It's everyone, you know, beats up on the neocons [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4833.94s)]
*  or whatever these fervent intellectuals in Washington, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4835.94s)]
*  but really the foot soldiers of this have been [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4838.42s)]
*  Fox News viewers who are not ideological. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4840.34s)]
*  They're not intellectuals. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4844.26s)]
*  They're not, they're just normal American patriotic, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4845.3s)]
*  heavily evangelical people. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4848.9s)]
*  And the truth is, I think a lot of them [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4851.0199999999995s)]
*  are beginning to recognize that their religion [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4853.7s)]
*  does not support this at all. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4855.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4857.46s)]
*  I mean, it's really clear. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4858.299999999999s)]
*  Genesis six, why do we have the flood? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4859.86s)]
*  Why does God kill everything on earth? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4862.0199999999995s)]
*  All the people except Noah and his family, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4864.259999999999s)]
*  all the animals, except the ones in the ark. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4866.0599999999995s)]
*  Why does he do that? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4867.7s)]
*  Who spells it right out? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4868.86s)]
*  Because they're committing violence, that's why. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4870.259999999999s)]
*  So it's like the idea that, I mean, the Iraq war breaks out [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4872.86s)]
*  and all these preachers are like, no, no, no, really? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4876.0599999999995s)]
*  We have to fight Islam and kill all these people [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4878.02s)]
*  and that's what God wants. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4880.42s)]
*  That's not what it says at all. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4881.9400000000005s)]
*  And there's no mention of any specific secular government [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4884.9400000000005s)]
*  in the New Testament, sorry guys. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4887.9800000000005s)]
*  And I think a lot of Christians [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4890.06s)]
*  are beginning to realize this. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4891.3s)]
*  It doesn't, because you're a Christian, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4892.580000000001s)]
*  doesn't mean you have a specific political agenda at all, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4893.780000000001s)]
*  I don't think. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4896.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4897.700000000001s)]
*  But if your political agenda is like violence, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4898.540000000001s)]
*  that's prohibited, sorry. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4901.46s)]
*  And I, it's just, it could not be clear. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4904.580000000001s)]
*  It's on every freaking page. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4906.78s)]
*  So I don't know the deception involved in this [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4908.58s)]
*  was just like mind boggling that these preachers [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4910.5s)]
*  could get up on Fox News and tell you that like, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4912.38s)]
*  yeah, killing people is what Jesus wants. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4914.58s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4916.58s)]
*  And I just feel among people I know, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4918.46s)]
*  a growing recognition of that. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4921.26s)]
*  And I think it's a huge problem for the war lobby, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4922.7s)]
*  which has used these people as its supporters. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4925.0199999999995s)]
*  And you see it in the Congress, you know, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4927.98s)]
*  I'm an evangelical and I'm for another war with somebody. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4929.86s)]
*  No, you can't do that anymore. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4933.9s)]
*  They're hoping people are zoned out. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4935.14s)]
*  You do think that? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4936.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're hoping the country's old, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4938.42s)]
*  tired, zoned out, can't oppose it. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4940.46s)]
*  And they're hoping that these initiatives [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4942.9400000000005s)]
*  can be achieved piecemeal, you know, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4945.9400000000005s)]
*  start by bombing Iran here, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4949.34s)]
*  Maybe the government will collapse, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4952.740000000001s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4954.5s)]
*  To be replaced by what? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4955.860000000001s)]
*  The same people who replaced Assad and Gaddafi [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4958.660000000001s)]
*  and Saddam and the Taliban. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4961.18s)]
*  I think, okay, I mean, to take the other side, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4962.86s)]
*  I mean, the Assad thing is, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4965.42s)]
*  that's like pretty close to the best case scenario [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4968.259999999999s)]
*  of how that could have gone. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4970.46s)]
*  I think in Iran, it would go way, way, way worse. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4971.299999999999s)]
*  It's a much bigger country. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4975.78s)]
*  It's hard to know, you're rolling the dice. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4977.78s)]
*  You know, you start killing people [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4979.219999999999s)]
*  and things go sideways. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4980.54s)]
*  Like you think- [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4981.74s)]
*  It's pretty close to Iraq and Afghanistan combined, right? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4982.58s)]
*  It feels that way to me. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4986.0599999999995s)]
*  You have the capacity for major urban violence, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4987.34s)]
*  a lot of Iraq, you have huge cities, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4990.74s)]
*  the Kabul is small, but you know, you have that. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4992.82s)]
*  And then additionally, you have the mountain element. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4995.58s)]
*  So any outlaw contingent can just flee there. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=4997.5s)]
*  I mean, and we learned this with our southern neighbor. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5003.22s)]
*  Why is Mexico ungovernable? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5006.26s)]
*  The mountains, you just fleet, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5007.7s)]
*  I mean, the entire coastline is- [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5010.7s)]
*  Why is Kentucky ungovernable? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5012.26s)]
*  Same reason. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5013.7s)]
*  Okay, yeah, yeah, I mean, so- [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5014.54s)]
*  Just kidding. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5016.34s)]
*  No, no, I mean, it's hard to, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5017.179999999999s)]
*  it would be very, very, very difficult. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5018.98s)]
*  And ask Saddam Hussein, who tried to invade Iran [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5020.98s)]
*  and didn't work out for Mr. Hussein. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5024.099999999999s)]
*  A lot of things didn't, so. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5026.5s)]
*  No, I agree completely. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5027.98s)]
*  Well, you have actually given me, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5031.58s)]
*  I asked you to come for this conversation. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5032.86s)]
*  It's late at night. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5035.78s)]
*  I was very exercised about it. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5036.78s)]
*  You were nice enough to come [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5037.9s)]
*  and more than a hotel room in some city, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5039.0199999999995s)]
*  but I thought it was gonna be more depressed by the end, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5041.0199999999995s)]
*  but actually I feel really heartened by what you said. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5045.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5048.62s)]
*  Well, thank you for making me feel a lot better. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5050.34s)]
*  Kurt Mills. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5053.26s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5054.099999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5054.94s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5055.78s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising, that's what they do, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5062.94s)]
*  but on another level, it's shocking. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5065.22s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5066.98s)]
*  all the change taking place in our economy and our politics, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5068.9s)]
*  with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5072.5s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5075.5s)]
*  rather than more. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5078.5s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5079.86s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5081.86s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5083.26s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5084.78s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5086.22s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5087.38s)]
*  or we could find a way around it, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5088.42s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that is true, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5089.7s)]
*  not intentionally deceptive. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5092.98s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5094.7s)]
*  it's to subscribe to our channel. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5096.78s)]
*  Subscribe, hit the little bell icon to be notified [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5098.3s)]
*  when we upload and share this video. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5101.26s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5103.66s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5105.82s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-wp7DXO9A&t=5108.78s)]
