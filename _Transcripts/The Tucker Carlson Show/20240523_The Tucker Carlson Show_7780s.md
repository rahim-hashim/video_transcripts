# Patrick Bet-David on Trump, Iran, and What Chris Cuomo Should Do with the Rest of His Life
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo)
*  But backgammon, like life, is like 30% luck. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=0.0s)]
*  So it's like a metaphor. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4.2s)]
*  Because there is a lot of luck. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6.2s)]
*  Out of five, out of five anybody could win. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=8.2s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Thank you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  But if you play three out of five, of five, the better player is going to win. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=12.6s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=17.0s)]
*  Patrick, Matt, David, May 22nd. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Oh my gosh. So he just said it's May 22nd. I don't know when this is going to air. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=23.2s)]
*  So who's going to win the presidential race and why? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=28.2s)]
*  Who's going to win the presidential race and why? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=32.2s)]
*  I think right now, if it ended today, right? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=35.2s)]
*  If it ended today and you looked at the states, Wisconsin, Biden has, you can go through the others. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=40.2s)]
*  Trump has a big lead, I believe in Arizona and another state by 11 points, 50 to 39. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=45.2s)]
*  He's got a 3-2 and 11 point lead on the six states that matter. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=50.2s)]
*  They're not even looking at North Carolina right now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=54.2s)]
*  It's going to be his, it's red. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=56.2s)]
*  We don't even want to report it as a battleground. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=58.2s)]
*  No, not even reporting it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=61.2s)]
*  So if it ends today, it's him that's going to win it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=62.2s)]
*  However, it's not ending today. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=66.2s)]
*  The amount of gamification that could happen between now and November 5th, it's endless. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=68.2s)]
*  Gamification? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=74.2s)]
*  Gamification, manipulation, you call it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=75.2s)]
*  There's a lot of things you can do. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=77.2s)]
*  So for me, there's a part of me where on the left side of my shoulder, it's a guy that says, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=78.2s)]
*  right, it's going to be great. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=83.2s)]
*  We're going to take over. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=84.2s)]
*  It's going to be awesome. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=85.2s)]
*  America is going to be the greatest country in the world and everything's going to be okay. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=86.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=89.2s)]
*  And there's another guy on this side that's super paranoid. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=90.2s)]
*  But what if? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=92.2s)]
*  Why would they be paranoid? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=93.2s)]
*  It's not like they're going to unleash a lab-grown virus on the world or like, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=94.2s)]
*  they would never do that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=98.2s)]
*  They're noble. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=99.2s)]
*  Provoke race riots and burn down your cities. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=100.2s)]
*  I don't think they wouldn't go that far with it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=101.2s)]
*  Why would they do such a thing? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=103.2s)]
*  They're unifiers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=104.2s)]
*  They're not trying to divide. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=105.2s)]
*  You know that, Tucker. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=106.2s)]
*  You've been a little bit too speculative. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=107.2s)]
*  I get cynical. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=109.2s)]
*  So I think what you're saying is, you know, if it plays out as elections are supposed [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=111.2s)]
*  to play out on the basis of what the population wants, then Trump has a big advantage. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=116.2s)]
*  But you are open to the possibility that there will be some sort of manipulation of the country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=121.2s)]
*  Oh, there's no question. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=129.2s)]
*  Only the paranoid survive. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=130.2s)]
*  And there's never been a time where we need to be paranoid about what could happen the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=132.2s)]
*  next few months. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=136.2s)]
*  Never. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=137.2s)]
*  All of a sudden, you show up saying you want to debate June 27th. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=138.2s)]
*  I debated him two times and I beat him two times. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=142.2s)]
*  You want it? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=145.2s)]
*  Come on, tough guy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=146.2s)]
*  June 27th. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=147.2s)]
*  And then you read the details. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=148.2s)]
*  Mike's going to go off the moment time's up. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=150.2s)]
*  Two, zero audience. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=153.2s)]
*  Why are we doing zero audience? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=154.2s)]
*  Well, you know, we're just going back to the way it was with Nixon and Kennedy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=155.2s)]
*  And then the next day, 50 articles come out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=159.2s)]
*  It would become traditional on how this whole thing about debate on TV started with Nixon [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=162.2s)]
*  and Kennedy with no audience. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=167.2s)]
*  That's the right way to do it so the audience can decide for themselves who the better debater [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=168.2s)]
*  is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=172.2s)]
*  But listen, the last time we did without an audience was in 1960, 1960, whatever the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=173.2s)]
*  timeline was with those two. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=178.2s)]
*  We've always had an audience. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=180.2s)]
*  The audience said, well, you guys got to keep it down. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=181.2s)]
*  But they know what's going to happen where he's going to have his moments where he says [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=183.2s)]
*  because you'd be in jail and they're worried about those things. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=186.2s)]
*  However, here's what's going to happen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=189.2s)]
*  I think as much as they try to protect them, as much as they try to protect them to kind [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=192.2s)]
*  of see what's going to happen with that, what percentage of people do you think that consume [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=197.2s)]
*  the debate are the type that consume highlight reels like a game? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=202.2s)]
*  I don't watch full games, but I'll watch a highlight reel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=207.2s)]
*  I'll watch Sports Center. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=210.2s)]
*  I'll watch some of the clips on Twitter to see, oh, look at this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=212.2s)]
*  Oh, wow, good for these guys. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=214.2s)]
*  They won. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=215.2s)]
*  What percentage you think of voters are going to watch the entire thing on TV, on CNN versus [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=217.2s)]
*  what percentage you think are going to get the highlight reels on Instagram and Twitter? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=223.2s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=227.2s)]
*  I mean, I think it's overwhelming. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=229.2s)]
*  The percentage who will watch portions of it rather than the whole thing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=231.2s)]
*  You think it's 80 20 at least. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=234.2s)]
*  OK, so who cares? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=236.2s)]
*  So part of me is like, OK, go ahead. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=237.2s)]
*  Do what you want to do with this, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=239.2s)]
*  Because the clips on this side that they're going to cut it, edit it, put it out there, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=242.2s)]
*  the audience is going to go at it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=246.2s)]
*  You're going to see the polls. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=248.2s)]
*  You're going to see the reactions. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=250.2s)]
*  You're going to see who's going to be better editors nowadays. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=251.2s)]
*  The better editing team creating better clips in a fast manner with the right music, with [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=253.2s)]
*  the right creative B-roll and things you add to it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=259.2s)]
*  Trump's camp is a better marketer. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=263.2s)]
*  They've always been better marketers. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=265.2s)]
*  The other side has no clue how to do marketing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=267.2s)]
*  But maybe the bar is lower for Biden. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=269.2s)]
*  I mean, you see these clips of him daily drooling and mangling names and identifying his sister [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=270.2s)]
*  as his wife, and he's just so out of it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=275.2s)]
*  And then they juice him up on something to the point where, as at the State of the Union, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=278.2s)]
*  he seems sort of non-senile. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=282.2s)]
*  So maybe if he pulls that off, why doesn't Trump just say like, what drugs are you on? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=284.2s)]
*  Why don't you just close that? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=288.2s)]
*  Maybe he will. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=289.2s)]
*  Maybe he'll ask it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=290.2s)]
*  And, you know, saying the things about calling his sister his wife, that's his personal business. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=291.2s)]
*  It's not your business, Tucker. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=296.2s)]
*  I mean, I don't know why you're getting this. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=297.2s)]
*  How he arranges this personal life. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=299.2s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever been to West Virginia. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=301.2s)]
*  People live in different ways. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=302.2s)]
*  There's different standards. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=303.2s)]
*  I mean, I don't think we should judge that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=304.2s)]
*  Totally, totally fair. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=305.2s)]
*  And by the way, compared to the trans stuff, that's not that weird. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=306.2s)]
*  So how do you rate the peril to Trump personally, physical peril? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=309.2s)]
*  Oh, you mean the two of them going up against each other? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=315.2s)]
*  No, no, no, no. Two Trump now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=318.2s)]
*  So Trump's way ahead, actually, farther ahead than a candidate typically is in May of an election year. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=319.2s)]
*  And we sort of know that that's the red line. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=326.2s)]
*  Can't have Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=329.2s)]
*  So I've asked him this directly. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=330.2s)]
*  Didn't get an answer. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=332.2s)]
*  But do you worry that he could be harmed between now and then? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=333.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, Zachy briefly said, you know, the risk that he stands in a most indirect way. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=336.2s)]
*  And Jen Psaki. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=342.2s)]
*  Yes. And I don't know if you've seen the movie Civil War that just came out. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=344.2s)]
*  If you've seen the movie Civil War, it's about a it's a commercial for Reuters. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=348.2s)]
*  Left wing journalist and depicting the president of the time during the Civil War of an identical character played as Donald Trump and the hero of the movie. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=354.2s)]
*  To my knowledge, the way I saw the movie was the person that assassinates the president last minute in the last minute of the movie. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=367.2s)]
*  The president playing the role of Trump gets assassinated in the movie. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=376.2s)]
*  How many people does that movie need to inspire for somebody to be so I haven't seen it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=380.2s)]
*  But if so, the assassin, the Lee Harvey Oswald or is the hero at the end, probably not actually assessment, whatever it he's the hero. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=385.2s)]
*  The guy who murders the president is the hero in the movie. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=393.2s)]
*  The way they sell it is that the president playing the character of Trump is an evil man who made this movie. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=396.2s)]
*  It's very different than the other movie that was made Leave the World Behind by Obama's and Julia Roberts. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=405.2s)]
*  This actually had a decent cast for the movie. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=410.2s)]
*  It's a very hard movie to watch. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=413.2s)]
*  Leave the World Behind was actually a better produced movie, more dark, more deceptive, extremely divisive, a lot of messaging in their predictive programming, stuff that you can watch and say this can actually happen one day. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=415.2s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, look, a lot of what I don't know if you've seen movie John Q. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=430.2s)]
*  First time I watched John Q. Denzel Washington. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=434.2s)]
*  Do you know the story about John? No. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=437.2s)]
*  OK, so it's a story about a father whose son is a fan of flex. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=439.2s)]
*  We he wants to be a bodybuilder and a son. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=443.2s)]
*  All of a sudden, heart collapses. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=445.2s)]
*  And I think it's in the middle of a baseball game. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=446.2s)]
*  They take him to the hospital. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=448.2s)]
*  It's going to cost two hundred fifty thousand dollars to do surgery. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=450.2s)]
*  And the company doesn't offer, you know, allowing him to get the insurance because he doesn't have the best insurance and he's trying to go raise the money. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=453.2s)]
*  He can't raise the money. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=462.2s)]
*  It's pointing a picture of a father about to lose a son because the hospital is not willing to spend two hundred fifty thousand dollars to save this kid's life. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=463.2s)]
*  Right. And you are going through this emotional roller coaster ride with the father. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=471.2s)]
*  How many fathers are going to sit there and say, holy shit, what is this all about? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=477.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=480.2s)]
*  And then eventually there's a scene where he tells Kevin Connolly, the actor from Entourage, and he says, Listen, guys, just take it out of my heart and give it to him. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=481.2s)]
*  It's this unique scene. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=492.2s)]
*  It's like I'm not going to do that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=493.2s)]
*  If you're not going to do it, I'm going to kill myself. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=494.2s)]
*  You're going to take it out of my heart and you're going to give it to my son. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=495.2s)]
*  Intense, intense movie. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=497.2s)]
*  Then while they're there, he's talking to his son, son is laying on the bed at the hospital and says, Look, here's what I want you to think about. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=500.2s)]
*  He says, My son buries me. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=508.2s)]
*  I don't bury my son. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=511.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=512.2s)]
*  My son buries me. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=513.2s)]
*  That's how it needs to be. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=514.2s)]
*  So you're like, yeah. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=515.2s)]
*  And as a father, you're feeling it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=517.2s)]
*  Well, that was right before Obamacare. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=519.2s)]
*  How many people did that movie influence to say, you know what, we do need affordable care. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=522.2s)]
*  You know, so movies have a lot of power. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=527.2s)]
*  I mean, if you go back in the days, do you know who produced the first Titanic, the movie? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=529.2s)]
*  No. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=534.2s)]
*  It's a guy named Adolf Hitler. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=535.2s)]
*  You know who the hero was in the movie, the first Titanic iceberg? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=537.2s)]
*  The first hero in the movie is the Nazi soldier. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=540.2s)]
*  If you go and pull up first Titanic produced by Germany, Adolf Hitler, the hero is painted as the Nazi soldier. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=545.2s)]
*  The way you confuse propaganda storytelling is movies, docs, music, you know this. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=556.2s)]
*  I mean, this is how you get the audience and the younger audience to buy it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=563.2s)]
*  So you mean to tell me the movie Civil War cannot inspire one kid to want to be a hero [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=566.2s)]
*  and being written about for the rest of his life in history books? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=571.2s)]
*  You mean to tell me one kid's not going to be inspired by? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=573.2s)]
*  So I worry about some of this predictive programming they're putting because they're going to say, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=575.2s)]
*  well, you can't just say it was a movie that did it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=579.2s)]
*  Doesn't take a lot of stuff to get a young kid to be inspired to do something. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=581.2s)]
*  So that's my part that's a little bit worrisome about what could happen in the future. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=585.2s)]
*  But yeah, I think they're willing to do anything and anything, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=589.2s)]
*  everything and anything to not get him in the White House because they worry if they do, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=593.2s)]
*  they're going to lose their membership. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=597.2s)]
*  I don't know. I saw what James Comey said yesterday. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=599.2s)]
*  He got emotional. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=601.2s)]
*  If he gets in there, he's going to completely change everything with our justice system. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=603.2s)]
*  He's going to do everything with FBI. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=607.2s)]
*  Such liars. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=609.2s)]
*  And he's going to put some bad people in there. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=610.2s)]
*  And I'm telling you guys, this is the week. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=611.2s)]
*  You cannot, you cannot vote for Trump. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=613.2s)]
*  You have to support. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=615.2s)]
*  I've never seen Comey be this animated about Biden being a president. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=617.2s)]
*  This just happened yesterday. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=622.2s)]
*  So there's a lot of people that are worried about. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=623.2s)]
*  You got to wonder as you listen to Comey talk or Brennan or all these former agency heads of the most powerful agencies in the world. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=625.2s)]
*  These guys still have security clearances. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=631.2s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=633.2s)]
*  For sure. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=635.2s)]
*  They use them for their jobs. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=636.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=637.2s)]
*  That's a privilege, not a right. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=638.2s)]
*  And those should be revoked immediately by Donald Trump day fucking one. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=639.2s)]
*  Why do those guys still have security clearances? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=644.2s)]
*  I mean, if you're if you believe in democracy, if you think that the people who live in the country own the country, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=646.2s)]
*  it's their government and they have a say in how it's run and that that government should reflect their priorities over time. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=651.2s)]
*  And I think we all claim to believe that then you can't have unelected agency heads or retired, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=656.2s)]
*  unelected agency heads running everything behind the scenes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=663.2s)]
*  That's just absolutely antithetical to democracy. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=666.2s)]
*  So why do these guys continue to be allowed legally to run the government from outside the government? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=668.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=676.2s)]
*  So that's not hard, is it? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=677.2s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=679.2s)]
*  But everybody everybody is ambitious in their own way, some more, some less. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=680.2s)]
*  But if you look at the profile of the top ambitious people that they go on different routes. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=684.2s)]
*  OK, one is going to be fame. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=689.2s)]
*  I want to be a celebrity. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=691.2s)]
*  I want people to stop me and say, can I take a picture with you, Tucker? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=692.2s)]
*  I want to do a selfie. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=695.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=696.2s)]
*  I'm famous. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=697.2s)]
*  Did you see this? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=698.2s)]
*  That's ambitious. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=699.2s)]
*  I'm going to be famous one day. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=700.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=701.2s)]
*  OK, great. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=702.2s)]
*  Then the other one is ambitious. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=703.2s)]
*  We're going to be millionaires. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=704.2s)]
*  We're going to be billionaires. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=705.2s)]
*  We're going to have all the money in the world. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=706.2s)]
*  OK, great. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=707.2s)]
*  So one is fame. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=708.2s)]
*  The other one is money. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=710.2s)]
*  The other one is power to tell you what to do. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=711.2s)]
*  The money, guys, it's a number. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=715.2s)]
*  You can measure it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=718.2s)]
*  You can see this guy's winning because his net worth is 200 billion dollars. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=719.2s)]
*  His name is Elon Musk. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=722.2s)]
*  This guy's number two at 180 billion dollars. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=723.2s)]
*  This guy's number three hundred sixty five billion, you know, Zuck. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=725.2s)]
*  There's a leader's bulletin for it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=728.2s)]
*  Fame. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=729.2s)]

*  Right. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=736.2s)]
*  How do you measure politics? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=737.2s)]
*  How do you measure? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=738.2s)]
*  What's the resume on measuring success in politics? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=739.2s)]
*  And somebody working for the federal government, working for, you know, an FBI or CIA and, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=742.2s)]
*  you know, and I know you're not very familiar with this organization called CIA, but it's [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=749.2s)]
*  a rough organization. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=753.2s)]
*  It's a very interesting organization. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=754.2s)]
*  You should look into them. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=755.2s)]
*  Some interesting people have gone through there. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=756.2s)]
*  But so you see what do they want? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=758.2s)]
*  What are they driven by? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=759.2s)]
*  What do they want to do? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=760.2s)]
*  Is their ambition what? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=762.2s)]
*  Is it money? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=763.2s)]
*  No. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=764.2s)]
*  Is it fame? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=765.2s)]
*  Fame is actually straight up. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=766.2s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=767.2s)]
*  You want to be famous? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=768.2s)]
*  Go do X, Y, Z. You want to make money? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=769.2s)]
*  Go do X, Y, Z. But the power people? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=771.2s)]
*  Oof. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=773.2s)]
*  You got to be very careful with them. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=774.2s)]
*  A lot of times, like the way you... [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=775.2s)]
*  Well, so how do you measure power? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=778.2s)]
*  So the way you see, and this is the, it's easy in the business world. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=779.2s)]
*  Say a guy, I had Michael Franzese on years ago when he and I started doing podcasts, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=783.2s)]
*  did a couple of interviews with him. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=788.2s)]
*  Good guy. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=790.2s)]
*  And in the mob world. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=791.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=792.2s)]
*  And he's a good guy. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=793.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=794.2s)]
*  So he took me, we went to New York because I was going to interview his father, Sonny [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=795.2s)]
*  Franzese. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=799.2s)]
*  And Sonny is a guy that comes from the era of Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Frank Costello, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=800.2s)]
*  Ben Siegel. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=808.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=809.2s)]
*  He comes from that era. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=810.2s)]
*  I love that you're calling him Ben Siegel. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=811.2s)]
*  You can't say buddy, right? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=812.2s)]
*  You got to say Ben. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=813.2s)]
*  So good. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=814.2s)]
*  Let me tell you how I met him. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=815.2s)]
*  I met the guy who murdered him and he kept his arrow when I was a kid. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=816.2s)]
*  No shit. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=819.2s)]
*  Yeah, killed him in 1947. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=820.2s)]
*  He's a friend of my dad's. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=821.2s)]
*  So I have dinner at his house and yeah, he murdered Bugsy Siegel. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=822.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=826.2s)]
*  Shot him in the face with a .30 caliber. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=827.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=829.2s)]
*  Big round. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=830.2s)]
*  What was it like when you talked to him? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=831.2s)]
*  Hitting the face. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=832.2s)]
*  He never married, never had kids. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=833.2s)]
*  He was a cat guy. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=834.2s)]
*  He collected stray cats and my father loved animals and was good friends with Eddie Kanisar. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=835.2s)]
*  My brother and I would take us over for dinner, make cannelloni, live with his parents. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=840.2s)]
*  It was all very weird. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=843.2s)]
*  Anyway, but he killed Bugsy Siegel. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=845.2s)]
*  But I remember hearing the conversation yet, don't call him Bugsy. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=846.2s)]
*  He wasn't. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=849.2s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=850.2s)]
*  So we go out and I'm like, I'm trying to convince Sonny. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=851.2s)]
*  Let me interview you. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=854.2s)]
*  He says, for 55 years, I've never, I went to jail for 55 years. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=856.2s)]
*  The only thing I can take to my grave is I never snitched on anybody. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=860.2s)]
*  This is not a lie. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=863.2s)]
*  This guy did 55 years in jail out of 103 years of living. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=864.2s)]
*  Never said anything to nobody. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=868.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=870.2s)]
*  I get him in the car, taking him to his favorite Italian restaurant. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=871.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=875.2s)]
*  We pick him up from the old folks home and I'm driving. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=876.2s)]
*  So Sonny, what can you tell me about Meyer Lansky? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=879.2s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=882.2s)]
*  I heard he made a lot of money in many different ways. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=883.2s)]
*  Phenomenal guy. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=886.2s)]
*  What we can say about Bugsy Siegel, don't say that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=887.2s)]
*  You can't say that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=890.2s)]
*  You call him Ben. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=891.2s)]
*  What can you tell me about Ben? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=892.2s)]
*  Very good guy. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=893.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=894.2s)]
*  How about Frank Costello? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=895.2s)]
*  Fantastic guy. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=896.2s)]
*  How about everybody's a good guy like Sonny? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=897.2s)]
*  Come on, Sonny. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=900.2s)]
*  I mean, these are stand-up guys. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=901.2s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about, stand-up guys. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=903.2s)]
*  Sonny eventually doesn't agree to do the interview. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=905.2s)]
*  That interview never happens. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=908.2s)]
*  Okay? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=909.2s)]
*  But Sonny told his son, he said, be very careful of the people [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=910.2s)]
*  that are lower power people in the mob family [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=914.2s)]
*  because one day they could be a boss. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=916.2s)]
*  And when they do become a boss, they're going to remember [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=918.2s)]
*  every way you disrespect them. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=920.2s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=922.2s)]
*  They're going to seek their vengeance on you in their own way. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=923.2s)]
*  So be very careful to the lower level people that are coming up. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=925.2s)]
*  One day they could be your boss. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=929.2s)]
*  Okay? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=930.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=931.2s)]
*  So you're running a company. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=932.2s)]
*  You see a guy that's been with you for five years. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=936.2s)]
*  He's doing a good job. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=938.2s)]
*  He's at work. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=939.2s)]
*  He does 60 hours a week, stand-up guy, effort, attitude, teamwork, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=940.2s)]
*  innovation, results, competency, specialized skill. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=943.2s)]
*  He's got all that stuff. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=946.2s)]
*  Then all of a sudden, he goes from being a performer. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=947.2s)]
*  Maybe he's got one or two people reporting to him. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=950.2s)]
*  You make him a VP, and now he's got 35 people under his division. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=952.2s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you see him become a tyrant and a dictator. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=956.2s)]
*  Like, wait a minute. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=961.2s)]
*  Did it just happen overnight? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=963.2s)]
*  Or was that always in there, but you were hiding it and boom, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=965.2s)]
*  now that you have the power, now you're abusing it, right? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=969.2s)]
*  A lot of these people on the political side, deep down inside, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=973.2s)]
*  someone offended them, a mom, a dad, a cousin, an ex, a friend, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=977.2s)]
*  a professor, a teacher, somebody. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=982.2s)]
*  And their way of seeking vengeance is to have control over other people. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=984.2s)]
*  Lincoln said, you want to find out, test someone's character, give them power. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=988.2s)]
*  These guys now have power and they're showing what they're all about. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=993.2s)]
*  And they fear somebody coming in that's a non-establishment guy coming in. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=996.2s)]
*  They could lose that and be exposed. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1000.2s)]
*  They're not willing to give that up. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1002.2s)]
*  They're not willing to give that up. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1004.2s)]
*  It's going to take everything they can to take that privilege away from them. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1005.2s)]
*  And that's not going to be an easy thing for Trump to do. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1008.2s)]
*  You may have come to the obvious conclusion that the real debate is not [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1011.2s)]
*  between Republican and Democrat or Socialist and Capitalist, right, left. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1014.2s)]
*  The real battle is between people who are lying on purpose and people who are [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1020.2s)]
*  trying to tell you the truth. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1024.2s)]
*  It's between good and evil. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1026.2s)]
*  It's between honesty and falsehood. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1028.2s)]
*  And we hope we are on the former side. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1031.2s)]
*  That's why we created this network, the Tucker Carlson Network. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1033.2s)]
*  And we invite you to subscribe to it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1036.2s)]
*  You go to tuckercarlson.com slash podcast. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1038.2s)]
*  Our entire archive is there. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1041.2s)]
*  A lot of behind the scenes footage of what actually happens in this barn [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1042.2s)]
*  when only an iPhone is running. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1046.2s)]
*  So tuckercarlson.com slash podcast. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1048.2s)]
*  You will not regret it. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1052.2s)]
*  I guess the difficulty for the power-worshipping community is that they [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1054.2s)]
*  already did this in 2020. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1061.2s)]
*  And now that tempers have cooled and people can think clearly, they stole the election. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1063.2s)]
*  Nobody actually thinks that was a free and fair election. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1068.2s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1071.2s)]
*  And so the bar is a lot higher. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1072.2s)]
*  How do you do that again? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1074.2s)]
*  And if you do it again, everyone's going to know you did it again. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1075.2s)]
*  And then what kind of country do you have in January of 2025? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1078.2s)]
*  Steady trends. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1082.2s)]
*  Trends. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1083.2s)]
*  If you're a great stockbroker, you're somebody that looks at trends, seasons, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1084.2s)]
*  months, days, announcements, quarterly calls, you know, industry, market, election. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1089.2s)]
*  You have to look at everything on the board to say, according to this, an XYZ, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1094.2s)]
*  and what's going on right now, this should happen next in the next quarter. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1099.2s)]
*  Go to the history books and look at, well, when we raise the interest rate this many times, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1103.2s)]
*  here's what happened next. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1106.2s)]
*  When we were going through inflation, you look at all the case studies. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1107.2s)]
*  Like when COVID first happened, Jennifer and I are in Beverly Hills. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1110.2s)]
*  We're about to have a board meeting. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1114.2s)]
*  And then last meeting, everybody that's supposed to fly in cancels it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1116.2s)]
*  But I'm like, what the hell is going on? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1120.2s)]
*  We brought the kids. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1121.2s)]
*  We're about to go to Universal. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1122.2s)]
*  That's the day Rudy Gobert gave Donovan Mitchell from the Utah Jazz COVID. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1123.2s)]
*  And, you know, NHL shuts down, NBA shuts down. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1127.2s)]
*  That's the day. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1130.2s)]
*  Disney shuts down. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1131.2s)]
*  And then we're like, what the hell is going on? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1132.2s)]
*  We got to fly back. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1134.2s)]
*  We fly back to Dallas. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1135.2s)]
*  I take the family to the house. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1137.2s)]
*  I come back to the office and I'm studying all the different pandemics that we've had. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1138.2s)]
*  And you'll see out of all the pandemics we've had, how the market has reacted. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1141.2s)]
*  90% of the top 10 pandemics we've had, massive market drop off. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1145.2s)]
*  But every one of them six months later, it came back to exactly what it used to be, if not higher. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1151.2s)]
*  There's only one that didn't recover for 12 months, and that's AIDS. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1157.2s)]
*  Everything else, six month recovery, right? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1160.2s)]
*  So I could sit there and say, well, this could be fear porn. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1162.2s)]
*  Market's going to go down to 18,000, 17,000, whatever could happen. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1167.2s)]
*  But it's fear. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1171.2s)]
*  It's going to come back up six months later. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1172.2s)]
*  It's exactly what happened, right? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1173.2s)]
*  Boom, boom, came back up. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1174.2s)]
*  OK, so trends, things to study, patterns on what's going on with today. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1176.2s)]
*  If we go to 2016 election, the mistake mainstream media made was what? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1182.2s)]
*  CNN kept inviting Trump. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1188.2s)]
*  He said yes. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1189.2s)]
*  They kept inviting him. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1190.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1191.2s)]
*  MSNBC, yes. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1192.2s)]
*  We're getting all these crazy ratings. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1193.2s)]
*  We're killing at MSNBC. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1195.2s)]
*  No, he's bringing you ratings. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1196.2s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they're like, guys, we created a monster. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1198.2s)]
*  It's too late. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1202.2s)]
*  We've done a half a billion dollars of free media advertisement for this guy. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1204.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1208.2s)]
*  And he didn't even need to spend the money on it. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1209.2s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1211.2s)]
*  He just won. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1213.2s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1215.2s)]
*  This didn't work. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1217.2s)]
*  The defamation and all this stuff. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1219.2s)]
*  Damn, guys, this is not going to work in 2020. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1221.2s)]
*  So go to 2020. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1224.2s)]
*  What did they do in 2020? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1225.2s)]
*  We got to find a different playbook. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1227.2s)]
*  2016, they used Me Too, backfired on them when Trump brought the candidates, showing [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1228.2s)]
*  in all this other stuff, right? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1233.2s)]
*  And he's like, well, let me tell you who we have here. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1235.2s)]
*  Paula Disson, you see Clinton looking like this, that famous picture. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1237.2s)]
*  Oh, I was there for that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1240.2s)]
*  So 2020. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1241.2s)]
*  All of Bill Clinton's girlfriends. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1242.2s)]
*  Pretty impressive. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1244.2s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1245.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1246.2s)]
*  2020, May 25th. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1247.2s)]
*  You need chaos. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1250.2s)]
*  May 25th, what happens? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1252.2s)]
*  George Floyd gets assassinated. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1254.2s)]
*  George Floyd dies. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1255.2s)]
*  Now he gets assassinated. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1256.2s)]
*  The word they wanted to kind of use was obviously a bigger thing, but George Floyd, the number [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1257.2s)]
*  of minutes that it took place, me, all that stuff. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1262.2s)]
*  Next day, riots, protesting, insanity. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1265.2s)]
*  What do Republicans start saying? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1269.2s)]
*  Look, man, I like him, but I don't know why. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1271.2s)]
*  Maybe they're right. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1273.2s)]
*  The more he's in there, the more chaos happens in the streets. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1274.2s)]
*  And I just want the chaos to slow down. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1276.2s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1278.2s)]
*  Of course. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1280.2s)]
*  That strategy worked very effectively. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1281.2s)]
*  Here's what they're doing in 2024 that you can see some case studies of what they're [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1283.2s)]
*  doing, what's not going to work. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1287.2s)]
*  What are they doing in 2024 that they haven't learned their lesson? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1288.2s)]
*  They're making a mistake that they made in 2016, but they're doing it in a different [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1291.2s)]
*  way. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1296.2s)]
*  2016, all CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS ever talked about was what? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1297.2s)]
*  Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, but they invited him. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1302.2s)]
*  Well, they're not inviting him now, but what are they doing? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1304.2s)]
*  Because he's in court and all these different cases, they have to keep talking about him [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1307.2s)]
*  over and over thinking that strategy is going to work for them because they're getting ratings. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1312.2s)]
*  What they're not realizing, again, they're coming the best publicist PR for this guy. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1317.2s)]
*  And now it's like, oh my God, it's backfiring on us again. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1322.2s)]
*  Look at the black vote in 2020. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1326.2s)]
*  He only had 9% in 2024. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1329.2s)]
*  He's got 22% of the African-American vote. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1333.2s)]
*  And what's even worse than this, the people that are above 65, 81% of them are for Democrat [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1337.2s)]
*  and most of these guys, but the younger audience we're losing. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1344.2s)]
*  This is not good if we're losing younger audience. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1348.2s)]
*  If we lose the younger audience, could this be a Barry Goldwater? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1350.2s)]
*  Well, the African-American vote flips for the next three decades. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1353.2s)]
*  They're now seeing that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1356.2s)]
*  This strategy is not working. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1358.2s)]
*  However, the part that you have to see the case study is the following. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1360.2s)]
*  So pinning Muslims against Jews, against Christians, against pro-Palestine, against Gaza, Hamas, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1364.2s)]
*  pro-Israel, all this stuff. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1371.2s)]
*  You can have your own position. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1373.2s)]
*  We can all have our own position. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1374.2s)]
*  We don't need to go there if you don't want to go there. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1376.2s)]
*  But here's the part. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1378.2s)]
*  Where they're winning is what? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1379.2s)]
*  Kids in schools, riots, protesting, and they're doing what they're doing. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1381.2s)]
*  All they're waiting for is the next George Floyd. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1385.2s)]
*  That's all they need. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1387.2s)]
*  They need their next George Floyd. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1388.2s)]
*  And what month are we in right now? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1389.2s)]
*  Today is what? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1391.2s)]
*  May 22nd. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1392.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1393.2s)]
*  May 25th is coming up in three days. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1394.2s)]
*  May 26th is in a few days. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1396.2s)]
*  They need chaos back again, except they're going to do it in a different way. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1398.2s)]
*  I keep thinking that about the Israel-Palestine thing. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1402.2s)]
*  I'm probably the only person in the world who doesn't have very strong feelings on it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1404.2s)]
*  I like Israel. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1408.2s)]
*  I'm not against the Palestinians. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1409.2s)]
*  I'm just kind of agnostic. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1410.2s)]
*  I'm just too American for this whole conversation. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1411.2s)]
*  But when that becomes the biggest news story in the United States, a conflict across the globe, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1413.2s)]
*  and when these protests are blown so out of proportion by all news media, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1421.2s)]
*  you have to think maybe this is not a reflection of reality. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1426.2s)]
*  Maybe I'm being played here a little bit, right? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1430.2s)]
*  Or maybe I'm being played a lot. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1433.2s)]
*  Well, maybe you are. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1435.2s)]
*  I want to apologize because I didn't start off by congratulating you on your, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1436.2s)]
*  one of the most honest outlets out there, Newsweek, reporting your massive contract you signed with Russian TV. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1441.2s)]
*  Congratulations on that. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1446.2s)]
*  It's just part of my ongoing business relationship with Vladimir Putin. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1447.2s)]
*  No, they, of course, I never even contemplated it. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1450.2s)]
*  I have no idea what they're talking about. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1453.2s)]
*  I have nothing to do with Russian media. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1455.2s)]
*  I couldn't even identify three Russian media outlets, of course. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1456.2s)]
*  I don't speak Russian. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1459.2s)]
*  But that's a pretext for a FISA warrant. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1460.2s)]
*  So you put that out there and Newsweek knows this, and they're mad at me for other reasons, of course. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1464.2s)]
*  And they put this out there, and all of a sudden it gives the Biden administration an excuse to spy on me, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1470.2s)]
*  which they already are and have been over the last several years. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1477.2s)]
*  But what's crazy is you can live in a country where that's completely illegal, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1481.2s)]
*  and everyone knows it's happening, and nobody says anything about it. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1487.2s)]
*  And the only people who do say anything about it, like Julian Assange or Ed Snowden, they're the ones facing life in prison. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1491.2s)]
*  It's a little bit upside down. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1497.2s)]
*  I would say, no, but that story, look, the media don't just mislead you. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1502.2s)]
*  They're not just worker bees for the Democratic Party. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1506.2s)]
*  They want to hurt you, actually hurt you, put you in prison or kill you. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1512.2s)]
*  They're that involved in the machinery of internal repression in this country. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1518.2s)]
*  You're not saying that the DOJ would ever give permission to use deadly force when they're invading a former prison. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1525.2s)]
*  When they're going through Melania's underwear drawers? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1533.2s)]
*  That would never happen. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1535.2s)]
*  Yeah, Melania shows up and says, why are you going through my nightgowns? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1536.2s)]
*  Bam! Deadly force. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1538.2s)]
*  So I would say that the problem that we have as people who are not part of the machine, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1540.2s)]
*  it's not even a right or left question. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1548.2s)]
*  It's are you on the side of lies or are you not? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1551.2s)]
*  We don't understand just how serious they are. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1553.2s)]
*  I mean, if you were running DOJ and you saw a search warrant that said, yes, the use of deadly force applies in a documents case, a classified documents case. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1557.2s)]
*  By the way, the documents were meaningless. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1567.2s)]
*  No one's ever shown otherwise. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1569.2s)]
*  Doesn't matter. You can put them on the Internet now. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1571.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter, actually. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1573.2s)]
*  And if you were the attorney general and you were looking through the warrant and said use of deadly forces is allowed, you'd say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1575.2s)]
*  We're literally rooting through Melania's dresser. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1582.2s)]
*  We don't need to use deadly. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1586.2s)]
*  Wouldn't you say that just as a someone who believes in fairness and sanity? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1587.2s)]
*  The fact that you're putting that in there to give permission and it's just kind of, you know, water under. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1591.2s)]
*  Yeah, no worries. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1599.2s)]
*  Next news cycle. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1600.2s)]
*  It's not a big story. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1601.2s)]
*  Next news site. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1603.2s)]
*  It's not a big story. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1604.2s)]
*  But what does it say? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1605.2s)]
*  It says that they're serious enough to kill you. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1606.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1608.2s)]
*  They're good. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1609.2s)]
*  Zola Lyra got murdered in Ukrainian prison. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1610.2s)]
*  This course run by the State Department and CIA basically killed by the Biden administration. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1613.2s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1617.2s)]
*  I mean, at least that there's an American citizen, but at least the confidence comes the fact that never in the history of US has the government ever assassinated the president. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1619.2s)]
*  So it's not like that kind of person who's a very ambitious vice president would never do that to become a president historically and within minutes want to be sworn in that. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1626.2s)]
*  It sounds like a dangerous conspiracy theory to me. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1636.2s)]
*  So let me ask you, though. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1638.2s)]
*  So it's pretty clear to me that two summers ago, so August 2022, when that deadly force raid on Mar-a-Lago took place and they rooted through the former First Lady's underwear, that was the moment when Trump kind of came back like DeSantis was done. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1639.2s)]
*  This is my read on it. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1655.2s)]
*  The more they persecute Trump unfairly, the more transparently grotesque and corrupted is the stronger Trump becomes. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1657.2s)]
*  I mean, I think that seems pretty obvious. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1665.2s)]
*  There's been polling on this. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1667.2s)]
*  Do you think that people who did it knew that would happen? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1669.2s)]
*  Like how much like how much of like this did they think through? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1671.2s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1676.2s)]
*  I actually don't think they thought it would happen. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1677.2s)]
*  I think they think it's working. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1680.2s)]
*  I think they think it's working. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1682.2s)]
*  And now it's too late. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1684.2s)]
*  Michael Cohen, did you steal from the Trump Organization? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1686.2s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1690.2s)]
*  I did. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1691.2s)]
*  What? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1692.2s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1693.2s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1694.2s)]
*  So now CNN has to somebody on CNN has to say it's over for this guy. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1696.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1700.2s)]
*  So this is this is another reason why sometimes when people are we're going to sue those guys. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1701.2s)]
*  Go ahead and do it. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1707.2s)]
*  Then comes discovery. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1708.2s)]
*  You got to also give me your discovery. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1709.2s)]
*  Right. Meaning so when you're suing, I want to see your discovery. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1711.2s)]
*  Give me your disk. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1714.2s)]
*  Let's go through it. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1715.2s)]
*  You're suing me. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1716.2s)]
*  Great. Let's go through. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1717.2s)]
*  I want to see discovery on text exchange, email exchange. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1718.2s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1720.2s)]
*  No, no, we don't want to do that. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1721.2s)]
*  But that's how lawsuits work. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1723.2s)]
*  I want also discovery. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1724.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1725.2s)]
*  So now it's backfiring. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1726.2s)]
*  Now they have to sit there. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1728.2s)]
*  I mean, if we really play this thing out, I'd be curious with you. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1730.2s)]
*  Why do you think they chose to all of a sudden flip June 27th debate? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1733.2s)]
*  And then next one's going to be, you know, in September. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1739.2s)]
*  And first one, I think is CNN. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1741.2s)]
*  Second one, I think it's ABC, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1743.2s)]
*  Why do you think all of a sudden they flip so quickly? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1745.2s)]
*  Are you part of the camp that thinks maybe they're trying to see how good he's going to be to kind of replace him? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1748.2s)]
*  Or what is the motive of trying to do it? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1752.2s)]
*  I mean, there are many levels, and I don't know the answer. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1754.2s)]
*  I think it's getting a little late to try and replace him, honestly. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1757.2s)]
*  And I think that'd be a pretty hard sell. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1760.2s)]
*  And with whom and what do you do with Kamala? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1762.2s)]
*  This is the problem with DEI, with elevating people beyond their capacity, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1764.2s)]
*  taking like a true mouth breathing moron like Kamala Harrison making her vice president. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1768.2s)]
*  Like they are, these are the wages of sin that they're dealing with now, and I'm really glad to see it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1773.2s)]
*  So I don't know that they replace them. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1777.2s)]
*  I don't know how they can. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1778.2s)]
*  Maybe they're more clever than I am and have a plan. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1779.2s)]
*  I think it's as simple as the guy who's down wants a debate. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1781.2s)]
*  He needs to change the storyline. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1785.2s)]
*  You know, the trend is hurting Joe Biden. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1787.2s)]
*  It's not his friend. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1790.2s)]
*  And so they got to do something like one on a debate, you know. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1791.2s)]
*  And again, it comes back to to pharmacology like they're injecting him with drugs. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1795.2s)]
*  And so for a short period of time, he can seem sentient and aware and semi capable, old, but not. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1802.2s)]
*  Vegetable. The rest time he is a vegetable. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1809.2s)]
*  And I think they can get away with that for an hour and a half or two hours. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1812.2s)]
*  And I think that's I mean, again, I don't know. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1816.2s)]
*  But my guess is they think they just have to show that he's not as senile as you think he is. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1819.2s)]
*  And that's going to be enough. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1823.2s)]
*  It was at the at the. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1825.2s)]
*  Did you watch State of the Union? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1827.2s)]
*  I did. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1828.2s)]
*  He didn't seem quite as retarded as he normally does. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1829.2s)]
*  No, no, he didn't. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1831.2s)]
*  And that's drugs. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1833.2s)]
*  I mean, I, I know someone, a makeup artist who worked on Joe Biden. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1834.2s)]
*  During the 2020 campaign, who was there when he got the drugs, like in the room with the doctor. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1837.2s)]
*  What kind of drugs? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1842.2s)]
*  Presumably amphetamines. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1843.2s)]
*  OK. You know, at all. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1844.2s)]
*  Some version of that. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1845.2s)]
*  And so who watched it and over a series of days and told me all about it. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1846.2s)]
*  So that's absolutely real. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1850.2s)]
*  And we've never gotten a readout on what drugs he's taking. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1852.2s)]
*  By the way, he's the president of the United States. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1854.2s)]
*  He is a nuclear arsenal at his command. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1856.2s)]
*  He has the briefcase. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1858.2s)]
*  I mean, he should be required to disclose what drugs he's taking. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1861.2s)]
*  No. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1863.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we would want to know, but you know, that's never going to happen. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1864.2s)]
*  I mean, that's never going to happen. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1867.2s)]
*  Who's in control of the government? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1869.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1870.2s)]
*  He's our employee. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1871.2s)]
*  If your housekeeper shows up and she seems drunk, you get to say, are you drunk? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1872.2s)]
*  Prove you're not drunk or go home. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1877.2s)]
*  How much do you love America? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1879.2s)]
*  A lot. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1881.2s)]
*  What is America to you? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1882.2s)]
*  America is the country that we live in. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1883.2s)]
*  America is the country that we live in. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1885.2s)]
*  That is not what is America to you. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1887.2s)]
*  America is my family, my neighbors, my ancestors. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1889.2s)]
*  America is the grandchildren. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1893.2s)]
*  I don't yet have America, is also a physical place. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1896.2s)]
*  It's the water. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1899.2s)]
*  It's the trees, especially. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1900.2s)]
*  It's the mountains. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1902.2s)]
*  It's the coasts. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1903.2s)]
*  It's the physical beauty of the country. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1904.2s)]
*  It's a physical place to me. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1905.2s)]
*  It is absolutely not an idea. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1907.2s)]
*  I don't even know what that means. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1908.2s)]
*  And it's a physical reality to me. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1910.2s)]
*  America has a smell. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1912.2s)]
*  America has a vibe. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1914.2s)]
*  and America is Americans. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1915.2s)]
*  And so it's the people who live here. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1917.44s)]
*  By the way, if America is filled with people [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1918.5s)]
*  who aren't American, it's no longer America. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1920.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's what's happening, of course. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1921.72s)]
*  It was not the country I grew up in, therefore it's not, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1923.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, what's my attachment to the country? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1925.76s)]
*  A place is the people who occupy the place [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1928.76s)]
*  and it's the physical surroundings. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1931.48s)]
*  We're in a room, we're in a barn right now. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1932.56s)]
*  And it's, you know, the wood beams holding up the hayloft, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1934.76s)]
*  but it's also you and your wife, one of my, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1938.14s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1940.72s)]
*  So it's real things that you can touch and smell [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1941.56s)]
*  and taste. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1944.92s)]
*  It's not, there's nothing abstract about it. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1946.5600000000002s)]
*  Just like there's nothing abstract about my wife. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1948.3400000000001s)]
*  Like I like the way she smells, right? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1950.16s)]
*  She's not an idea. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1953.24s)]
*  Is your wife an idea? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1954.24s)]
*  No. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1955.68s)]
*  She's a physical presence. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1956.52s)]
*  Right, so that's what America is to me, yes. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1959.72s)]
*  So, and how worried are you about that America [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1962.0800000000002s)]
*  being at risk or collapsing or losing some of its mock seed [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1966.74s)]
*  that it's had for two and a half centuries? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1971.52s)]
*  How worried are you about that? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1973.58s)]
*  Well, I've accepted the reality, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1975.22s)]
*  at least in the second part of your question, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1976.6599999999999s)]
*  that it's already happened. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1978.26s)]
*  It's lost its moxie and men are in terminal decline. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1979.1999999999998s)]
*  And I see it all around me, particularly young men. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1984.74s)]
*  They're defeated. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1987.1599999999999s)]
*  They're defeated by a system that set out [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1988.0s)]
*  to defeat them and succeeded. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1989.4199999999998s)]
*  And there are a lot of reasons for that, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1991.54s)]
*  but in a lot of ways that they were defeated, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1993.8999999999999s)]
*  but they have been. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1996.3999999999999s)]
*  Not all, but the broad middle has been defeated. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=1997.46s)]
*  And so I'm incredibly sad about that. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2001.28s)]
*  But I think about America the way that I think about, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2003.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, a ship that's leaking. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2007.72s)]
*  It's like, one thing I know is I'm staying on it, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2009.36s)]
*  whether I'll ride it to the bottom or not, but I'm here. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2011.28s)]
*  So, okay, so at what capacity [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2014.72s)]
*  are you willing to contribute for it not to leak? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2017.6399999999999s)]
*  Is it at any capacity or is it limited capacity [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2020.5s)]
*  that you're willing to personally contribute? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2023.7s)]
*  Well, I don't have any options. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2024.54s)]
*  And by the way, if I were in charge, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2025.96s)]
*  if I were some sort of benign monarch, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2028.12s)]
*  hopefully benign, no dual passports in my country, sorry. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2030.34s)]
*  I mean, because that really is the measure of commitment. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2035.62s)]
*  You know, are you all in or not? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2039.1799999999998s)]
*  Like, do you have options? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2040.74s)]
*  You know, have you burned the boats, as they say? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2042.58s)]
*  And I think you should be required to burn the boats. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2044.9399999999998s)]
*  No, you can't go back. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2046.6399999999999s)]
*  What, you're here. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2048.22s)]
*  And once you are, this is what marriage is. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2049.64s)]
*  This is why you treat your wife better [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2052.06s)]
*  than you treat your girlfriend [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2053.2599999999998s)]
*  because you're married to her [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2054.1s)]
*  and it's very hard to get out of [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2055.7s)]
*  and you've got children together. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2057.34s)]
*  And so in a normal marriage, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2058.5s)]
*  the person's like, well, one thing I know I'm not doing [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2060.02s)]
*  is divorcing. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2061.62s)]
*  So I'm gonna actually try, I'm gonna suck it up and try. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2062.9s)]
*  And that works, sucking it up and trying works. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2065.86s)]
*  I feel the same way about my country. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2068.58s)]
*  I'm not going anywhere. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2069.74s)]
*  I don't have another passport. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2070.7s)]
*  I wouldn't get another passport. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2071.74s)]
*  How many people do I know with dual passports? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2073.2599999999998s)]
*  Like a million? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2074.6s)]
*  And they tend to be the richest people [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2076.02s)]
*  and the people who've gotten the most from the country, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2078.18s)]
*  who've really benefited from our systems, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2080.22s)]
*  which they've then destroyed. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2081.82s)]
*  And I think that should be illegal. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2083.38s)]
*  Like pick a country and pick a military. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2085.0s)]
*  No, you can't serve in a foreign military, what? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2087.18s)]
*  And no, we're not gonna pay you to serve in a foreign. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2090.4599999999996s)]
*  I don't care what the country, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2091.54s)]
*  I don't care if it's England or Sweden [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2092.8199999999997s)]
*  where my answers just came from. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2094.54s)]
*  I don't care if it's Burkina Faso where yours came from [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2095.5s)]
*  or Iran where yours came from. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2097.3799999999997s)]
*  It's like, no. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2098.74s)]
*  And you should be all in. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2100.2599999999998s)]
*  Just the whole idea of it, it's like an Airbnb. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2103.8999999999996s)]
*  They're using, the country's like a fucking Airbnb to them. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2106.3799999999997s)]
*  And it's not an Airbnb, it's my house. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2109.74s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2111.7s)]
*  Okay, so let's stay on that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2112.58s)]
*  When, when? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2113.74s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2115.02s)]
*  No, this is very helpful. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2115.8599999999997s)]
*  Serving in a foreign military. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2118.3s)]
*  When, you talking about the- [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2120.0600000000004s)]
*  Any military, I mean any foreign military. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2121.5800000000004s)]
*  But I know what you're talking about [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2122.82s)]
*  because I read the notes on if you're able to serve [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2124.0600000000004s)]
*  in Israel, it's gonna count as- [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2127.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh, you hate Israel. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2128.9s)]
*  Service all this stuff, yeah. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2129.7400000000002s)]
*  I do not hate, I like Israel. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2130.5600000000004s)]
*  But what is a, I don't even wanna get sidetracked. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2132.0600000000004s)]
*  How is that even the logic to say like, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2134.02s)]
*  you serve in another military, counts as the same as- [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2135.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't care, I don't care if it's, my name is Carlson. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2137.78s)]
*  But no, but what's the- [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2140.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm Swedish, if you serve in the Swedish military, get out. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2140.9s)]
*  What's the argument? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2143.1800000000003s)]
*  We're not Sweden. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2144.02s)]
*  I mean, what? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2144.86s)]
*  How is there argument to us though? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2146.1000000000004s)]
*  How are they saying that- [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2147.78s)]
*  There's no argument. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2148.6200000000003s)]
*  There's just like, you hate this or that. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2149.46s)]
*  No, I don't hate anybody. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2151.5800000000004s)]
*  And actually in the case of that specific country, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2153.1800000000003s)]
*  I've been there a number of times. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2155.5s)]
*  I could describe it in detail [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2157.5s)]
*  because it's one of my favorite places in the world. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2159.02s)]
*  I'm just saying, I do. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2160.26s)]
*  Not just the ancient city that defines the country, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2161.6200000000003s)]
*  in my opinion, not the modern Miami knockoff [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2165.42s)]
*  that everyone loves, but the real Jerusalem. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2167.5600000000004s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2170.1800000000003s)]
*  And the people and the food and like, I just like it. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2171.1000000000004s)]
*  So I'm not gonna fall for that. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2173.6800000000003s)]
*  You hate it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2175.6600000000003s)]
*  No, I don't hate it. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2176.5s)]
*  I just love my country. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2177.8s)]
*  And I think you can only have one country at a time. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2178.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't believe in polygamy either. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2180.28s)]
*  You got one wife. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2181.76s)]
*  And by the way, if you have two wives, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2182.84s)]
*  I know people who are polygamists and I, you know, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2184.0s)]
*  with respect, you're not all in on any one wife. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2185.76s)]
*  So it's like, well, she's acting crazy. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2189.7200000000003s)]
*  See ya. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2192.52s)]
*  And you go deal with the other wife, right? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2193.44s)]
*  And your commitment is less when it's diffuse. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2194.8s)]
*  When you've got more than one, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2198.04s)]
*  you cannot serve two masters. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2198.88s)]
*  I believe I'm quoting someone in that. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2200.92s)]
*  And it's just true. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2202.1600000000003s)]
*  It's factually true. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2203.0s)]
*  Well, if you got four wives and you run a good podcast, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2204.1200000000003s)]
*  you immediately have a couple sponsors, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2206.24s)]
*  Cialis, Tiago, it's like, hey, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2208.0s)]
*  I'm here with my four wives. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2209.64s)]
*  This is brought to you by- [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2211.9599999999996s)]
*  Do you know anyone who's polygamist? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2212.7999999999997s)]
*  Have you known polygamist people? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2214.2s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2215.16s)]
*  I had a guy that came, interviewed for a job, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2216.2799999999997s)]
*  and he came from Africa and he had 32 kids. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2219.4399999999996s)]
*  I said, how do you have, I'd love to have 20 kids. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2221.9599999999996s)]
*  I would too, I would. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2223.7599999999998s)]
*  But he's got eight wives. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2225.4399999999996s)]
*  So mathematically, math is in his favor. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2226.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2227.8799999999997s)]
*  Is he Muslim? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2228.72s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2230.56s)]
*  Because that's doubly allowed amount. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2231.3999999999996s)]
*  The problem with polygamy in Islam, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2233.24s)]
*  which is actually a lot more, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2237.14s)]
*  I'm not flacking for Islam, I'm a Christian, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2239.24s)]
*  but it's a lot more humane than people say [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2240.7999999999997s)]
*  and a lot less common than people imagine [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2243.7999999999997s)]
*  because the rules are pretty tough on polygamy in Islam. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2246.4799999999996s)]
*  You have to treat each wife the same. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2249.4399999999996s)]
*  And that means spend the same amount of money, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2250.64s)]
*  spend the same amount of time. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2252.12s)]
*  So if you take one wife to Disney World with her kids, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2253.6s)]
*  you gotta take the next wife to Disney World with her kids [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2257.0s)]
*  for the same amount of time. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2259.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, it takes a lot of money [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2261.0s)]
*  and a lot of effort to make it right. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2262.3999999999996s)]
*  Are you suggesting for term limits in marriage? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2264.44s)]
*  Like is that kind of what you're saying? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2266.56s)]
*  I'm suggesting actually that monogamy works really well. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2268.3999999999996s)]
*  I should stick with it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2271.44s)]
*  But- [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2272.7599999999998s)]
*  Specify because sometimes, you know, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2273.64s)]
*  there could be a gray area. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2275.12s)]
*  But let me go to my question. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2276.04s)]
*  So obviously this is the first time you and I have ever met. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2277.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2280.48s)]
*  The last 24 hours. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2281.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, we had dinner last night. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2282.14s)]
*  Of course, but what I'm saying is [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2282.98s)]
*  we've never met prior to this. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2283.8199999999997s)]
*  We've never spoken. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2284.66s)]
*  This is the first interaction we've had the last 24 hours. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2285.72s)]
*  Great time last night. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2289.08s)]
*  That was the real podcast. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2291.08s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2292.7599999999998s)]
*  That was the real podcast. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2293.6s)]
*  But anyways, we won't go there. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2296.84s)]
*  But the conversation, the question I got for you [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2298.36s)]
*  is when I was watching you and I'm trying to see, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2300.6s)]
*  you know, the evolution of you [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2304.72s)]
*  from where you're at, your background, what you've done, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2307.56s)]
*  sitting there saying, okay, is this, oh, he's leaving [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2309.9s)]
*  because he's gonna build News Corp too [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2312.8s)]
*  because he wants to be the next, you know, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2315.84s)]
*  Rupert Murdoch. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2318.76s)]
*  Like, I don't know if that's what he wants to do. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2319.88s)]
*  He's gonna be Roger Ailes [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2321.44s)]
*  and he's gonna produce a hundred other talents. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2323.28s)]
*  Maybe, I don't know. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2326.52s)]
*  No, no, he wants to be the Rush Limbaugh, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2327.82s)]
*  you know, the number one for the next two decades. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2331.04s)]
*  And he wants to be able to say, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2333.8s)]
*  so okay, he's already that guy. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2335.44s)]
*  I don't think he needs to do that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2336.92s)]
*  No, then there's a part of me that says, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2338.04s)]
*  okay, I really think this guy loves America [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2340.0s)]
*  in a very sincere, clear conviction type of way, okay? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2343.12s)]
*  And I think he's willing to do anything for that. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2347.24s)]
*  This is not a conversation for 2024. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2349.96s)]
*  Do you at all like internally think, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2352.96s)]
*  and you know, you're a very well-read guy. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2355.0s)]
*  There's books here, there's plenty of books over there. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2356.84s)]
*  Do you look at Churchill and you say, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2360.08s)]
*  this guy was a journalist, controversial figure, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2361.7999999999997s)]
*  the feud with him in Chamberlain and all these other guys [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2365.22s)]
*  and eventually he's like, listen, man, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2367.4s)]
*  we're gonna need someone like this [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2368.98s)]
*  that's got the brass to come and do something. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2369.92s)]
*  Is there any limit of where you're willing to go [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2372.5600000000004s)]
*  to fight for what America, the idea of America, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2375.5600000000004s)]
*  where you grew up, your story, your family, all of that, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2380.0800000000004s)]
*  are you willing to go all the way to the point [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2382.2400000000002s)]
*  where you would consider a 2028 run as a president? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2383.8s)]
*  Well, I believe in using the gifts that God gave you. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2387.4s)]
*  And I think putting people in the wrong jobs [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2391.5600000000004s)]
*  or the wrong marriages or the wrong schools [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2394.1200000000003s)]
*  is counterproductive, in fact, it's a sin. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2396.44s)]
*  I think we're all born for something [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2398.92s)]
*  and you should figure out what that is and you should do it. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2400.4s)]
*  My dogs, two of my dogs can find any bird on any path [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2402.6800000000003s)]
*  in any field or forest in America, they will find the bird. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2409.0s)]
*  They do not do my taxes [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2411.88s)]
*  because they're not born to do my taxes, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2413.04s)]
*  they're born to find birds. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2414.4s)]
*  And I feel the way about myself and everyone around me, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2415.92s)]
*  do what you're born to do. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2418.1600000000003s)]
*  And I just don't see myself as a political person. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2419.1800000000003s)]
*  My only goal is to be free, personally free. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2421.1800000000003s)]
*  I really believe in personal liberation, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2424.52s)]
*  like tell the truth, that's liberation, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2426.36s)]
*  about yourself primarily. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2428.4s)]
*  But also about the world around you. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2430.24s)]
*  And my second goal is to preserve the country [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2431.9599999999996s)]
*  that I grew up in to the extent that I can. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2436.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, recognizing that my powers are really limited [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2437.8799999999997s)]
*  and that my vision is blurry and I'm a human being, not God. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2440.6s)]
*  But yeah, that's absolutely my goal. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2445.64s)]
*  I've never been that interested in money at all [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  and I'm not interested in building large organizations [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2450.7799999999997s)]
*  or administering them, I'm not good at that. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2454.2799999999997s)]
*  And I just wanna tell the truth [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2456.64s)]
*  and I'm absolutely willing, especially now that I'm 55, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2459.1s)]
*  like who cares? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2462.74s)]
*  You're looking at a future of what, like Parkinson's? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2464.54s)]
*  Like really? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2466.86s)]
*  At a certain age, you're like, what do you, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2467.7s)]
*  I see these old people, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2470.94s)]
*  including a lot of old people in power [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2472.18s)]
*  who were like trying to squeeze out another year. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2473.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like, accept your mortality, please. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2475.74s)]
*  Spend some time with the people you love [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2480.9s)]
*  and who love you, your children, your grandchildren, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2483.62s)]
*  your wife. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2485.42s)]
*  None of them wanna accept the finite nature of life. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2486.36s)]
*  So I do accept that. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2489.1200000000003s)]
*  And so I just wanna do whatever I can [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2490.44s)]
*  to achieve those two goals, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2493.44s)]
*  to remain free and honest inside [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2494.6400000000003s)]
*  and to preserve the country that I really love. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2497.2000000000003s)]
*  Like I loved growing up here [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2499.28s)]
*  and so have previous generations in my family [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2501.08s)]
*  and I hope subsequent generations. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2504.76s)]
*  So that's kind of it. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2506.02s)]
*  I have always had low-bore goals. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2507.04s)]
*  I don't have any grand plan for world domination. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2508.7200000000003s)]
*  I can't even dominate my town, you know? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2511.88s)]
*  But I would do anything to do that. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2514.28s)]
*  Anything. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2517.5600000000004s)]
*  Anything. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2518.4s)]
*  So you would consider 2028 run? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2519.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think I'd be very good at it, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2520.7200000000003s)]
*  but I would do whatever I could to help. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2522.0400000000004s)]
*  I want to be helpful. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2524.6400000000003s)]
*  And that is the motto of my family actually. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2526.32s)]
*  Inside my wedding ring, it says forever your helper. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2528.1200000000003s)]
*  And my wife says that too, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2532.44s)]
*  because I believe in helping. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2533.7200000000003s)]
*  I think that's our duty as Christians. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2534.7200000000003s)]
*  It's our duty as people. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2536.52s)]
*  It's the most fulfilling thing you can do [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2537.92s)]
*  is just to help in some small way. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2539.38s)]
*  You're never gonna figure it out. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2541.0800000000004s)]
*  You're never gonna fix everything [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2542.0800000000004s)]
*  because you're not God. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2543.76s)]
*  To repeat, you're not God. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2545.1600000000003s)]
*  But you can make incremental progress [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2546.1600000000003s)]
*  and you should never stop trying. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2549.0600000000004s)]
*  So I would, I mean, would you? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2550.28s)]
*  Oh, no question about it. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2552.5600000000004s)]
*  This country's changed my life. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2554.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's, absolutely. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2555.7200000000003s)]
*  But do you think there's a political, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2559.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is such a cliche at this point, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2560.5200000000004s)]
*  but is there a political solution [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2562.2000000000003s)]
*  to the problems that beset us? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2564.6400000000003s)]
*  What are you gonna do if you're not involved? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2567.48s)]
*  How are you gonna be able to make direct input? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2569.44s)]
*  You can talk about all this stuff all you want. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2571.0s)]
*  If you're not on the inside to see what's really going on, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2573.16s)]
*  then what are you gonna do? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2575.2s)]
*  Because I think articulating things out loud [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2576.08s)]
*  makes all the difference. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2579.56s)]
*  Policy change. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2581.92s)]
*  Policy change, for sure, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2583.2s)]
*  but those typically follow changes of heart. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2585.0s)]
*  I mean, there's some policies that nobody wants [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2587.68s)]
*  and they change everything [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2589.3599999999997s)]
*  because they're imposed by fiat, that's real. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2590.3999999999996s)]
*  On the other hand, look at what triggers the liars. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2592.58s)]
*  It's not policy changes. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2597.14s)]
*  It's some guy standing up and saying, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2598.56s)]
*  wait, that's not true. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2600.64s)]
*  The CIA knew about Oswald, like shut up, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2602.2s)]
*  it's like, or whatever it is. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2606.24s)]
*  Why don't you declassify the 9-11 document? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2607.96s)]
*  Shut up, conspiracy theorist. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2609.56s)]
*  It's like, why is that so threatening? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2611.4399999999996s)]
*  And it's so threatening [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2613.8999999999996s)]
*  because it's getting closer to the truth. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2614.74s)]
*  So saying the truth out loud, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2617.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, they spend all of their time [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2619.2999999999997s)]
*  trying to censor people. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2620.64s)]
*  Why do they do that? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2621.6s)]
*  Because that's the greatest threat to them. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2622.4399999999996s)]
*  It's not some bill in Congress, that can be undone. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2624.4399999999996s)]
*  What can't be undone, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2626.64s)]
*  if you get in an argument with your wife [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2627.74s)]
*  and you say something truly horrible to her, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2629.56s)]
*  like vicious and true. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2632.0800000000004s)]
*  Kind of hard to fix that. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2635.2000000000003s)]
*  Like it'd be many years before you fix that [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2636.2000000000003s)]
*  because you've articulated something, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2638.4s)]
*  those words have hung in the air [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2640.78s)]
*  as a kind of independent entity, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2642.36s)]
*  like words have their own being. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2644.0800000000004s)]
*  In the beginning was the word. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2647.7200000000003s)]
*  And that does more damage than punching somebody, it's true. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2648.8s)]
*  So I don't know, I think telling the truth out loud [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2655.1600000000003s)]
*  is like the most powerful [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2659.12s)]
*  and revolutionary thing that you can do. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2661.2s)]
*  Yeah, but you need, so what'll happen is, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2664.16s)]
*  here's what I noticed that's going on. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2666.4s)]
*  So we're at a family Goldman Sachs event [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2669.24s)]
*  in Chicago last week. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2672.24s)]
*  And they bring these 60 billionaire families. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2674.2s)]
*  And it's about family, family forum, family, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2677.3199999999997s)]
*  founder family forum, something like that, right? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2681.52s)]
*  It was actually a very interesting thing to go [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2683.44s)]
*  because it's generational wealth [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2685.3199999999997s)]
*  to see how other families have done it. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2687.48s)]
*  So you saw all the owners of the different sports teams, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2688.96s)]
*  Reinsdorf, they own the Bulls, you got the Cubs, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2691.36s)]
*  you got the Blackhawks, you got the Crown family, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2693.96s)]
*  General Dynamics, 30 billion dollar family, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2696.76s)]
*  and they're kind of going through it. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2698.72s)]
*  And then you have the Walsh family, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2700.08s)]
*  very, very interesting to listen to these guys. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2701.38s)]
*  One of the parts when they're, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2704.48s)]
*  the Crown family guy Keating is talking, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2706.68s)]
*  he says, in our family, I'm fourth generation, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2709.76s)]
*  I'm the oldest G4, and G4 means fourth generation kid. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2715.1200000000003s)]
*  He's a 47 year old G4, okay? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2720.1200000000003s)]
*  His daughter is a 12 year old who's the oldest G5 at a 150. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2724.6000000000004s)]
*  Okay, so you got a oldest G4, oldest G5. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2731.32s)]
*  Now G5 is 150 kids, grandkids. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2733.88s)]
*  So imagine 150 kids that are coming from a billionaire [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2738.36s)]
*  family are like, how much of that is coming to me? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2740.48s)]
*  It's kind of complicated to how to use that, right? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2743.32s)]
*  Okay, so watch this. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2746.2400000000002s)]
*  So then the next guy comes up [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2747.76s)]
*  and is breaking down the numbers saying, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2749.6400000000003s)]
*  do you know what percentage of wealthy family's money [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2751.0s)]
*  makes it to second generation G2? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2753.7400000000002s)]
*  31%. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2755.6800000000003s)]
*  Do you know what percentage makes it to G3? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2757.08s)]
*  12%. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2758.96s)]
*  Do you know what percentage makes it to G4? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2760.08s)]
*  3%. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2761.92s)]
*  So wow, 31, 12, 3 to G4, what is it to G5, G6, G7? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2763.36s)]
*  Okay, so where am I going with this? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2770.76s)]
*  America is a family, is a company, right? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2773.6800000000003s)]
*  And it started off with the wealth that's been created [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2777.96s)]
*  and now we got G1, G2, G3, G4, whatever it is today, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2781.2400000000002s)]
*  G20, G30, G40, we're on a different G, right? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2784.0800000000004s)]
*  And except now it's like a super wealthy family. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2787.5800000000004s)]
*  Let's put a net worth of $32 trillion or $30 trillion [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2793.1600000000003s)]
*  minus all the credit card debt that we have [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2796.6400000000003s)]
*  that's another $32 trillion and we got a top line revenue [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2798.44s)]
*  of say $4 trillion, whatever our GDP that we're doing [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2801.52s)]
*  per year, no problem. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2804.16s)]
*  So you break this down and you're trying to get that money, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2805.72s)]
*  it was like, hey, what am I gonna get? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2809.28s)]
*  How'd you forget about me? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2811.72s)]
*  I did this, you owe me this much money. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2813.42s)]
*  Oh shit, we gotta make this guy, we gotta make that guy, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2815.12s)]
*  we gotta make this guy. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2816.92s)]
*  The way it's going, it's catastrophic on what's gonna happen [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2817.88s)]
*  money wise here very soon with the next generation [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2822.28s)]
*  that are entitled on what you're gonna give to them next. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2825.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2827.36s)]
*  So many times, just like when you look at people [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2829.18s)]
*  that should have more kids, don't, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2833.66s)]
*  the people that don't have the resources [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2836.58s)]

*  kids and so we're duplicating the wrong habits [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2845.18s)]
*  at a pace faster than duplicating the right habits. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2848.8199999999997s)]
*  Eventually what ends up happening is people [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2852.54s)]
*  that are not qualified to run a job do so [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2854.3399999999997s)]

*  I think it was Plato that said it. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2858.88s)]
*  I've noticed. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2860.32s)]
*  Those who think it's foolish to study politics [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2861.16s)]
*  will be governed by fools who do. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2865.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2868.86s)]
*  Those who think it's foolish to study politics [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2869.7000000000003s)]
*  will be governed by fools who do. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2871.68s)]
*  Okay, if guys who have the mouthpiece, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2872.92s)]
*  debate, history, argument, if those guys [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2877.2000000000003s)]
*  who should consider running don't run, fools will [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2880.48s)]

*  It's the story of Kamal Harris. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2884.68s)]
*  When I was a child, I got my first driver's license [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2886.7999999999997s)]
*  in 1985 or something-ish, 1985. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2889.04s)]
*  Kamal Harris would be working at the DMV [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2893.08s)]
*  and you'd think how did someone like this [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2895.08s)]
*  get a job at the DMV? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2896.72s)]
*  She's dumb, she's annoying, she clearly hates me [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2897.9199999999996s)]
*  for reasons I can't control and then you wake up [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2901.52s)]
*  in a country where she's a US Senator [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2904.9599999999996s)]
*  then Vice President of the United States. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2906.3199999999997s)]
*  It's like no, I completely agree with you. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2907.6s)]
*  The problem is it's hard to fix that. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2910.3999999999996s)]
*  The generational, I mean I actually grew up [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2912.9799999999996s)]
*  in a family like this, G5 or whatever [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2915.56s)]
*  and you look around and everybody's not impressive [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2918.32s)]
*  and self-hating and not productive [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2921.72s)]
*  and increasingly not rich at all and drinking too much [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2924.88s)]
*  and decadent and filled with all kinds of angst [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2928.64s)]
*  and all that. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2932.56s)]
*  Generational wealth does not. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2933.74s)]
*  I've almost never seen it work. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2935.18s)]
*  So what's the answer to that? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2937.36s)]
*  Well, I don't think the answer is sitting on the sidelines [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2940.32s)]
*  and having them keep getting more and more power. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2942.44s)]
*  You just described the problem of the country. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2944.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2947.12s)]
*  I'm not attacking the Crown family [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2947.96s)]
*  or the Goldman Sachs family so I wonder how screwed up [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2949.1600000000003s)]
*  the G5 is in all those families, pretty screwed up. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2952.12s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2954.28s)]
*  Like big time. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2955.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh and no question about it. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2956.0s)]
*  So what happens in families happens at scale, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2957.36s)]
*  it happens in countries. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2959.2400000000002s)]
*  For sure but also at the same time, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2960.08s)]
*  when you go and study Lawrence Miller's book, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2962.0s)]
*  Barbarians to Bureaucrats, he talks about every civilization, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2966.2400000000002s)]
*  every society, every country, company [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2968.6800000000003s)]
*  goes through these phases. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2970.88s)]
*  First you have the profit, he's the founder. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2972.0s)]
*  You have the founding fathers. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2973.6s)]
*  Hey, we're gonna go out there and there's no way [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2975.2799999999997s)]
*  we're gonna pay taxes on taxation without representation. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2976.92s)]
*  Shit, okay, these guys are not wanting to pay taxes. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2980.04s)]
*  Yeah, they can't do that to us. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2982.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2984.2799999999997s)]
*  Then they inspire barbarians. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2985.2799999999997s)]
*  So Jobs inspired barbarians. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2990.2799999999997s)]
*  Musk inspires barbarians. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2992.64s)]
*  Sometimes the profit is a barbarian. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2994.48s)]
*  Musk is both. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2996.8399999999997s)]
*  Jobs is both. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2998.48s)]
*  Our founding fathers, many of them were both. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=2999.68s)]
*  So you got profit, barbarian, builders, explorers, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3002.04s)]
*  then you have administrators. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3007.24s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3009.12s)]
*  Then you have aristocrats, bureaucrats. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3009.96s)]
*  Then comes the downfall. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3012.2s)]
*  Company, family, legacy, G4, G5, it's done. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3013.68s)]
*  And the only way at this point that you can save [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3018.7599999999998s)]
*  that civilization, that society, that company [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3020.6s)]
*  is for a synergist that comes in [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3023.2s)]
*  and is able to rally enough of the people [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3026.12s)]
*  to say here's what we're gonna be doing. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3028.52s)]
*  He's not trying to rally the aristocrats. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3030.2799999999997s)]
*  He's not trying to rally the bureaucrats. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3032.04s)]
*  You're not gonna get those guys. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3033.52s)]
*  Those guys gotta get fired. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3034.4399999999996s)]
*  He's trying to rally the builders, the explorers, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3036.08s)]
*  the guys that are saying hey man, I just wanna kinda go out [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3038.3199999999997s)]
*  and build my business. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3040.16s)]
*  I feel we're at an era right now, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3042.3999999999996s)]
*  we're at a phase right now where the synergists [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3044.3999999999996s)]
*  need to say you know what, I feel like I can play [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3047.64s)]
*  the role for this, great, let's roll. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3049.7999999999997s)]
*  I think these guys need to right now either be recruited, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3053.0s)]
*  they need to be inspired, they need to have people [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3057.9599999999996s)]
*  that come to them and have a conversation saying hey, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3061.16s)]
*  I think you need to consider, we got five of us here, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3062.64s)]
*  we came here for one reason. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3064.8799999999997s)]
*  We're thinking about talking to you about 2028. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3066.0s)]
*  Not interested, not this, not, not seeing these conversations [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3068.24s)]
*  are not happening, of course they're happening [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3070.64s)]
*  behind closed doors regularly. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3071.9199999999996s)]
*  But I think these guys, if America's worth saving, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3073.7999999999997s)]
*  if the concept of saving America is something that we value, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3078.48s)]
*  we need to either choose if we can, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3082.7999999999997s)]
*  contribute kinda like you, or we need to inspire [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3085.3199999999997s)]
*  and recruit and get others to say I think you ought [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3088.48s)]
*  to consider doing this. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3091.12s)]
*  I mean I think you need a whole class of people. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3092.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean I feel like I'm unusual, statistically unusual [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3094.88s)]
*  in that I'm a white American born man [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3098.64s)]
*  who's not like suicidal on some level. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3100.96s)]
*  I don't think there's a virtue in destroying things [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3103.0s)]
*  including myself. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3104.6s)]
*  Not just not into it, I just don't feel that way at all. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3105.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm sort of, you know what I mean, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3108.7200000000003s)]
*  have a lot to appreciate in everything and I love my family. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3110.7200000000003s)]
*  But there aren't that many people like that [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3114.64s)]
*  and it is the product of generational wealth. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3117.84s)]
*  I mean there are a lot, but statistically there are [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3121.04s)]
*  a lot of people who, I mean what's transgenderism? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3123.1600000000003s)]
*  It's a form of suicide, of course. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3128.84s)]
*  What's drug addiction, a form of suicide? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3130.8s)]
*  What's chronic obesity, form of suicide? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3132.6400000000003s)]
*  It's all kind of branches from the same tree. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3135.1600000000003s)]
*  And so it's really about the spirit and that's why [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3138.6400000000003s)]
*  if you did immigration right, which we're not doing at all, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3142.08s)]
*  we're using immigration as another tool [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3144.92s)]
*  to destroy the country. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3146.52s)]
*  But you could conceivably add the energy [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3147.36s)]
*  and the non-suicidal impulses into your country, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3152.52s)]
*  your gene pool, that would be good. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3155.0s)]
*  But I don't kind of see a way out. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3158.72s)]
*  Like the people who were born in 1969 as I was, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3160.72s)]
*  just a lot of them have just given up. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3165.08s)]
*  So what would you say as an employer [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3167.12s)]
*  and as an immigrant who made it here, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3170.48s)]
*  what would you say to a 22-year-old man [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3172.28s)]
*  who can't get a job? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3174.28s)]
*  Go to some stupid college, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3175.8s)]
*  get some meaningless marketing degree [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3176.92s)]

*  We're sitting here last night. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3210.68s)]
*  Who learned the most? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3212.04s)]
*  The guys that were here that are watching, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3213.08s)]
*  the exchange, the questioning, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3214.48s)]
*  hey, what do you think about this, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3215.8399999999997s)]
*  what about that? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3216.68s)]
*  Going back and forth to somebody that's 22 years old. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3217.64s)]
*  Yesterday was six months worth of media lessons last night, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3219.96s)]
*  what we just went through. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3223.44s)]
*  Think about what that happened those three hours last night. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3224.36s)]
*  What would a 22-year-old gain from that? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3227.7999999999997s)]
*  What would you and I gain at 22 if we were at that room? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3229.52s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, it's crazy. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3232.12s)]
*  God, did this make sense? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3234.2s)]
*  So I think to me it's more go find the right people [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3235.52s)]
*  to duplicate and shadow and support them. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3239.9199999999996s)]
*  And if you can work under them as closely as possible, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3242.3599999999997s)]
*  that'd be a better degree for you than anything else. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3245.3999999999996s)]
*  But let me go back to kind of what you were saying, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3247.56s)]
*  saying I'm 55 years old. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3248.9199999999996s)]
*  The guys that were born in 1969, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3250.56s)]

*  But that's, they've given up. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3254.16s)]
*  But that's exactly what they want you to do. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3255.2s)]
*  That's exactly what you. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3257.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3258.64s)]
*  No, not you, meaning that's exactly what, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3259.46s)]
*  if the person's wanting, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3260.8399999999997s)]
*  that's exactly what they want you to do. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3261.68s)]
*  They want you to be sitting there saying, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3262.92s)]
*  yeah, I mean, what can I do? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3264.96s)]
*  You know, I'm just like, I can't do anything about it. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3266.56s)]
*  In every organization, in every great movie, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3269.0s)]
*  every great story, every great book, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3272.64s)]
*  the hero's journey you go through, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3275.16s)]
*  it's typically the guy that doesn't want to do it. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3277.52s)]
*  People are trying to encourage him. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3280.76s)]
*  And then finally one day clicks, boom. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3282.2400000000002s)]
*  And then, boom, you know, something happens. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3285.08s)]
*  Spirit opens up, they go in intentional, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3288.16s)]
*  they're trying to get a certain level of conviction [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3290.52s)]
*  deep down inside where you're saying, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3291.56s)]
*  there's something different about the way this guy's [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3293.56s)]
*  selling it to me than others. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3295.08s)]
*  I don't know why I like this guy. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3296.16s)]
*  I trust this guy. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3297.6s)]
*  He seems reasonable. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3298.88s)]
*  I can listen to this guy. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3299.96s)]
*  I think those guys are out there. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3301.5s)]
*  And the idea years ago, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3304.52s)]
*  you know, they asked Castro, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3308.92s)]
*  say, hey, if you had to do it all over again, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3310.48s)]
*  how many thousands of people would you need [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3312.34s)]
*  to be able to pursue your vision of communism [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3314.26s)]
*  and all this other, would it be 10,000? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3316.8s)]
*  Would it be 100,000? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3318.64s)]
*  Would it be 1,000? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3319.48s)]
*  He says, I need one person who's a 100% true believer. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3320.52s)]
*  That's all I need. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3325.2799999999997s)]
*  With one, we would have done it all over again, right? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3326.2s)]
*  There's this idea that we think we need 70, 80, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3328.6s)]
*  1,000, 10,000. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3331.56s)]
*  We need one person who we can rally behind. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3333.04s)]
*  And by the way, the other thing I would also say is, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3335.04s)]
*  you know, the founding fathers, 1776, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3337.94s)]
*  they did what they did, Benjamin Rush, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3340.48s)]
*  you got all these guys, Smith, Jefferson, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3342.08s)]
*  you know, Washington, of course, Franklin, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3343.8399999999997s)]
*  all these names, right? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3345.92s)]
*  Where are those guys today who are getting together [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3349.04s)]
*  once a month, once a quarter, once every six months [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3353.3599999999997s)]
*  to talk, where are those guys today? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3355.8399999999997s)]
*  Where are those guys today? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3358.62s)]
*  Do we not need those guys today? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3359.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'm not talking about Congress, Senate, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3361.52s)]
*  I'm talking about guys that can hold those guys accountable. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3363.2799999999997s)]
*  Where are those guys today? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3365.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3367.3199999999997s)]
*  But I think, you know, the great thing [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3368.2799999999997s)]
*  about what's been going on the last four years specifically, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3370.3199999999997s)]
*  maybe start at 16, got pretty bad in COVID, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3373.0s)]
*  2020, 2021, the one thing that's been very weird [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3376.4s)]
*  the last four years, the right people are finding each other. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3380.1200000000003s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3384.04s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3384.88s)]
*  Do you feel the spirit of the country changing? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3385.7000000000003s)]
*  Do you feel the people, well, I have noticed [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3387.1600000000003s)]
*  in my tiny weird little world that people do seem freer [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3389.76s)]
*  about what they say and think. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3393.1600000000003s)]
*  I agree. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3394.96s)]
*  You feel that? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3395.8s)]
*  I fully agree. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3396.6400000000003s)]
*  Absolutely, I agree. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3397.56s)]
*  And by the way, I think a couple of it also, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3398.52s)]
*  we gotta give credit to the right people. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3399.92s)]
*  You gotta give credit to capitalism [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3401.84s)]
*  because I think with Danny elected with Spotify, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3403.28s)]
*  defending Rogan was monumental. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3406.48s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3407.88s)]
*  I think that was a very, very big move on what he did. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3408.7200000000003s)]
*  I think Musk buying Twitter and X monumental. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3411.8s)]
*  If X doesn't do what he does, he fires Rogan. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3415.64s)]
*  If Elon never buys Twitter, this is not the same America. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3418.44s)]
*  So there's been also good moves behind closed doors [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3421.88s)]
*  where people are sitting there and saying, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3425.56s)]
*  okay, all right, shit. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3427.6s)]
*  If we act up and we give strikes for everything [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3429.96s)]
*  and we lose these guys, they got a place to go Spotify [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3433.36s)]
*  and they got a place to go Twitter and X, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3435.68s)]
*  that is problem that we can't lose that guy [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3438.44s)]
*  because if we do, then people are gonna be like, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3440.56s)]
*  this is the censorship crowd. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3442.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, so what do we gotta do to get rid of Elon? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3444.3999999999996s)]
*  A lot of defamation. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3447.3599999999997s)]
*  We gotta find everything and anything we can on him, right? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3448.7999999999997s)]
*  Or what do we gotta do with Spotify? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3451.9199999999996s)]
*  He doesn't give a shit. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3453.9199999999996s)]
*  He's living in a different country. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3454.7599999999998s)]
*  He can't do anything to him. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3455.8399999999997s)]
*  And by the way, Spotify numbers came out right now. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3456.96s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the reports from this morning [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3458.72s)]
*  saying 64% of fans of the podcast they follow [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3460.8399999999997s)]
*  they rely on them for their political views [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3465.52s)]
*  than what they get from mainstream media. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3468.4s)]
*  And their numbers has grown 38%. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3470.44s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3471.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3472.6s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3473.6s)]
*  And by the way, just to show a rare flash of racial pride, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3474.44s)]
*  go Sweden, Danny Lack. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3477.64s)]
*  Go Sweden. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3479.68s)]
*  Go Sweden. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3480.52s)]
*  Sweden hasn't added a lot actually to the world [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3481.36s)]
*  in the last 100 years. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3483.56s)]
*  This is one way. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3484.4s)]
*  This is one thing. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3485.24s)]
*  This is one way, yeah. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3486.08s)]
*  Ever since Saab went out of business, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3486.92s)]
*  I kinda lost faith, but Spotify. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3488.28s)]
*  Beautiful car, yes, very sporty. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3489.68s)]
*  So what is, I'm really struck by so many things. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3491.32s)]
*  That's how I spent my life. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3495.52s)]
*  But one, like how is this shaking out? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3496.48s)]
*  Like there are a lot of conservative media outlets [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3502.16s)]
*  that I sort of took semi-seriously [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3504.2s)]
*  that now I don't take seriously at all. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3506.3199999999997s)]
*  They're obviously fake. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3508.12s)]
*  And the news outlets I worked for for the past 30 years, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3510.4s)]
*  they're either all gone or they're about to be gone. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3513.92s)]
*  NBC News is gonna, they're all going away obviously. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3516.92s)]
*  So how does, what does the landscape look in five years? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3519.8399999999997s)]
*  In the media space? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3523.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3524.4s)]
*  Specific to conservative? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3525.24s)]
*  Just broadly. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3526.4s)]
*  Okay, so cable is dropping, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3527.48s)]
*  but not at the pace people thought. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3531.0s)]
*  What Peacock did, paying $110 million [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3533.68s)]
*  for the Dolphins game against the Chiefs [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3536.84s)]
*  and had 23 million people watching [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3539.7999999999997s)]
*  that they had to pay what, 499 or 999? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3542.36s)]
*  That changed the game with sports. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3544.52s)]
*  So cable's sitting there saying, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3546.4s)]
*  holy shit, what are we gonna do now? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3547.24s)]
*  I think they just signed two NFL games [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3548.4s)]
*  that either Amazon or Netflix, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3550.12s)]
*  one of those guys paid some $100 million, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3552.8s)]
*  $120 million. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3554.84s)]
*  So you're seeing sports make the transition out of cable TV [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3555.6800000000003s)]
*  because cable TV's been saved by three communities. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3559.0s)]
*  You got the Boomers, you got the sports community, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3561.6800000000003s)]
*  and you got Big Pharma. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3564.32s)]
*  You take those three out, there is no cable, it's gone. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3565.6800000000003s)]
*  Big Pharma gets their advertising dollars through there, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3568.92s)]
*  so you need one president to come in and say, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3571.44s)]
*  hey, we're not gonna be one of two like New Zealand [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3573.36s)]
*  allowing you guys to advertise on TV, you're gone. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3576.2000000000003s)]
*  Do it elsewhere, you're not gonna advertise anymore. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3578.7200000000003s)]
*  You know who goes out of business if they do that? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3580.96s)]
*  80% of these guys, if not more. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3582.8s)]
*  Boomers, it's just a matter of time. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3585.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't think that would, just to pause for one second, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3587.28s)]
*  I don't think that would save America, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3589.6s)]
*  but I think it would improve America a lot. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3591.3s)]
*  Tremendously, tremendously. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3593.16s)]
*  Do you take any head drugs? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3595.7200000000003s)]
*  Are you in Xanax or Adderall? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3598.16s)]
*  No, no, but I take. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3599.88s)]
*  Everybody is. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3600.7200000000003s)]
*  You're right, right. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3601.7200000000003s)]
*  And those drugs kill you and destroy your brain, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3603.12s)]
*  and no one ever says anything about it. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3605.32s)]
*  How many people do you know are addicted [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3606.7200000000003s)]
*  to Xanax or Adderall? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3607.84s)]
*  I know a lot, personally. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3608.68s)]
*  I've lost friends over that. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3609.84s)]
*  Me too. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3611.28s)]
*  Personally, a number of them, yeah. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3612.1000000000004s)]
*  So Xanax and Adderall, which are considered [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3613.32s)]
*  totally normal, it's just Xanax and Adderall, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3615.2000000000003s)]
*  that's completely evil. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3617.28s)]
*  I mean, that's meth and physically addictive benzodiazepine. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3618.8s)]
*  I mean, it's really crazy, and I can't remember the last time, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3623.88s)]
*  I remember ever seeing a story, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3626.6200000000003s)]
*  and have you ever seen a story on that? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3627.88s)]
*  The only one you would think about is when Tom Cruise [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3630.0s)]
*  went on Matt Lauer and he pushed the envelope, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3631.84s)]
*  and you know, go on Adam, I don't know if you remember [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3633.6800000000003s)]
*  that where he's saying, why are we taking all these drugs? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3635.1200000000003s)]
*  Do I remember it? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3636.48s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3637.32s)]
*  Yes, I remember. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3638.1600000000003s)]
*  I remember thinking that Tom Cruise, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3639.32s)]
*  saying I don't watch movies, so I was like, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3641.0800000000004s)]
*  Tom Cruise is like an actor, he seems a little effeminate [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3642.56s)]
*  and weird, he's in this cult, Scientology. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3644.96s)]
*  By the end of that, I was like, you know what? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3647.28s)]
*  I don't know Tom Cruise, but I'm kind of pro Tom Cruise, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3649.2000000000003s)]
*  because that guy is telling the truth. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3651.56s)]
*  I don't care if it's because of his weird religion [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3652.76s)]
*  or whatever, that's the truth. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3654.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, that was fascinating, right? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3655.44s)]
*  Or even when Robert De Niro, when he's at a film festival [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3658.52s)]
*  and a documentary was coming out about vaccine, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3666.0800000000004s)]
*  I think, Del Big Tree, and he's talking about the documentary [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3668.8s)]
*  because he's got an autistic son, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3671.6400000000003s)]
*  I think he's like 22 or 23 years old. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3672.76s)]
*  That's one area where he's like, we have to look into this. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3674.4s)]
*  What's going on with this? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3676.6400000000003s)]
*  And he's kept it kind of to him, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3677.48s)]
*  at the time the kid was 16 years old. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3678.32s)]
*  But I think there's some moments, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3680.44s)]
*  and they try to hide it as much as possible. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3681.7200000000003s)]
*  So Robert De Niro suggested there's a link [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3682.5600000000004s)]
*  between vaccines and autism. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3684.1600000000003s)]
*  You've never seen this interview? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3685.76s)]
*  No. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3686.7200000000003s)]
*  I have to show it to you afterwards, okay? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3687.5600000000004s)]
*  So he's talking about it, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3688.88s)]
*  and the host is trying to shut him up. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3690.5200000000004s)]
*  And he's, you know, you guys gotta see this documentary. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3692.7200000000003s)]
*  And he's not one that uses his kids as a, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3694.7200000000003s)]
*  we know where he's at with Trump, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3698.32s)]
*  we know he's got TDS, we know he loses his mind. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3699.7200000000003s)]
*  But when it comes down to vaccine and autism, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3701.96s)]
*  that is a very personal thing to want. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3705.5600000000004s)]
*  But can you imagine not being allowed to ask? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3707.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's a problem. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3709.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if that's true or not. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3710.88s)]
*  There's some evidence that it is true, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3712.6000000000004s)]
*  and we do know that they took the additive [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3714.1200000000003s)]
*  out of the vaccine, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3716.96s)]
*  but it of course had nothing to do with autism. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3718.0800000000004s)]
*  But like, in what world can't you ask that question, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3720.0800000000004s)]
*  or demand like a straightforward answer? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3723.0s)]
*  They're forcing your kids to take this stuff. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3724.52s)]
*  No, I mean, listen, if you think about business models, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3726.88s)]
*  Tucker, and I'll go back to the question [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3729.36s)]
*  about the media landscape. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3730.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3731.56s)]
*  I'll say this, and I'll go back to the media landscape. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3732.4s)]
*  If you think about business models, okay? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3734.4s)]
*  If you and I go to a hotel, how do hotels make money? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3737.48s)]
*  Let's just say you and I own a hotel with 2,000 beds, okay? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3741.56s)]
*  When we get our report from the guy [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3748.48s)]
*  that's running the hotel, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3750.08s)]
*  what number do we want at the end of the month? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3751.6s)]
*  We wanna know, out of the 31 days this month, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3753.88s)]
*  how many times, 2,000 beds, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3757.56s)]
*  that 60,000 times that these beds could have been rented, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3759.68s)]

*  Can we get it to 92%? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3769.48s)]
*  So what do we need? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3770.7999999999997s)]
*  We need people staying in our hotel to make money. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3771.64s)]
*  That's our business model. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3774.04s)]
*  The business model of a hotel isn't to have [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3775.3599999999997s)]
*  only 10% of the rooms being used. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3777.3199999999997s)]
*  You need people to stay back. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3779.04s)]
*  Okay, so what's the business model of hospitals? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3780.12s)]
*  It must be totally different, right? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3784.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3785.56s)]
*  And you need to have a lot of people [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3787.08s)]
*  that are spending a lot of money on their beds [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3788.48s)]
*  to be filled and by the way, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3791.08s)]

*  If you ask right now, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3798.2400000000002s)]
*  what's the number one industry [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3799.08s)]
*  of the most money they did last year? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3800.48s)]
*  You know what most people would say [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3802.64s)]
*  when they say energy, oil? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3803.44s)]
*  You know that's only half a trillion? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3804.92s)]
*  You know what's number one? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3806.28s)]
*  Hospitals. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3807.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3807.96s)]
*  One and a half trillion dollars. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3808.78s)]
*  And when they ask them on how much you charge [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3810.12s)]
*  for a basic surgery, bypass, or whatever it is, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3812.92s)]
*  why is that range such a big range? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3816.48s)]
*  And by the way, who controls your pricing [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3817.68s)]
*  and do you guys have to report [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3820.08s)]
*  on what it really costs you to do this? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3821.2s)]
*  And I think under Trump, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3822.44s)]
*  I don't know if you remember this in 2020, 2021, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3823.7200000000003s)]
*  he kind of came out with a law [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3825.76s)]
*  forcing hospitals to report honestly, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3828.44s)]
*  like here's what you're doing. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3830.64s)]
*  I think out of 500 hospitals, they audited 471, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3832.04s)]
*  never even completed their numbers on what they're, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3834.56s)]
*  so they're charging people. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3836.76s)]
*  So most people think it's providers making a lot of money. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3837.68s)]
*  Providers are not making a lot of money. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3840.08s)]
*  They're losing money. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3841.64s)]
*  The people that are making money is hospitals. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3842.92s)]
*  So hospital models, I need sick people. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3844.84s)]
*  Big pharma models, I need new diagnosis. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3847.6800000000003s)]
*  The more new diagnosis I have, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3850.4s)]
*  the more new drugs I can sell. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3851.8s)]
*  So I need new drug diagnosis. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3853.08s)]
*  What is the contractor's model, military contractor? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3855.52s)]
*  I need war. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3859.36s)]
*  If we don't have war, how the hell are we gonna make money? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3860.1800000000003s)]
*  If I go to mainstream media, what do I need? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3862.76s)]
*  Controversy, conflict, chaos. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3864.92s)]
*  That's how I make my money. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3867.2000000000003s)]
*  When you actually look at the business model [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3868.52s)]
*  of what these guys are doing, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3870.88s)]
*  they need chaos and problems to keep making money. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3872.6s)]
*  Okay, so that part is a very concerning thing. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3876.08s)]
*  So going back to mainstream media, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3878.48s)]
*  three things keeping them in. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3880.2799999999997s)]
*  Boomers, big pharma, boomers, and sports. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3882.36s)]
*  So now what sports is happening [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3885.36s)]
*  is a lot of these sports guys are realizing, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3886.72s)]
*  cable's not paying well. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3888.48s)]
*  I'm gonna go sign a contract with Peacock, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3889.92s)]
*  with Netflix, with Amazon, with all these guys. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3891.64s)]
*  They're paying good money. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3893.48s)]
*  They got a lot of money. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3894.64s)]
*  These other guys are dying. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3895.48s)]
*  Some of these smaller sports market are saying, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3896.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't want you to play it on TV. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3898.72s)]
*  Forget about it. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3899.88s)]
*  Means nothing to me what you're paying me. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3900.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm gonna do? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3902.36s)]
*  I'm gonna go out and put it on my own OTT. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3903.36s)]
*  I'm gonna put it on my over the top. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3905.28s)]
*  You wanna watch the game? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3906.6s)]
*  You can only see it on the Phoenix Suns over the top. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3907.52s)]
*  So holy shit, cable's like, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3910.2400000000002s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3913.1600000000003s)]
*  That's problematic. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3914.3s)]
*  Now the small market TV is getting crushed. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3915.6s)]
*  So cable, problematic, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3918.08s)]
*  they gotta figure out a solution there. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3919.8s)]
*  Let's go to conservative side. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3921.28s)]
*  On the conservative side, you got Daily Wire [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3923.2400000000002s)]
*  that they're dealing with whatever happened [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3925.2000000000003s)]
*  between Candice and Ben, which has been a problem [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3927.28s)]
*  that they've been trying to clean up. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3930.84s)]
*  Whatever the reasons are behind it. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3931.88s)]
*  That's the landscape of what they did, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3933.2000000000003s)]
*  the decision making process. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3936.08s)]

*  This is curiosity. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3970.2000000000003s)]
*  This is built on pure money and profit [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3972.04s)]
*  and wanting to sell and be a SPAC [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3974.1600000000003s)]
*  and go on the stock market and sell and I'm a billionaire. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=3975.56s)]

*  Schmidt and Vinnie went at it. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4135.72s)]

*  You had Steve Schmidt on? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4138.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4140.04s)]
*  Yeah, we've had a lot of weird people on. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4140.88s)]
*  I know him well. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4141.92s)]
*  We've known him for 25 years. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4143.56s)]
*  Literally 25, almost 30. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4145.24s)]
*  He's really a damaged character, whoa. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4147.04s)]
*  But not stupid. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4151.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, definitely not stupid. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4152.68s)]
*  But damaged makes sense because you feel his rage. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4155.4400000000005s)]
*  He's really got some, I don't know if it's anger issues [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4158.92s)]
*  or true hatred for certain people. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4162.0s)]
*  So now imagine Lincoln Project. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4164.36s)]
*  Now you've got multiple of them that's going through it. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4166.38s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, a part of DeSantis, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4169.68s)]
*  Trump was also not a good thing. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4171.8s)]
*  I think we'll recover from that, no problem. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4173.48s)]
*  I think DeSantis making the right moves [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4174.84s)]
*  right now, getting closer to Trump, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4176.24s)]
*  building that relationship. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4177.96s)]
*  I'm here to support you. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4178.96s)]
*  I think that's the right move for him to make. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4179.8s)]
*  I wish he would have done it earlier, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4182.28s)]
*  but never too late for him to take that route. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4183.4s)]
*  But I think- [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4185.72s)]
*  Why didn't he get the nomination? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4186.54s)]
*  For VP or for what? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4188.84s)]
*  For president. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4192.52s)]
*  I think he ran for the Republican nomination. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4193.360000000001s)]
*  Listen, I think there was a- [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4195.72s)]
*  Is that a dumb question? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4197.52s)]
*  No, listen, I said this. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4199.12s)]
*  To me, he's not a alpha to be a one. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4201.3s)]
*  He's a flag carrier. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4205.2s)]
*  And sometimes flag carriers that, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4207.04s)]
*  like he needs to go read the book 48 Laws of Power. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4210.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you read the book 48 Laws of Power. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4212.72s)]
*  He needs to go read 48 Laws of Power by himself, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4214.84s)]
*  don't tell anybody about it. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4217.2s)]
*  If he sees this, okay? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4218.96s)]
*  He needs to go read 48 Laws of Power [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4221.04s)]
*  and realize the number one mistake [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4223.44s)]
*  the Santa's made is law number one. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4225.48s)]
*  That's all he needs to do. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4227.4s)]
*  That's all I'm gonna say. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4228.32s)]
*  What's law number one? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4229.16s)]
*  Law number one is never outshine your master. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4229.98s)]
*  And that's what he did. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4231.88s)]
*  You don't ever do that, okay? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4232.72s)]
*  And in this case, master is a bad word to use, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4234.52s)]
*  but you can replace masters with a guy [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4238.12s)]
*  that helped you become a governor. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4240.26s)]
*  You never outshine that guy. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4242.04s)]
*  That is the kiss of death when you do that. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4243.9s)]
*  You cannot do that because that person forever [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4246.8s)]
*  is gonna know that secretly you always wanna take him out [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4249.72s)]
*  to have his throne. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4253.400000000001s)]
*  And once that's out there, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4254.8s)]
*  that guy cannot in the back of his mind [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4255.8s)]
*  ever take that away from his brain. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4257.320000000001s)]
*  It's always gonna be here. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4259.12s)]
*  It's gonna be like, oh, I know where you're at. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4259.96s)]
*  Okay, no problem. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4261.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, no, but you, no, no, I know what you want. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4262.52s)]
*  I know deep down inside you want my throne, no problem. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4265.12s)]
*  Versus a role he could have played like a godfather, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4267.58s)]
*  what is it, that Robert DeVaul plays always butchers him. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4272.84s)]
*  It's Tom Hagna, what's the guy's name? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4276.2s)]
*  Consolieri to the boss. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4278.04s)]
*  You obviously watch many movies. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4280.28s)]
*  I've just seen all these questions. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4281.6s)]
*  Not too many movies, like none. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4283.08s)]
*  Very obviously, you're a big movie guy here. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4285.16s)]
*  But no, I think that's the part. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4287.46s)]
*  I think once he did that, it was bad for him, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4288.8s)]
*  but he's 45, he's got plenty of run rate. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4292.44s)]
*  He just needs to be a phenomenal flag carrier. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4295.6s)]
*  But can a flag carrier ever ascend to the alpha position? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4299.32s)]
*  For sure, Biden was a flag carrier. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4302.5199999999995s)]
*  For sure, George Bush Sr. is a flag carrier. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4304.5199999999995s)]
*  Nixon was a flag carrier. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4307.52s)]
*  The model of flag carrier is actually [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4310.72s)]
*  very easy to be a president. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4312.080000000001s)]
*  Ulysses S. Crand was a flag carrier, right? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4313.88s)]
*  And then boom, he became two term. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4316.320000000001s)]
*  Not necessarily the best president, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4317.360000000001s)]
*  but they did become a president. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4319.06s)]
*  So if you're solving for being a president, you can do it, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4320.22s)]
*  but you gotta be a great flag carrier. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4322.200000000001s)]
*  Most of the time, flag carriers are not [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4324.240000000001s)]
*  the best communicators. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4325.72s)]
*  Most of the time, flag carriers are not the best [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4327.120000000001s)]
*  to get up there and do what they do. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4329.040000000001s)]
*  They need somebody to edify them. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4330.6s)]
*  So if you're not the best orator, speaker, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4332.700000000001s)]
*  you're a very good day to day getting policies [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4335.9s)]
*  and stuff done, which he can do. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4338.58s)]
*  He's a very smart guy. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4339.94s)]
*  You need a big orator with a big mic to defend you [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4341.5s)]
*  and back you up, he lost that mic. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4344.379999999999s)]
*  And he's gotta figure out what to gain that mic back for 2028. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4346.299999999999s)]
*  Fascinating, I think correct. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4350.0599999999995s)]
*  I wanna go back to something you said a second ago. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4352.219999999999s)]
*  You said that, in fact, you even looked at me [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4353.78s)]
*  like it was a dumb question, which it probably was. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4356.099999999999s)]
*  October 7th was a pivot point in conservative media, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4358.5199999999995s)]
*  and it divided it. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4362.42s)]
*  How and why, and is it permanent? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4364.32s)]
*  Ah, man, I mean, listen, anybody that's a big talent, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4368.639999999999s)]
*  deep down inside, there's probably some ego, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4373.5199999999995s)]
*  some a lot of ego, like I'm better than you ego, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4377.599999999999s)]
*  I'm smarter than that guy, and it's tough to admit [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4380.679999999999s)]
*  to a mistake while you're going through it. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4384.98s)]
*  Some of these guys made massive mistakes, right? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4387.44s)]
*  Now, the problem- [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4390.46s)]
*  Like what? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4391.299999999999s)]
*  The position you take with Candice, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4393.14s)]
*  that's a problematic position. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4395.26s)]
*  Now, to give him credit, he came out and said, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4396.9800000000005s)]
*  Daily Wire is not a platform, we're a publisher. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4400.88s)]
*  As a publisher, we can't let go of anybody. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4404.0s)]
*  You're right, totally fine, you can do that for sure. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4405.740000000001s)]
*  And then the argument is, well, we had Dave Rubin on, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4408.92s)]
*  and Rubin says, well, you don't know the whole story, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4411.18s)]
*  and you know what's going on there, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4414.3s)]
*  and she had said something, and da-da-da-da-da, okay. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4415.38s)]
*  Yeah, she questions certain questions. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4418.280000000001s)]
*  Now, you may say, we're not comfortable with this, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4420.32s)]
*  no problem. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4422.36s)]
*  But your position when you knock off, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4424.36s)]
*  you go after, Candice talking about crisis kink, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4429.44s)]
*  and then you're playing the games, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4432.5199999999995s)]
*  and then if the story comes out, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4434.46s)]
*  the fact that they use Candice asking Ben for a debate [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4436.04s)]
*  as a form of getting the gag order, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4439.04s)]
*  if that story comes out, let's just say that story's true, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4441.48s)]
*  I think Glenn Greenwald reported on it. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4443.98s)]
*  If that is true, if it's not true, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4446.34s)]
*  well, then Glenn Greenwald's gotta go through it [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4449.08s)]
*  and say what he's gotta say. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4450.76s)]
*  But if that story is true, that they use the tweet [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4452.04s)]
*  from Candice to almost lure her in, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4454.24s)]
*  and then call the lawyers to, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4457.98s)]
*  if that story ever comes out in the next year, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4459.5199999999995s)]
*  two years, three years, if that comes out, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4462.28s)]
*  that's very problematic, because talent is gonna have [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4465.0199999999995s)]
*  to feel comfortable going somewhere. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4468.0599999999995s)]
*  Great talent is gonna have to go somewhere [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4470.16s)]
*  that they feel safe, they feel protected. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4473.88s)]
*  A Dana White is a great case study for this. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4476.2s)]
*  Conor McGregor, a diva, loud, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4478.78s)]
*  problematic sometimes, chaotic. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4482.099999999999s)]
*  Dana knows how to work with him. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4485.259999999999s)]
*  Phil Jackson, nobody wanted Dennis Rodman. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4487.54s)]
*  Phil knows how to work with Dennis Rodman. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4489.94s)]
*  Come here, we'll win. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4491.8s)]
*  He goes to the Lakers, come here, we'll win. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4493.099999999999s)]
*  They did, right? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4494.96s)]
*  And before Chuck Daly, who was a coach of the Pistons, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4496.24s)]
*  Draymond Green, Steve Kerr can handle that, right? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4500.3s)]
*  It's sometimes talent, if you look at how they are, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4503.38s)]
*  there needs to be somebody that knows how to work [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4507.06s)]
*  with them as well. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4508.900000000001s)]
*  You have to show, as a publisher, as a media company, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4509.9400000000005s)]
*  that you know how to get talent. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4513.9400000000005s)]
*  Build them up, and also you know how to be on closed doors [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4515.5s)]
*  to massage and work with them while they're going through [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4518.620000000001s)]
*  their changes, as a talent. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4520.46s)]
*  If you don't know how to manage ego and manage divas, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4522.740000000001s)]
*  you're eventually gonna lose your best talent [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4525.46s)]
*  to elsewhere that knows how to do that. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4528.9400000000005s)]
*  And number two, the divas are always gonna be scared [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4530.76s)]
*  of someone like you, because that's the one thing [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4533.900000000001s)]
*  they don't want. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4535.22s)]
*  They don't want to go to a place to be like, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4536.34s)]
*  hey, here's what I need you to do. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4537.5s)]
*  And what eventually ends up happening is the following. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4538.9400000000005s)]
*  Eventually, look at Fox's reputation. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4541.3s)]
*  You got Bill O'Reilly, you got Beck, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4545.58s)]
*  you got Megan, you got you, okay? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4548.66s)]
*  What do all four of you guys have in common? [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4551.3s)]
*  I know them all. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4553.1s)]
*  Of course you do. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4554.5s)]
*  You guys were all number one, you guys crushed it [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4555.38s)]
*  on cable TV for God knows how many years, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4559.22s)]
*  and you guys all had a ugly falling out at the end. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4561.58s)]
*  Fox has to rebuild that reputation [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4565.54s)]
*  if they want to attract talent like that. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4568.1s)]
*  If not, what they're gonna end up catching themselves doing [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4570.88s)]
*  is, especially at a time where more people are realizing, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4574.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't need you. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4576.5s)]
*  This is very problematic. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4577.94s)]
*  It's not like the leverage is on them. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4579.14s)]
*  They can, the way some of these media companies [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4580.94s)]
*  are acting today, they could have gone away with that [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4583.66s)]
*  20 years ago. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4586.74s)]
*  You can't today, because talent has a choice. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4587.56s)]
*  They didn't have a choice 20 years ago. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4591.22s)]
*  Where am I gonna go 20 years ago? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4592.98s)]
*  Think about it. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4594.38s)]
*  20 years ago, if I'm working for CNN or MSNBC [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4595.780000000001s)]
*  and I got a show, and Rachel Maddow and whatever, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4598.18s)]
*  Brian Stelter and all the guys, and all of a sudden, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4600.9800000000005s)]
*  they go super left, and you're in between the Maddow show. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4603.66s)]
*  Boom, you know what? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4606.1s)]
*  I just don't think they have a place for me. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4607.02s)]
*  This guy's done. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4608.7s)]
*  Wait, that actually happened to me. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4609.54s)]
*  I know, that's what I'm saying. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4610.62s)]
*  That's what I'm reading. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4611.7s)]
*  I was like, that sounds so familiar. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4612.54s)]
*  Well, and then John Stewart, well, let me tell you, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4614.820000000001s)]
*  you just gotta stop. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4617.7s)]
*  By the way, that would be a very good, interesting podcast [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4618.58s)]
*  if you ever do with John Stewart. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4621.3s)]
*  He's so pathetic. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4622.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4622.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it would be interesting. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4625.58s)]
*  I wanna be a good sport about it. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4627.58s)]
*  I think the world would watch it. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4628.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the world would watch [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4631.46s)]
*  all kinds of ugly things, but I just try to think, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4633.54s)]
*  I have such contempt for him, I guess. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4637.780000000001s)]
*  Maybe that would make it hard. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4639.34s)]
*  I like interviewing people I disagree with. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4641.42s)]
*  Chris Cuomo I interviewed, and I totally disagree [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4643.06s)]
*  with Chris Cuomo on so much, and I've made fun of him [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4646.9800000000005s)]
*  so much, I've been really mean to him, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4648.900000000001s)]
*  but I don't have contempt for Chris Cuomo at all, actually. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4650.54s)]
*  But John Stewart, I have total contempt for him. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4654.46s)]
*  I think he's like, I don't have no respect at all, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4656.22s)]
*  and I never have, and that hasn't changed [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4660.18s)]
*  in the 20 years since I last saw him. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4662.58s)]
*  So it's hard to interview. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4664.9s)]
*  Have you ever interviewed someone [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4666.18s)]
*  you have no respect for at all? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4667.02s)]
*  Of course. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4668.66s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4669.62s)]
*  Of course it is. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4670.46s)]
*  I don't like it. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4671.3s)]
*  It's not easy. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4672.14s)]
*  It's like, I don't give a shit what you say. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4672.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, you're pathetic. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4674.78s)]
*  It's not even your real name. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4676.5s)]
*  Everything about you is fake. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4677.86s)]
*  You're just fake, and you're kind of a dumb person [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4679.14s)]
*  posing as a smart person, like everything about it. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4682.34s)]
*  Ugh, barf. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4684.26s)]
*  So I don't know if I can do that. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4686.5s)]
*  No, listen, I understand, and I can only imagine, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4688.14s)]
*  because I'm the viewer. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4691.46s)]
*  I'm not even you to know what the real context is. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4692.38s)]
*  When I interviewed the creepy porn lawyer, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4695.38s)]
*  Michael Labanetti, there was, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4697.02s)]
*  I mean, he's a very menacing person, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4699.06s)]
*  and not a great person, obviously, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4700.860000000001s)]
*  and I totally disagree with him. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4703.18s)]
*  On the other hand, he had kind of an energy [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4704.860000000001s)]
*  that I didn't disrespect. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4706.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, he's just like a very energetic guy. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4708.66s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4710.46s)]
*  But Jon Stewart's like a freaking NPR listener [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4711.66s)]
*  who takes it seriously. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4715.82s)]
*  He's just like, I'm just so over that. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4717.0599999999995s)]
*  It's so mediocre. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4719.0199999999995s)]
*  You know what would be interesting about it? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4720.66s)]
*  Because from the scene of him coming [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4722.3s)]
*  and trying to bully you guys to where you are today, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4724.18s)]
*  you won. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4727.18s)]
*  That's the point. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4728.5s)]
*  Well, I thought I won then. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4729.34s)]
*  Well, but. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4730.5s)]
*  Which is just, I'm a little out of it. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4731.34s)]
*  But you may have won. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4734.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, I lost in the court of public opinion, for sure. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4735.58s)]
*  Right, that's the part. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4737.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. But today, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4738.86s)]
*  it's not even a conversation. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4740.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4741.700000000001s)]
*  So you were talking about the media business, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4742.54s)]
*  and I'd asked you, you said October 7th [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4744.860000000001s)]
*  really split conservative media. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4747.18s)]
*  Yes, it did permanently? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4748.46s)]
*  No, not at all. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4751.34s)]
*  No, people are gonna have their, certain people, yes. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4752.740000000001s)]
*  But for the most part, you know, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4756.26s)]
*  look at Marco Rubio. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4758.58s)]
*  Oh, he's considered a vice presidential potential. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4759.54s)]
*  What? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4763.18s)]
*  After what happened, hence? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4764.1s)]
*  Yeah, and people move on. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4765.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4766.900000000001s)]
*  This is a very media politics sport. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4767.74s)]
*  You talk shit, you get pissed, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4770.7s)]
*  cannot believe it, clickish, all this stuff. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4772.38s)]
*  And then eventually, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4774.62s)]
*  somebody typically behind closed doors says, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4775.58s)]
*  what matters more, your ego or America? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4777.58s)]
*  Well, can I have both? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4779.94s)]
*  Not all the time. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4781.26s)]
*  Okay, then America. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4782.54s)]
*  You're gonna raise your kids here? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4783.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4784.3s)]
*  All right, let's figure this thing out, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4785.139999999999s)]
*  and we move on. Smart. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4785.98s)]
*  Well, I agree with that completely. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4786.98s)]
*  I'm surrounded by people who I once hated. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4788.34s)]
*  So yes, I feel that way really, really strongly. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4790.46s)]
*  Chris Cuomo, though, who I've already said I like, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4793.26s)]
*  and I mean it, and I think is talented, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4796.14s)]
*  is having trouble, from my read, reentering the Congress. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4799.58s)]
*  People are still mad at Chris Cuomo about COVID. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4804.26s)]
*  Is that your take on it? [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4807.14s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4808.14s)]
*  And by the way, even more now, by the way. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4808.9800000000005s)]
*  More now? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4811.02s)]
*  I think it's more now. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4812.1s)]
*  And here's why it's more now. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4813.02s)]
*  Because at least four years ago, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4815.18s)]
*  one side loved him and the other side hated him. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4818.5s)]
*  Four years ago. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4823.3s)]
*  Now both sides hate him. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4824.98s)]
*  You may say why? [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4827.9s)]
*  Very simple. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4829.139999999999s)]
*  So he was there to the left, to the establishment. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4830.54s)]
*  He was a hero. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4836.299999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4837.78s)]
*  You should take the vaccine. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4838.62s)]
*  What is all this horse, you know, Iver McClink stuff? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4840.379999999999s)]
*  What's this all about? [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4842.339999999999s)]
*  You're being irresponsible by Ron Donaldson. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4844.66s)]
*  Yes, what a great citizen Cuomo is, right? [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4846.259999999999s)]
*  Face of CNN, Big Pharma, and all these guys. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4849.54s)]
*  We like what he's doing, right? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4851.9s)]
*  And the writer's like, why are you making me take it? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4853.58s)]
*  I don't wanna take it. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4855.18s)]
*  Let it be my choice. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4856.34s)]
*  Now, you mean to tell me you're going from that position [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4857.74s)]
*  to on the podcast saying, I'm taking Iver McClink now? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4862.34s)]
*  And yeah, I guess Joe Rogan was right. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4866.62s)]
*  You're saying that now. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4868.74s)]
*  And I'm Vax injured. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4869.98s)]
*  And I'm not only Vax injured. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4871.46s)]
*  And then when I ask him, if COVID comes back in 2026 [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4873.3s)]
*  and they're forcing everybody to take the vaccine, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4878.54s)]
*  would you take it? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4880.5s)]
*  He says, absolutely not. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4881.34s)]
*  So you wouldn't take it. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4882.38s)]
*  Okay, so obviously when he says that, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4884.18s)]
*  you have to keep in mind that, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4888.7s)]
*  how is Fauci feel about that? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4891.820000000001s)]
*  Probably not good. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4893.900000000001s)]
*  How is people from CDC, the doctors, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4895.14s)]
*  how do they feel about it? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4899.1s)]
*  Probably not good. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4900.46s)]
*  How about some of the people from his side [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4902.22s)]
*  that were all on a show and he was taking care of him, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4903.9400000000005s)]
*  defending him, they can't stand him right now. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4906.14s)]
*  Because what he's doing is he's bringing back something [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4908.9800000000005s)]
*  that's been under the rug and almost disappeared. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4912.099999999999s)]
*  Because everybody's now talking about what? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4916.339999999999s)]
*  Immigration, everybody's talking about [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4917.58s)]
*  all these other issues. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4918.86s)]
*  Immigration, election 2024. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4920.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, what happened? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4923.219999999999s)]
*  What about the gain of function? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4924.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but forget about it. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4925.139999999999s)]
*  Well, let's focus on all this stuff. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4925.98s)]
*  What about what China? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4927.219999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about October 7th. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4928.0599999999995s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4929.219999999999s)]
*  So I think what he's doing is a massive risk. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4930.339999999999s)]
*  But wait a second, it doesn't, okay, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4934.58s)]
*  so what you're saying makes sense on one side. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4936.339999999999s)]
*  Clearly his former allies are mad. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4939.339999999999s)]
*  They feel betrayed. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4940.74s)]
*  He's exposing the lies. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4942.3s)]
*  But doesn't that give him new allies? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4944.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I'm having dinner tonight, for example, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4946.0599999999995s)]
*  with Glenn Greenwald, who I love [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4947.82s)]
*  and consider a friend of mine. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4950.0199999999995s)]
*  Sure. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4951.3s)]
*  And Glenn Greenwald must have written [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4952.139999999999s)]
*  50 Pieces Attacking Me 20 years ago. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4953.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4955.94s)]
*  But then we aligned on a couple of big issues, real issues. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4956.78s)]
*  And I'm happy to be friends with Glenn Greenwald. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4960.3s)]
*  I've changed my views on a lot of issues. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4963.54s)]
*  I believe in repentance. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4965.0599999999995s)]
*  I think change is essential. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4966.5s)]
*  As the facts change, so should your conclusions. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4967.7s)]
*  This is all good. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4969.62s)]
*  And so normally the once was lost, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4971.9400000000005s)]
*  now I've found people find a new home. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4973.7s)]
*  But he doesn't seem to have found a new home. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4976.820000000001s)]
*  No, because he hasn't repented and asked for forgiveness. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4979.02s)]
*  And that's not easy to do. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4984.22s)]
*  It's so easy to do. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4986.1s)]
*  It's the easiest thing there is. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4988.3s)]
*  I fucked up, I'm sorry. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4990.42s)]
*  That's the most simple liberating act in life. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4992.02s)]
*  Yeah, but let me ask you a question. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4997.38s)]
*  So here's the question for you. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=4998.5s)]
*  You're married, right? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5000.26s)]
*  Your family. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5001.46s)]
*  You have your kid. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5002.62s)]
*  You got your thing. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5004.02s)]
*  You got your community. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5004.900000000001s)]
*  Imagine all of a sudden, you get so close to Fauci [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5006.42s)]
*  and you're all of a sudden hanging out with Rachel Maddow. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5012.26s)]
*  You guys are best friends. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5014.3s)]
*  And you're hanging out with all these guys on the left. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5016.22s)]
*  And suddenly you sit there and say, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5021.06s)]
*  no, the right was wrong. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5024.38s)]
*  Everybody should take the vaccine. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5026.46s)]
*  Everybody should go through it. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5028.58s)]
*  Okay, so imagine you take a position like that suddenly. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5030.22s)]
*  How's your wife feel about it? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5033.7s)]
*  How's your family feel about it? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5035.3s)]
*  How do your lineage of what you've done, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5036.78s)]
*  your history, where you come from, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5040.34s)]
*  how do they feel about it? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5042.26s)]
*  All the other, so you have to sleep next to your wife. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5043.42s)]
*  Now, so for Chris, as he's going through this process [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5049.7s)]
*  and you're talking to the guy off camera, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5054.46s)]
*  my kids absolutely love this guy when he comes in. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5057.46s)]
*  He wrestles, does jujitsu with my kids. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5061.18s)]
*  They're doing this, they're doing that. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5062.94s)]
*  Off camera, we have the most fiery as arguments. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5064.5s)]
*  Hour, two hour, three hour, just absolute like, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5068.26s)]
*  boom, boom, boom, and then hey, okay, man, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5071.06s)]
*  I'll talk to you next week, done, right? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5072.74s)]
*  And a part of me, I'm not speaking on his behalf, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5075.42s)]
*  this is something he needs to make a decision for himself is [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5079.42s)]
*  when I go through it and I process it, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5081.9800000000005s)]
*  he gives me zero vibes of somebody's on the left, zero. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5084.86s)]
*  Chris Cuomo? [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5089.0599999999995s)]
*  No, he's not someone. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5089.94s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5091.339999999999s)]
*  Let me explain what I mean. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5093.38s)]
*  It's almost like being around someone who, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5094.78s)]
*  he's not in touch with himself [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5097.42s)]
*  and he doesn't know what everyone else knows about him. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5098.7s)]
*  And Chris Cuomo, you look at Chris Cuomo, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5101.38s)]
*  he's like, you are in no sense a liberal, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5102.219999999999s)]
*  temperamentally, at all. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5104.299999999999s)]
*  No, he's not, he's not a liberal. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5105.139999999999s)]
*  Now, he may be a center left guy, okay, fine. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5106.54s)]
*  He may be a center right guy, economically right. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5109.82s)]
*  Vaccine, not for it now, doesn't like what happened with it. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5114.14s)]
*  When he thinks about certain things with, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5117.900000000001s)]
*  there's so many things that you can go on, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5121.18s)]
*  but the guy's, he has risen. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5122.900000000001s)]
*  Who's the only person that texts me [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5125.900000000001s)]
*  when it's Easter or any of these, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5127.22s)]
*  and first guy that texts me, it's him. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5128.660000000001s)]
*  So spiritually, what he's going through, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5130.02s)]
*  these are all stuff that you look at, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5131.9400000000005s)]
*  like, okay, maybe he's going through it, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5133.5s)]
*  maybe he's going through what he's doing right now. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5135.1s)]
*  But for him to come out of- [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5136.58s)]
*  He's afraid of the feminists, that's part of it. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5138.18s)]
*  I can feel that. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5140.26s)]
*  I said that to him, right, to him. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5141.1s)]
*  He's afraid. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5142.22s)]
*  If you care what the feminists think, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5143.42s)]
*  and obviously you shouldn't, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5145.06s)]
*  because it's so degrading to care what they think, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5146.1s)]
*  but then you have to mouth certain lies, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5148.780000000001s)]
*  and you're like required, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5151.34s)]
*  because you're afraid of the screechiness. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5152.38s)]
*  But they don't respect you more for repeating their lies. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5154.780000000001s)]
*  They actually see you as a bitch when you do that. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5157.5s)]
*  They want you to be strong. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5159.38s)]
*  They're feminists in the first place, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5161.06s)]
*  because they haven't been around men [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5162.1s)]
*  who are just honest and direct and strong. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5163.34s)]
*  So you cannot be afraid of them. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5165.5s)]
*  And I really get the feeling, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5166.780000000001s)]
*  like he can't say certain things, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5167.9400000000005s)]
*  because he's afraid of the feminists. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5170.46s)]
*  I put something above that, though. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5171.3s)]
*  I put his last name and his family above it. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5173.02s)]
*  Well, I get that, though. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5174.74s)]
*  I have total sympathy for Chris. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5175.7s)]
*  I put that as number one. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5176.54s)]
*  That's number one. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5177.38s)]
*  His father, his brother, I put that as number one. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5178.22s)]
*  And I feel like if he comes out and fully flips, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5179.9400000000005s)]
*  he gets that. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5182.62s)]
*  And the other part for me is a- [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5183.46s)]
*  Well, can I say, I respect that. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5184.54s)]
*  Yeah, I do as well. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5185.9800000000005s)]
*  That's the one thing you're not being a bitch [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5186.820000000001s)]
*  for respecting your father's legacy, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5189.9800000000005s)]
*  or remaining close to your brother. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5192.02s)]
*  Like, you should do that. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5193.860000000001s)]
*  So I feel for him. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5194.860000000001s)]
*  Right, and then there's the other part, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5196.26s)]
*  the school of thought of when you apologize [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5198.62s)]
*  that will forever come after you. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5200.78s)]
*  You should be careful to apologize. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5201.9s)]
*  Never apologize. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5203.219999999999s)]
*  There's a community as well. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5204.0599999999995s)]
*  Who are those people? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5205.46s)]
*  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5206.58s)]
*  Whoever's in your ear. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5208.0599999999995s)]
*  Whoever tells you that- [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5209.259999999999s)]
*  Never apologize? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5210.099999999999s)]
*  You look like a fool if you don't apologize. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5210.94s)]
*  You should not apologize. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5212.0199999999995s)]
*  If they do, they will come after you [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5213.3s)]
*  for the rest of your life. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5215.219999999999s)]
*  You should apologize only when you mean it. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5216.5s)]
*  That's the rule. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5219.62s)]
*  Don't lie. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5220.5s)]
*  So of course you never apologize. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5221.74s)]
*  If you get caught up in some fake me too thing, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5223.259999999999s)]
*  you're like, I should have been more sensitive [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5225.58s)]

*  You're annoying. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5440.419999999999s)]
*  One of the most attractive qualities of a human being [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5441.82s)]
*  is self-deprecation. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5444.0599999999995s)]
*  Of course. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5445.219999999999s)]

*  laugh at yourself, make fun of yourself. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5447.66s)]
*  The audience is like, man, I can't believe I like this guy. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5449.78s)]
*  But why is that so appealing? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5451.66s)]
*  Think it through. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5453.0199999999995s)]
*  Because none of us walk on water. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5453.86s)]
*  We all make mistakes. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5455.54s)]
*  Because it telegraphs strength. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5456.379999999999s)]
*  That's what strong people do. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5458.339999999999s)]
*  Who refuses to apologize? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5459.58s)]
*  Who refuses to admit fault? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5461.18s)]
*  Who refuses to admit being human? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5462.58s)]
*  Making a mistake. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5464.74s)]
*  People who are so fragile, they can't admit it. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5465.78s)]
*  Weak people hide their weaknesses. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5469.0199999999995s)]
*  Strong people are happy to admit them [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5471.78s)]
*  because they're transparent. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5474.14s)]
*  They've got nothing to hide. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5475.86s)]
*  That's a sign of strength. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5477.1s)]

*  So not apologizing diminishes you dramatically. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5481.74s)]
*  You're fearful. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5487.42s)]
*  That's why you can't apologize, right? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5488.26s)]
*  Yeah, but he's got to, you know, again. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5490.9400000000005s)]
*  And I'm not talking about Chris specifically, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5493.26s)]
*  who again, I really like. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5495.26s)]
*  And I will say just to be very clear again, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5496.26s)]
*  if he can't fully apologize for things he said [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5500.3s)]
*  that were demonstrably wrong [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5506.22s)]
*  because he doesn't want to dishonor [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5507.58s)]
*  the memory of his father or alienate his brother, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5509.34s)]
*  I respect that. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5512.62s)]
*  I do. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5513.66s)]
*  It's worth wrecking your career [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5514.78s)]
*  to remain loyal to your family. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5516.98s)]

*  Whoever you speak to, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5524.179999999999s)]
*  the last three people you speak to before you go to sleep [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5526.5s)]
*  have the most influence over you. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5529.179999999999s)]
*  The last three people you speak to before you go to sleep. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5530.9s)]
*  What if it's a dog? [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5532.78s)]
*  Well, that's good influence then. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5533.82s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5535.3s)]
*  It's a very good lesson. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5536.139999999999s)]
*  One of mine is. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5536.98s)]
*  One of mine is a very intimidating, massive, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5537.82s)]
*  I don't know if you're into big dogs, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5542.099999999999s)]
*  I have a 15 pound Shih Tzu, extremely intimidating. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5543.18s)]
*  But this guy loves me [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5545.740000000001s)]
*  and he makes me feel very confident by the way. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5547.5s)]
*  That's what matters. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5549.22s)]
*  He believes in me and that's where I get my. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5550.06s)]
*  It's love no matter how embarrassing the dog [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5551.900000000001s)]
*  as long as he loves you. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5553.54s)]
*  He's amazing to me. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5554.38s)]
*  He's been my number one therapist for 15 years. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5555.22s)]
*  So when you look at the last three people you speak to, [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5557.26s)]
*  I can't take inventory of that. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5560.42s)]
*  But who are you talking to? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5562.3s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5563.14s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5564.700000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you want to go through somebody [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5565.9400000000005s)]
*  and ask what do you think? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5567.66s)]
*  Maybe it's your wife. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5568.5s)]
*  Maybe it's your brother. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5569.34s)]
*  Maybe it's a former mentor. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5570.42s)]
*  Maybe it's a father. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5572.0199999999995s)]
*  Maybe whoever your what do you think community is [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5572.86s)]
*  is the reason why you're making the decision [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5576.58s)]
*  the way that you are. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5579.259999999999s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5580.099999999999s)]
*  The better the what do you think community you have, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5580.94s)]
*  the better way you handle conflicts. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5582.9s)]
*  I don't know the what do you think community is for Chris. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5584.179999999999s)]
*  That's a really smart point. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5588.339999999999s)]
*  What's your relationship with him now? [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5589.66s)]
*  You're in a business relationship, right? [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5591.299999999999s)]
*  We're doing a debate next. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5594.139999999999s)]
*  Dave Smith called him out [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5597.139999999999s)]
*  and I know you're a Dave guy. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5598.459999999999s)]
*  I like Dave a lot. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5599.5s)]
*  Dave's a talent. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5600.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Dave's a, I think he's a star [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5601.48s)]
*  that can be a superstar in the right environment. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5604.5199999999995s)]
*  That guy has what it takes to really strive. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5606.8s)]
*  Anybody that gets a chance to sign him, they should. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5611.0199999999995s)]
*  And if he kind of signs with somebody long term, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5612.92s)]
*  five years, he finds a way. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5614.92s)]
*  Should he be a comedian or a political commentator? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5616.24s)]
*  I think he cares about policies more than comedy. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5620.12s)]
*  I think, you know, he likes comedy. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5624.24s)]
*  I think that's his creative side. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5628.08s)]
*  But he has a serious side [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5630.04s)]
*  that he needs to find a way to tap into it. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5632.68s)]
*  I don't know what his vision is. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5634.6s)]
*  He knows what he wants to do with his life. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5635.72s)]
*  But Dave and Chris will be having a Friday night debate [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5637.16s)]
*  at our comedy club cigar lounge [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5641.66s)]
*  in Fort Lauderdale May 31st, 6 to 9 p.m. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5643.36s)]
*  Live audience. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5645.82s)]
*  Who's gonna win? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5647.56s)]
*  Whoever is straight up and doesn't play politics. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5650.4s)]
*  It's asymmetrical though, [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5654.12s)]
*  because Chris has, and I like them both, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5655.24s)]
*  but first of all, Dave is a formidable debate opponent. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5658.72s)]
*  Fantastic. Yeah. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5662.2s)]
*  Fantastic. For real. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5663.2s)]
*  And very smart as a debater. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5664.68s)]
*  I can say that guy is good. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5666.52s)]
*  But second, Dave can say whatever he wants. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5668.72s)]
*  You know, he's not, you know what I mean? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5670.52s)]
*  He's already made his break with family members [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5672.26s)]
*  who disagree with him or whatever, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5675.92s)]
*  but he's totally unencumbered. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5677.2s)]
*  And Chris is from a very famous family. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5679.08s)]
*  Brother and dad were governor of the state of New York. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5682.08s)]
*  It's like, it's hard. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5683.9800000000005s)]
*  I can tell you every day I visualize people calling him, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5685.32s)]
*  telling him not to do it. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5691.4s)]
*  Every single day, every day, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5692.94s)]
*  someone tell him don't do the podcast [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5696.84s)]
*  in their own creative way. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5698.84s)]
*  And I said this when I announced it, okay? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5700.12s)]
*  So when it happens, the side of the establishment [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5702.759999999999s)]
*  that doesn't want all this, the CDC guy comes out [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5707.08s)]
*  and you saw what he said. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5709.48s)]
*  Hey, did you guys do any kind of gain on function? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5710.32s)]
*  Rand Paul is asking Fauci, 2021. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5713.2s)]
*  No, we didn't do any. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5718.84s)]
*  There was no such thing of gain on function. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5719.96s)]
*  And then they asked the new guy, the CDC guy. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5722.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this or not. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5725.32s)]
*  This was, is there any such a, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5726.44s)]
*  well, in the general way of looking at this, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5729.04s)]
*  yes, there was gain on function. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5732.5599999999995s)]
*  No, no, it's not general or not. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5734.12s)]
*  Was there or was there not? [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5735.599999999999s)]
*  Yes, there was. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5736.599999999999s)]
*  You think that community wants more eyeballs going to this? [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5737.5599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5740.36s)]
*  Why is no one in prison? [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5741.44s)]
*  I mean, if you're doing gain of function research, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5742.84s)]
*  in other words, if you're trying to make dangerous viruses [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5744.639999999999s)]
*  more infectious and more dangerous [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5747.679999999999s)]
*  in a world with a demonstrated history of lab leaks, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5750.28s)]
*  thank you Lyme disease and all the rest [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5754.28s)]
*  that we know COVID have come from labs. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5756.599999999999s)]
*  Like you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5760.08s)]
*  Like why should you be allowed to do that? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5763.36s)]
*  When they're trying to put Trump in prison [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5765.5599999999995s)]
*  for the rest of his life on a documents charge, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5766.5599999999995s)]
*  you brought home documents that are technically classified, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5768.24s)]
*  but the guys doing gain of fucking function research [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5770.36s)]
*  are walking free? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5772.88s)]
*  Like what? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5773.799999999999s)]
*  How bad do you want to know to investigate those people? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5774.719999999999s)]
*  Investigate? [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5777.16s)]
*  I mean, I think we know. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5778.08s)]
*  Oh, but the point is to hold them accountable to it, right? [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5779.48s)]
*  How bad do you know? [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5781.96s)]
*  Well, it's just absolutely crazy. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5782.78s)]
*  We're mad at guys with nose rings [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5783.759999999999s)]
*  protesting inside Columbia. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5786.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, whatever, I'm not on their side, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5788.0s)]
*  but like who cares actually? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5789.48s)]
*  But the point, the reason why I'm asking you the question is, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5791.0s)]
*  the point why I'm asking you this question is, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5793.16s)]
*  in order for that to happen, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5795.28s)]
*  if the establishment from the left or the right [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5797.759999999999s)]
*  is an office, you will never find out, ever find out. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5800.68s)]
*  This is why we need more guys [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5805.36s)]
*  from the anti-establishment side to say, [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5807.28s)]
*  I'm really curious to the point [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5809.92s)]
*  where I'm gonna go in there and find out. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5811.4s)]
*  Well, how would you assess Bobby Kennedy? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5812.24s)]
*  What's your? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5813.52s)]
*  I think Bobby Kennedy is a form of anti-establishment. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5815.0s)]
*  And if I'm able to give people a score of reason, okay, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5821.14s)]
*  and a true believer. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5825.32s)]
*  So meaning, can this guy truly reason? [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5826.84s)]
*  So you got family pride and stuff [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5829.48s)]
*  that's part of your legacy, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5831.12s)]
*  and he's got what the most powerful last thing on the left, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5832.799999999999s)]
*  I think that's way ahead of Cuomo's, it's Kennedy. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5835.28s)]
*  There is no level of Kennedy, right? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5838.179999999999s)]
*  Okay, criminal crop at that level. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5840.04s)]
*  So what's the score for being able to reason? [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5842.379999999999s)]
*  I think it's pretty high. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5845.679999999999s)]
*  I give him a high score for reasoning. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5847.08s)]
*  On the podcast that we did together was like a town hall. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5849.24s)]
*  People are asking questions. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5853.5599999999995s)]
*  I asked him, I said, so what do you stand with [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5854.44s)]
*  puberty blockers and transgender and all this stuff? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5856.679999999999s)]
*  I said, honestly, I haven't done enough research [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5858.56s)]
*  to be for or against. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5859.88s)]
*  I said, Bobby, you can't say that. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5862.400000000001s)]
*  So what's the- [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5863.96s)]
*  Because it's not true. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5864.8s)]
*  And by the way, you know what he said though, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5865.92s)]
*  if you posted the video, which went viral this two weeks ago, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5867.240000000001s)]
*  people were sharing it all over the place on Twitter, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5870.4800000000005s)]
*  on the bottom, he said he changed his position on this [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5872.620000000001s)]
*  four months ago and no longer supports it. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5875.4400000000005s)]
*  Great, guess what? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5878.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a form of progress reason you're making [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5879.4400000000005s)]
*  that you could say, I was wrong, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5883.080000000001s)]
*  here's where I stand with this now, okay? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5885.04s)]
*  All right, no problem. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5887.32s)]
*  Vaccine, I'm sure you read the Fauci book he wrote [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5889.24s)]
*  an absolute masterpiece of a book he writes. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5892.48s)]
*  Okay, so he's got the COVID community, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5895.44s)]
*  the vaccine community that didn't wanna be forced to take it [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5898.16s)]
*  who doesn't do, don't like Fauci. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5900.4s)]
*  He's got that side. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5902.24s)]
*  I put him as an anti-establishment, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5904.719999999999s)]
*  but I still think he's got a lot of stuff [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5906.62s)]
*  that's on the left as a Democrat, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5908.2s)]
*  even though he's an independent, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5909.799999999999s)]
*  but I think he's a necessary voice. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5911.32s)]
*  I do think he's gonna get in the way though of Trump. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5912.78s)]
*  So the Trump people, I was talking to someone [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5916.64s)]
*  in his orbit several months ago [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5919.12s)]
*  and my instinct was exactly what you just said. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5921.68s)]
*  If you're against the status quo, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5923.72s)]
*  you're by definition not voting for Joe Biden. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5927.200000000001s)]
*  So Kennedy takes, in other words, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5929.84s)]
*  there's nobody who's choosing between Joe Biden [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5931.72s)]
*  and Bobby Kennedy, it's just that person doesn't exist. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5934.280000000001s)]
*  And so by definition, it's gonna take from Trump. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5937.5s)]
*  And the response I got was, oh, he was really liberal [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5939.56s)]
*  on this, that and the other thing, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5941.56s)]
*  or he's really liberal and okay. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5942.38s)]
*  But big picture, it seemed obvious to me, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5944.3s)]
*  that he was gonna hurt Trump. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5947.12s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5948.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5949.679999999999s)]
*  There's no question. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5950.5199999999995s)]
*  So the part which is kind of weird [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5951.339999999999s)]
*  is when Biden's camp doesn't want to give him protection, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5953.96s)]
*  doesn't want to put him on the stage. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5957.36s)]
*  I, again, this goes back to me wondering, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5959.799999999999s)]
*  either you have something up your sleeves [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5964.12s)]
*  or you really think you have such an October surprise [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5966.5599999999995s)]
*  that you're gonna leak to the world [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5970.5599999999995s)]
*  that Bobby's gonna step out [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5972.4s)]
*  like the way they did with Herman Cain, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5973.719999999999s)]
*  nine, nine, nine. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5975.52s)]
*  Oh, I'm gonna have to pause my campaign. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5976.76s)]
*  So maybe there is something that you and I don't know about. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5979.6s)]
*  What's gonna come out? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5982.360000000001s)]
*  The guy's been around for a long time, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5983.200000000001s)]
*  69, 70 year old guy, family, girls, good looking, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5984.240000000001s)]
*  accolades, background, what are they hanging on to [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5987.88s)]
*  that they're not leaking yet? [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5990.240000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5991.34s)]
*  So why are they not afraid of the guy? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5992.18s)]
*  And why are they, these are all things that I wonder [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5994.0s)]
*  on what the left has, the establishment has [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=5997.84s)]
*  that they know they're gonna go after. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6000.64s)]
*  Maybe they're just dumb, they're dumber than we think. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6001.4800000000005s)]
*  I think they're more deceptive than you think. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6003.9s)]
*  Well, they're definitely more deceptive. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6005.78s)]
*  I think they're very- [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6007.259999999999s)]
*  Maybe they believe their own bullshit. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6008.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, the peril of huffing your own fumes [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6009.339999999999s)]
*  of like convincing yourself that Kamala Harris [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6012.58s)]
*  is like impressive or something, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6014.719999999999s)]
*  or that Biden's not seen now. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6016.98s)]
*  I think people are capable of- [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6018.58s)]
*  Do you think that's what it is though? [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6019.42s)]
*  Or you think it's more like it's an easier person [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6020.74s)]
*  to control? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6022.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you look at people who raise money, right? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6023.099999999999s)]
*  Like if you go do a case study of people that ran for, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6024.7s)]
*  who are our top four non-establishment candidates [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6028.0599999999995s)]
*  over the last 70 years, okay? [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6032.64s)]
*  Kennedy, partially Reagan, Trump, and then who else you got? [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6034.84s)]
*  That's non-establishment last 60 years. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6040.92s)]
*  Ross Perot. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6042.12s)]
*  Okay, Ross Perot, that's right. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6042.96s)]
*  Ross Perot got to what, 19 points. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6044.160000000001s)]
*  Reagan, I think 9.6% of the funding for him running [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6047.4800000000005s)]
*  for office was his own money, I think, was that number. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6050.92s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, 100% donor funded. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6053.76s)]
*  Biden, pretty much 100%. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6056.200000000001s)]
*  John F. Kennedy's father, Joseph, I think put 40 [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6059.08s)]
*  or 50% of it. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6061.6s)]
*  Trump, you know how much of it was his in 2016? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6062.84s)]
*  Obama needed other people's, everybody needed [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6065.88s)]
*  other people's money. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6067.68s)]
*  So whoever that needs other people's money [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6068.52s)]
*  is controlled by the other people, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6072.6s)]
*  which is the ideal candidate. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6074.360000000001s)]
*  So Kamala for them is like, that is the ideal person [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6075.88s)]
*  for them, because they can control and say, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6080.080000000001s)]
*  hey, check mark, for the rest of your life, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6081.56s)]
*  your Wikipedia is gonna say vice president. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6084.22s)]
*  Congratulations to you. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6086.64s)]
*  Legacy cemented, we'll make a documentary for you, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6087.64s)]
*  we'll give you a medal of honor, you're good to go. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6090.84s)]
*  Amazing, go make some documentaries [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6093.4800000000005s)]
*  and go to whatever the shows are on [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6095.24s)]
*  and you're gonna be famous. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6097.92s)]
*  Good for you, right? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6098.92s)]
*  That's gone. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6100.52s)]
*  But to me, a part of it, when they're looking [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6102.16s)]
*  at Kamala or Biden, that's their favorite types of candidates. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6104.16s)]
*  They don't like RFKs, are you kidding? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6107.14s)]
*  But she's not, I mean, I think it's fair to say, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6108.6s)]
*  she's not electable on her own. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6110.7s)]
*  No, she's not. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6112.24s)]
*  So if you had to get her out of the way, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6113.860000000001s)]
*  Biden obviously incapacitated by mental decline, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6116.58s)]
*  Kamala repugnant as a person, how do you fix that? [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6119.44s)]
*  For this or 2028, for what? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6124.28s)]
*  For this. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6126.28s)]
*  There's only one person you can do with, only one person. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6127.12s)]
*  Who? [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6129.719999999999s)]
*  It's only Michelle, there's nobody else you can do with. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6130.5599999999995s)]
*  Let's play it out, okay, let's play it out. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6132.36s)]
*  You don't think she's more disgusting? [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6134.419999999999s)]
*  No, to the left, she is the number one person [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6136.12s)]
*  on the leaders bulletin, she's the number one draft pick [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6139.36s)]
*  for the left, maybe even ahead of Newsome, Michelle. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6141.98s)]
*  But let me, again, my opinion, I could be wrong, [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6145.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm just giving you my POV on this. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6147.36s)]
*  Okay, so let's play it, you get rid of Kamala [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6150.04s)]
*  and you put in Newsome, which they would love [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6155.76s)]
*  to have Newsome as a VP and then you transition out, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6157.48s)]
*  well, Biden's gonna be stepping down June of 2025, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6159.4s)]
*  Newsome's now the president. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6162.94s)]
*  What an easy way of getting Newsome elected. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6164.16s)]
*  The easiest way of getting Newsome elected is bring him in. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6166.44s)]
*  But okay, you announce Kamala is stepping down, great. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6168.76s)]
*  What ammunition do you give to the greatest troll [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6173.16s)]
*  of all time on the other side to call you racist? [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6175.679999999999s)]
*  It's done, what's Trump gonna do if you get rid of Kamala [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6178.04s)]
*  and put Newsome in? [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6181.44s)]
*  Look what they did, all they talk about is female power [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6182.44s)]
*  and blacks and all this stuff. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6185.66s)]
*  They put her back on the bus and they replace her [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6187.08s)]
*  with Newsome, shame on the Democrats, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6189.76s)]
*  they're the most racist. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6191.8s)]
*  I mean, can't you already see it? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6193.26s)]
*  Easy, playbook form, right? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6195.24s)]
*  So, but if they bring in instead of Kamala, [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6197.04s)]
*  Kamala comes in and there's not enough time [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6202.24s)]
*  for Supreme Court justice to have a position. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6206.6s)]
*  But say Kamala comes in behind closed doors, say Kamala. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6209.0s)]
*  You come out and you say something's going on [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6213.04s)]
*  with the family, some happen. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6215.64s)]
*  I don't think she has a family, does she? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6218.52s)]
*  Cancer scare, whatever, something's going on. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6220.04s)]
*  Cancer scares are the easiest one, okay? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6222.56s)]
*  Because cancer, everyone's gonna go, oh my God, you know? [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6225.160000000001s)]
*  And hey, God willing, we were able to avoid a chemotherapy [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6227.92s)]
*  and she didn't have to go through it and this is so, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6231.08s)]
*  thank you for all your prayers [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6233.08s)]
*  that none of this stuff happened [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6234.68s)]
*  and they came to me and we were talking [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6236.84s)]
*  and as a collective, I think Newsome is the most qualified. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6239.0s)]
*  That's gonna be problematic, [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6242.2s)]
*  but if you bring Michelle in, that's easy. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6243.24s)]
*  It's a very easy fit to bring her in. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6245.8s)]
*  The question then becomes, does Michelle wanna be a VP? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6248.04s)]
*  Is her ego a VP person? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6250.4s)]
*  Does she wanna come out as a life? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6251.5599999999995s)]
*  But guys, guys, intercede for one sec. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6252.4s)]
*  So she's never had a real job in her life. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6255.5599999999995s)]
*  This is who? [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6258.28s)]
*  Sorry? [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6259.3s)]
*  This is Michelle or Kamala? [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6260.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Michelle. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6260.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6261.8s)]
*  She's like, has nothing in common with any American. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6263.280000000001s)]
*  She's nasty, she's a hater, clearly. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6268.76s)]
*  She's utterly ungrateful for every special advantage [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6271.64s)]
*  she's been given her entire, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6276.0s)]
*  she went to Princeton on a free ride [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6277.0s)]
*  and she's mad at Princeton, really? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6278.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, everything about her is like mediocre, mean, dumb [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6280.200000000001s)]
*  and not a single achievement in her entire life [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6285.38s)]
*  other than marrying this guy in a fake marriage. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6288.38s)]
*  So on what grounds could that person run the country? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6291.52s)]
*  Don't be naive, Tucker. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6295.52s)]
*  You're talking about what I'm saying. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6296.68s)]
*  I can't say yeah. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6298.52s)]
*  You're being super naive, are you kidding me? [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6299.360000000001s)]
*  Do you know which one of these political figures [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6300.68s)]
*  sold 36 million copies of her book? [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6303.120000000001s)]
*  One person. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6307.02s)]
*  Her book about what? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6307.860000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6308.92s)]
*  More whining from a rich lady? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6309.92s)]
*  36 million people bought her book, bro. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6311.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you realize the amount of influence this leads? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6315.400000000001s)]
*  Let's just pause and consider that decision. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6319.44s)]
*  You're walking through Barnes and Noble or Walmart [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6321.5599999999995s)]
*  and you see Michelle Obama's book for sale. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6323.879999999999s)]
*  What causes you to buy something like that? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6326.879999999999s)]
*  You're talking from your perspective? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6330.24s)]
*  Any person, this is a book that she not only didn't write [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6332.04s)]
*  but probably hasn't read. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6334.4s)]
*  Why would you buy something? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6337.16s)]
*  Then you have Michelle Obama's name in your house. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6338.36s)]
*  What signal are you sending? [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6342.28s)]
*  What could possibly compel you to do something like that? [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6343.599999999999s)]
*  You can say all that you want. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6346.599999999999s)]
*  No, but it's true. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6348.16s)]
*  What is that? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6349.44s)]
*  But that's not the point, though. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6350.28s)]
*  The point is she is a rock star for the left. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6351.28s)]
*  She is a rock star for the left. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6355.92s)]
*  She'll be edified and glorified by everybody. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6357.48s)]
*  They love anything that's ugly and bad and mediocre, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6361.52s)]
*  don't they? People have different tastes, man. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6364.8s)]
*  No, but that's not even a taste. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6366.16s)]
*  Look, you could say of Al Sharpton, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6368.12s)]
*  who I vehemently disagree with, [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6370.2s)]
*  but Al Sharpton's a self-created person, actually, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6372.12s)]
*  and Al Sharpton's pretty smart, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6375.3s)]
*  and Al Sharpton's done a lot of things [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6376.92s)]
*  about Al Sharpton that are bad, for sure, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6379.52s)]
*  but at least Al Sharpton's kind of lived a life. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6381.56s)]
*  Michelle Obama, same with Trump. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6385.08s)]
*  Maybe you hate Trump, okay, you think he's vulgar, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6386.68s)]
*  you think of him as, but no, he's a self-created guy, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6388.4400000000005s)]
*  number one TV show in the country. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6391.24s)]
*  Michelle Obama has literally done nothing [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6392.92s)]
*  except whine about the white man for 60 years. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6396.0s)]
*  Like, what? That's not a qualification. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6398.4s)]
*  You're making, you're assuming that doing anything [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6400.4800000000005s)]
*  is a qualification to run on the left. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6404.16s)]
*  I know, but I'm just saying, like, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6406.5599999999995s)]
*  they zero in on the most repulsive images and people. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6407.88s)]
*  It's like they're kind of an x-ray, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6413.44s)]
*  sort of a reverse image of everything [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6416.04s)]
*  that's beautiful and dignified and virtuous. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6418.0599999999995s)]
*  If she runs, you have no idea how formidable she would be. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6420.9s)]
*  But it's like the uglier something is, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6424.62s)]
*  the more they love it. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6426.32s)]
*  Well, maybe that is, again, maybe that's- [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6427.4s)]
*  Physically and spiritually. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6429.08s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6430.719999999999s)]
*  Who is more formidable, her or Joe Biden? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6431.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, probably Michelle, I would think. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6435.24s)]
*  So then the other question becomes for you as- [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6439.24s)]
*  But then you wonder, is there like a bottom to white guilt? [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6441.76s)]
*  Because Michelle Obama's fake husband got him elected [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6444.08s)]
*  because white people got him elected. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6447.44s)]
*  Black people didn't do that. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6450.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6451.4s)]
*  Is that kind of played out? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6452.84s)]
*  Like you're electing, we're gonna say that a woman [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6454.44s)]
*  who lives in Hawaii, compounds in Hawaii [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6456.96s)]
*  and Martha's Vineyard is somehow like, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6459.599999999999s)]
*  it's a victory for civil rights or something? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6462.0s)]
*  What would be the rationale? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6464.68s)]
*  Are we at the end of that cycle [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6466.16s)]
*  where people have to vote for someone like that? [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6467.76s)]
*  So try to, devil's advocate, okay? [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6469.24s)]
*  Let's play devil's advocate. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6472.04s)]
*  You're on the left. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6473.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6474.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6475.22s)]
*  Who are your top five candidates most qualified [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6476.06s)]
*  that you can help as the establishment? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6478.68s)]
*  You get everybody behind this person. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6480.44s)]
*  Who's your top five draft pick on the left to be a president? [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6482.52s)]
*  Jimmy Dore. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6484.92s)]
*  That would never happen on the left. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6487.76s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6490.08s)]
*  You're so fucked. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6490.92s)]
*  But I'm thinking of like the actual left. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6491.76s)]
*  I'd vote for Jimmy Dore. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6492.72s)]
*  Jimmy Dore's a stud. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6494.120000000001s)]
*  He's phenomenal at what he does. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6494.96s)]
*  He's the best, honest man. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6495.8s)]
*  Well think about it, you're them. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6496.64s)]
*  You are them. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6497.96s)]
*  You're in the room with them. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6498.8s)]
*  Who's their top five? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6499.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, I guess, I don't know. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6500.84s)]
*  Who's like mentally retarded and transgender? [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6504.0s)]
*  I guess that's, no, but I'm serious. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6506.900000000001s)]
*  Like that's how they think. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6509.200000000001s)]
*  Like what's the most repulsive thing we can do? [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6510.04s)]
*  What's the opposite of that? [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6513.0s)]
*  What's the farthest from the actual truth? [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6514.96s)]
*  Who's the least competent? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6516.76s)]
*  You know, what's the ugliest building we can build? [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6518.240000000001s)]
*  What's the most putrid painting we can create [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6520.080000000001s)]
*  and call it art? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6522.360000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't say Newsome, number one, Michelle, two. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6523.84s)]
*  You wouldn't go to some of those. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6526.04s)]
*  You wouldn't go Gretchen. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6527.4s)]
*  You wouldn't put that as a top five. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6529.88s)]
*  That's their profile of candidates. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6531.72s)]
*  That's the profile of their. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6533.98s)]
*  But like those people are jokes. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6534.82s)]
*  I mean. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6536.4s)]
*  It's not about being a joke. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6537.24s)]
*  It's about who they can control [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6538.0599999999995s)]
*  and get the job done through them. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6539.08s)]
*  But what's the job? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6540.8s)]
*  Well, are you kidding me? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6542.44s)]
*  Establish certain controls that nobody can touch. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6543.599999999999s)]
*  Just steal shit. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6548.28s)]
*  Just steal shit. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6549.28s)]
*  Sure. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6550.12s)]
*  That's basically what it is. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6550.94s)]
*  Like let the stealing proceed. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6551.78s)]
*  Well, I mean, without getting caught [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6552.8s)]
*  and you create the law. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6555.12s)]
*  I mean, if you create the law, you're protecting yourself. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6556.08s)]
*  Oh, I've noticed. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6558.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6559.240000000001s)]
*  So by the way, are you following closely [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6560.06s)]
*  what's going on with Iran, with Raisi? [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6561.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, to the extent you can know, yeah. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6563.6s)]
*  I mean, I've certainly followed it. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6565.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6566.280000000001s)]
*  Are you seeing like a. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6567.12s)]
*  Just another aircraft crash. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6568.96s)]
*  Just a kind of tragic accident. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6571.6s)]
*  It happens all the time to presidents [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6573.12s)]
*  of different countries. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6574.56s)]
*  It seems to. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6575.400000000001s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6576.240000000001s)]
*  What do you think it is behind? [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6577.06s)]
*  I have some thoughts, but what do you think it is? [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6577.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's either [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6579.2s)]
*  an internal power struggle. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6581.24s)]
*  We talked about this last night. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6584.28s)]
*  And within Iran or it's the US or Israel [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6586.2s)]
*  or a combination of those two. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6591.12s)]
*  I mean, those are the obvious suspects. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6592.639999999999s)]
*  I don't know the answer. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6594.16s)]
*  So do you know who Mojtapa Khamenei is? [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6595.4s)]
*  Sort of, yeah. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6598.639999999999s)]
*  We talked about last night. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6599.48s)]
*  So he's the second oldest son of the supreme leader Khamenei. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6600.32s)]
*  Do you know what his net worth is? [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6605.32s)]
*  His, just the son's net worth. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6606.599999999999s)]
*  Hundreds of millions, I would think. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6607.72s)]
*  $3 billion. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6608.84s)]
*  $3 billion? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6609.68s)]
*  Type it in, you'll see it. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6610.52s)]
*  It's $3 billion. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6611.64s)]
*  Now this is reports that are coming in, what he's worth. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6612.4800000000005s)]
*  Now how is he worth $3 billion? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6614.240000000001s)]
*  Because he started Twitter. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6616.160000000001s)]
*  Well, because he's, of course. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6617.320000000001s)]
*  He's just an energetic, innovative man. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6618.56s)]
*  Unbelievable entrepreneur. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6620.6s)]
*  Very innovative. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6622.200000000001s)]
*  He created the Facebook of Iran, right? [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6623.040000000001s)]
*  But so this guy is in the running [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6625.84s)]
*  to be the next supreme leader of Iran. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6629.9800000000005s)]
*  There's two candidates. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6633.68s)]
*  There is Ibrahim Raisi and there is Khamenei's son. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6635.400000000001s)]
*  Now Khamenei's family has been estimated [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6640.68s)]
*  to have a net worth of roughly $200 billion. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6644.280000000001s)]
*  Khamenei's family. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6647.0s)]
*  How they accumulated that, who knows? [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6648.56s)]
*  Some of the most innovative people in the world, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6650.8s)]
*  apparently, to get to $200 billion. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6652.52s)]
*  Innovatively stealing money from taxpayers, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6654.56s)]
*  innovatively getting money from different places, [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6657.040000000001s)]
*  but regardless, it's innovative on what they've done, right? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6659.4800000000005s)]
*  Why would this family, ultimate nepotism, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6662.56s)]
*  why would they want Raisi to become the supreme leader? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6665.72s)]
*  Fair, fair. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6668.080000000001s)]
*  So you have to give a little bit of credibility. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6669.0s)]
*  I do. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6671.36s)]
*  Because in the past, Raf Sanjani, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6672.2s)]
*  which we kind of talked about last night, [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6673.72s)]
*  Raf Sanjani was a guy that died at 82 years old [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6675.8s)]
*  as the president and he died from a heart attack. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6679.68s)]
*  That's not what his family believes on what happened to him. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6684.2s)]
*  So it's very easy for us right off the bat [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6686.64s)]
*  to say, oh, it's Israel. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6689.56s)]
*  Oh, it's US. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6690.6s)]
*  Oh, you know what? [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6692.16s)]
*  If US wouldn't put the sanctions on us, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6693.0s)]
*  we would have better helicopters [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6694.84s)]
*  where this wouldn't happen whatever city was in taboos. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6696.16s)]
*  I got it, yeah. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6698.12s)]
*  But Iran going through that with some of their power plays [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6700.08s)]
*  they're gonna be going through today with Khomeini, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6703.84s)]
*  it's gonna be interesting to see. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6705.72s)]
*  I mean, assassinating, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6707.44s)]
*  a sovereign state assassinating [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6709.0s)]
*  the leader of another sovereign state, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6710.72s)]
*  not a good precedent to set, not a good idea. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6712.68s)]
*  Almost no matter who it is, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6714.8s)]
*  we didn't try to, we didn't assassinate Hitler, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6715.64s)]
*  we didn't assassinate Stalin, we didn't assassinate Mao. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6717.08s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6719.44s)]
*  that you probably don't wanna get into the assassinations game [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6720.76s)]
*  because you don't know where it's gonna wind up. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6722.88s)]
*  And it's reckless, super reckless behavior. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6724.76s)]
*  So I like to believe, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6728.4800000000005s)]
*  I wanna believe what you just said, [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6730.24s)]
*  that does sound like an absolute possibility. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6731.8s)]
*  And I don't wanna believe that states [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6734.72s)]
*  are knocking off one another's leaders [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6737.88s)]
*  because again, you don't know where that winds up. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6740.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, maybe there should be a kind of informal agreement [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6745.400000000001s)]
*  not to assassinate each other. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6748.6s)]
*  Oh, and yeah, for sure. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6750.24s)]
*  And not to do it internally, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6752.360000000001s)]
*  but again, you go back and play the ambitions game. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6753.44s)]
*  Well, internally is a totally different game. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6755.32s)]
*  This could be a game of ambition [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6757.24s)]
*  of who wants to control the Iran's, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6758.839999999999s)]
*  the resources for many, many years to come. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6762.28s)]
*  And this guy was only 63 years old. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6764.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6767.28s)]
*  Raisi when he passed away. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6768.12s)]
*  This is not a... [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6768.94s)]
*  And the six other guys too. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6769.78s)]
*  Right, so... [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6770.599999999999s)]
*  Does the US wind up in a war with Iran? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6772.719999999999s)]
*  It's looking like it. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6775.36s)]
*  It does look like it. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6776.36s)]
*  It's looking like it that we're about to go there. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6777.2s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6778.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not as worried about it with Iran [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6780.16s)]
*  for a couple of different reasons. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6786.12s)]
*  Iran, now here's the thing. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6788.56s)]
*  I'll give you both sides of it. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6789.8s)]
*  The part that I'm not worried about it, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6792.16s)]
*  Iran's always been, when Trump took out Ghassam Soleimani, [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6793.76s)]
*  who was the number two guy at the time, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6798.4s)]
*  this is the guy that was leading pretty much all the proxy wars [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6799.68s)]
*  and all the proxy military, Hezbollah, Houthi. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6802.68s)]
*  This is a very, very legit power player, Soleimani. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6805.0s)]
*  So you take him out and you say, I took him out. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6808.96s)]
*  I did it. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6811.64s)]
*  My name is Trump, I took him out. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6812.84s)]
*  In your face, right? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6814.56s)]
*  There's no way we're gonna let Trump and America [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6816.9800000000005s)]
*  get away with it. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6819.24s)]
*  Watch what we're gonna be doing. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6820.08s)]
*  They intentionally threw some missiles [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6821.76s)]
*  in an area where there was no soldiers. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6824.12s)]
*  So nothing happened. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6826.16s)]
*  But then they're like, look at us, we showed strength. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6827.36s)]
*  No, you really didn't. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6829.400000000001s)]
*  Now what's changed from Soleimani till today? [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6831.32s)]
*  A lot. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6834.16s)]
*  A lot. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6835.0s)]
*  The world has changed. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6835.82s)]
*  It's a five year, $400 billion contract [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6836.66s)]
*  from US's number one enemy called China. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6839.54s)]
*  It's during the same time, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6843.9s)]
*  Russia had an okay relationship with US. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6847.099999999999s)]
*  Now we're in a proxy war with Russia [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6849.86s)]
*  through Ukraine that we're funding left and right. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6853.34s)]
*  But we're in a direct war. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6856.18s)]
*  I mean, there are US military personnel [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6857.099999999999s)]
*  fighting Russia from Ukraine. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6858.42s)]
*  Well, I wanna be a little bit more diplomatic. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6860.54s)]
*  Well, it's just true. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6863.66s)]
*  I don't think the average person understands [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6865.0599999999995s)]
*  just how crazy this has gotten. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6867.34s)]
*  On how deep we are there, right? [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6868.42s)]
*  Okay, so then Russia's gonna side with who? [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6870.3s)]
*  With us or Iran, their neighbor, Caspian Sea. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6873.22s)]
*  Who are they gonna side with? [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6876.7s)]
*  So this is the part where you're kinda like, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6878.22s)]
*  so Iran is no longer Iran. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6881.66s)]
*  Iran is essentially one of the eyes in bricks. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6883.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6886.94s)]
*  Exactly. India, Iran. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6888.34s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6889.26s)]
*  So going up, remember the story I told you about earlier? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6891.06s)]
*  Then it escalates from regional conflict to world war, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6894.06s)]
*  conceivably, very fast. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6897.14s)]
*  We're already in world war, just like nobody wants to say it. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6898.580000000001s)]
*  We were already in a recession, a year and a half ago. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6900.9800000000005s)]
*  How unnecessary is all this? [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6902.900000000001s)]
*  How insane is all this? [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6904.620000000001s)]
*  How does this help my family, my country? [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6905.900000000001s)]
*  It doesn't help your family, your country, [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6908.34s)]
*  but you have to go back to who the customer is. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6909.740000000001s)]
*  In order for the military contractors to make money, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6911.9800000000005s)]
*  they need wars. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6915.42s)]
*  In order for many of these other business models [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6916.9400000000005s)]
*  to make money, they need crisis. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6919.9800000000005s)]
*  In order for a vanguard or a black rock [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6922.46s)]
*  to get a $400 billion, I think it's vanguard, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6928.1s)]
*  but I do know it's black rock, [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6930.58s)]
*  to get a $400 billion contract to rebuild Ukraine, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6931.66s)]
*  you need Ukraine to be destroyed to rebuild it. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6936.38s)]
*  If Ukraine is in destroyed, you don't need to rebuild. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6938.62s)]
*  These are all great business models for these folks. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6941.42s)]
*  But you know how it ends. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6944.9s)]
*  I mean, it ends with the destruction of everything [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6947.54s)]
*  that's worth having, actually. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6949.82s)]
*  Only if they keep the power. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6952.9400000000005s)]
*  Only if they keep the power. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6956.58s)]
*  But they can't foresee the future. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6957.860000000001s)]
*  These are not people with fine motor skills. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6959.9400000000005s)]
*  They overstate their own power and foresight. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6962.58s)]
*  And once you get into something like this, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6965.780000000001s)]
*  you have no fucking idea where it ends. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6967.780000000001s)]
*  You have no idea. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6970.5s)]
*  Things can go sideways so fast, you can't control events. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6971.780000000001s)]
*  You think you can, you can't. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6974.700000000001s)]
*  That's true in your family, and it's true geopolitically. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6976.38s)]
*  And so like, you think you've got it all fine tuned, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6979.9s)]
*  it's like some Rube Goldberg thing. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6983.9s)]
*  And then this happens, that happens. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6985.179999999999s)]
*  And what we're gonna do is, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6986.58s)]
*  we're gonna kick Russia out of Swift, [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6988.219999999999s)]
*  and actually that will cause internal revolt within Russia, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6989.82s)]
*  and they'll depose Putin. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6992.9s)]
*  And it's like, you can't game this stuff out. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6994.58s)]
*  There are too many variables. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6997.5s)]
*  And you could easily wind up in a nuclear exchange. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=6998.54s)]
*  What do you think their insurance policy is? [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7000.82s)]
*  You think they sit down and worry about what's- [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7002.5s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7003.339999999999s)]
*  I hope they have submarines, because I don't know how. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7004.299999999999s)]
*  I think they're actually destroying [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7007.5s)]
*  the country that they live in. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7010.06s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7011.66s)]
*  And that's why I think it's supernatural. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7012.860000000001s)]
*  It's psychotic to me. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7014.82s)]
*  It's delusional to be able to do that. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7015.9400000000005s)]
*  But in their minds, they're protected. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7017.3s)]
*  In their minds, they're protected. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7020.38s)]
*  In their minds, not- [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7022.26s)]
*  By their wealth? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7023.1s)]
*  Yeah, in their minds. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7024.54s)]
*  These people are so stupid. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7025.38s)]
*  Money worshipers are so stupid. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7026.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, my wealth will protect me. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7028.66s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7030.02s)]
*  How many people have thought that? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7031.66s)]
*  A lot. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7034.02s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein thought that. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7034.860000000001s)]
*  Everybody thinks that. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7035.82s)]
*  That's the lie of wealth. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7036.82s)]
*  It's gonna protect you. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7037.94s)]
*  Diddy's like, oh, they're not gonna do anything to me. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7038.78s)]
*  Watch what's gonna happen to Diddy next. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7040.38s)]
*  Did you see his apology video? [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7042.22s)]
*  I haven't been following the Diddy. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7043.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, they showed the video of, [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7045.34s)]
*  I know you probably obviously probably listen [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7047.139999999999s)]
*  to a lot of hip hop. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7048.98s)]
*  You give me the vibes of it. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7049.82s)]
*  I do, yeah. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7050.66s)]
*  Aficionado. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7051.5s)]
*  Yeah, I can totally see it. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7052.46s)]
*  So Diddy is, the video comes out of him beating Cassie, [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7053.34s)]
*  his ex-girlfriend, that within 24 hours, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7059.38s)]
*  they settle for $30 million, [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7061.98s)]
*  and that story was gone like a year ago or something like that. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7063.42s)]
*  So finally the video comes out. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7066.18s)]
*  From 2016, this video, he's hitting her in the head, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7067.780000000001s)]
*  pulling her hair, dragging her middle of the hotel. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7071.34s)]
*  Who beats women? [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7073.900000000001s)]
*  I don't want it to be racist or anything, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7075.26s)]
*  but you're not supposed to beat women, right? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7077.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7078.58s)]
*  Well, Diddy a few years ago was commenting on Chris Brown [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7079.46s)]
*  and Rihanna's controversy on Ellen DeGeneres, [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7084.3s)]
*  and he says, you know, let's just pray for them. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7086.54s)]
*  Because we don't know what they're going through. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7088.46s)]
*  Let's pray for them before we assume [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7089.5s)]
*  what they're going through. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7090.860000000001s)]
*  Let's just pray for them. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7091.700000000001s)]
*  So maybe that's what he's going through right now, [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7092.52s)]
*  and then they leaked the video. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7094.54s)]
*  So all these guys who grew up with single mothers [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7095.86s)]
*  and are really mad at women, sorry. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7097.46s)]
*  Yeah, have you seen the numbers [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7100.0199999999995s)]
*  of how we went from single mothers in 1960 to today? [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7101.259999999999s)]
*  The matriarchy leads to wife beating. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7105.099999999999s)]
*  I'm just telling you that. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7108.74s)]
*  A man with a strong father does not beat women. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7110.179999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7111.94s)]
*  You can't beat women. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7112.78s)]
*  You don't send them off to fight your wars. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7113.599999999999s)]
*  You don't beat them up. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7114.44s)]
*  You treat them with respect. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7116.339999999999s)]
*  That's the man who grew up [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7117.74s)]
*  in a household with a strong father. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7119.179999999999s)]
*  The man who grew up in a household with a mom, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7120.98s)]
*  loving but also arbitrary and flaky, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7124.219999999999s)]
*  that guy hates women. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7127.82s)]
*  He becomes a womanizer, not in a fun way, [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7129.7s)]
*  in a bad way. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7132.299999999999s)]
*  Abusive way. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7134.0199999999995s)]
*  Abusive, exploits women, and then he beats them up. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7134.86s)]
*  And there's a direct connection. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7137.839999999999s)]
*  You're not gonna find many wife beaters [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7140.139999999999s)]
*  who grew up with a strong dad at home, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7141.919999999999s)]
*  but you'll find a ton who grew up with mom. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7143.74s)]
*  So it's one of the many ironies [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7146.5s)]
*  that we don't acknowledge, but we should acknowledge it. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7150.0599999999995s)]
*  If you care about preventing violence against women, [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7151.74s)]
*  encourage two-parent families with real dads. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7154.74s)]
*  Don't fight the patriarchy. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7158.0199999999995s)]
*  Embrace the patriarchy, and you get less wife beating. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7159.0599999999995s)]
*  So you can... [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7161.98s)]
*  That's so hurt. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7162.82s)]
*  So by the way... [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7163.98s)]
*  Am I right? [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7164.82s)]
*  I'm just taking a check with your wife. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7165.86s)]
*  For sure, yeah. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7167.099999999999s)]
*  So by the way, when you process it that way, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7167.94s)]
*  that goes back to me thinking we need to change incentives [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7170.62s)]
*  because in 1960, only 4% of kids were born [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7173.7s)]
*  to a unwed mother, like a single mother. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7177.74s)]
*  Today it's 41%, from 4% to 41%. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7180.66s)]
*  That's not liberation, you don't think? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7184.62s)]
*  Oh, you kid me, that's catastrophic. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7186.28s)]
*  That's problematic. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7189.26s)]
*  But that's what fighting the patriarchy looks like. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7190.099999999999s)]
*  Beating up women and mugging them on the street, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7192.68s)]
*  sending them off to fight your stupid wars. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7194.82s)]
*  But listen, they're not selling family values, [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7197.62s)]
*  they're not selling having kids, [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7200.18s)]
*  they're not selling the value of raising a kid, [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7201.26s)]
*  they're not selling. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7203.9s)]
*  The incentive program is created to be divorced, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7204.74s)]
*  to stay single, to keep having kids, [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7208.62s)]
*  to stay on welfare, the incentive program is created [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7210.66s)]
*  for me to stay entitled for my entire life [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7214.099999999999s)]
*  relying on some kind of welfare. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7216.74s)]
*  And by the way, both you and I have four kids, right? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7218.18s)]
*  We were talking about it last night, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7220.9s)]
*  four kids, I got four kids. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7222.14s)]
*  Crazy number for you. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7223.62s)]
*  I wish I had eight, but yeah. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7224.46s)]
*  I wish I had 20. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7225.5s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7226.54s)]
*  We'll revisit the polygamy thing. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7227.38s)]
*  Well, we can, again, if we have new policies, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7229.74s)]
*  we can potentially consider that, right? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7232.54s)]
*  I tell my wife, I'd keep her pregnant, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7235.0599999999995s)]
*  she'd have a three month break every year, [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7237.32s)]
*  and we'd be pregnant for 20 years. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7239.16s)]
*  She'd be pregnant for 20. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7240.599999999999s)]
*  It sounds like fun. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7241.44s)]
*  But can you imagine going to dinner? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7242.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we'd like to make a reservation for dinner tonight. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7243.759999999999s)]
*  How big's your party? [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7245.599999999999s)]
*  Party of 24. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7246.44s)]
*  I love that. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7247.28s)]
*  I'd love that. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7248.099999999999s)]
*  You sit at the end of the patriarch, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7248.94s)]
*  all the little pups lying down on the other side. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7251.5599999999995s)]
*  You're assuming they don't have girlfriends or boyfriends, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7253.719999999999s)]
*  so maybe it's like party of 40. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7255.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7256.759999999999s)]
*  Hey, let's just shut down the restaurant. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7257.599999999999s)]
*  I love that. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7258.92s)]
*  I wanna be a Bedouin tribal leader. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7259.759999999999s)]
*  I love that. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7261.759999999999s)]
*  Hitting the hubbly bubbly in my tent. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7262.599999999999s)]
*  Check this out. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7267.84s)]
*  Watch this, crazy data. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7268.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7269.92s)]
*  Crazy data, you ready? [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7270.76s)]
*  So in 1960, every year, 4.3 million kids are born in 1960. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7271.6s)]
*  Every year in 1960, 1.7 million people roughly die every year. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7281.7s)]
*  4.3 born, 1.7 die. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7289.36s)]
*  It's a net positive of 2.6 million. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7294.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7297.2s)]
*  You're with me so far. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7298.04s)]
*  1960. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7298.86s)]
*  1960. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7299.7s)]
*  Then you murder a president. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7300.54s)]
*  That's right. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7302.04s)]
*  Four years later, so come to today, that number. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7303.0s)]
*  Number of kids being born, roughly, [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7306.74s)]
*  number of kids being born, 3.2, 3.3 million. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7310.92s)]
*  Number of people dying, 2.7, 2.8 million. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7314.8s)]
*  We went from 2.6 million more people being born [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7319.08s)]
*  than dying to only 500,000 more people being born than dying. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7324.34s)]
*  Fertility rate lowest ever in America, 1.6. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7329.74s)]
*  We have, there's this new trend, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7335.82s)]
*  I don't know if you've considered joining it or not. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7337.54s)]
*  It is a little rebellious if you're thinking about it. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7340.26s)]
*  This community called the LGBTQ community. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7343.139999999999s)]
*  They attract rebellious people. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7345.88s)]
*  You get to do whatever you wanted. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7347.22s)]
*  You get to cut things off. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7348.34s)]
*  It's actually very interesting what's happening with it. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7349.26s)]
*  It's a new hot thing. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7351.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you're following it or not. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7352.0199999999995s)]
*  Sounds like fun. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7352.86s)]
*  Obviously, that's gonna prevent from having kids [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7353.86s)]
*  because if you cut your dangling off, it's hard to have kids. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7355.66s)]
*  But I'm sure that's not part of the plan or anything. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7357.82s)]
*  No, that would never do such a thing. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7359.5s)]
*  It's a noble thing. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7360.339999999999s)]
*  But you look at this, to me, there's a lot of numbers [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7362.219999999999s)]
*  we can look at that's concerning. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7364.219999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7522.1s)]

*  we're up 780%, the whole thing with Manect is, [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7524.86s)]
*  eight years ago, I call a lawyer, [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7527.98s)]
*  I have a seven minute call with him, [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7530.46s)]
*  he bills me for 30 minutes. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7531.82s)]

*  I have the number here, he had a seven minute call. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7535.179999999999s)]
*  He says, minutes roll up. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7538.099999999999s)]
*  I said, not to 30 minutes, maybe to 10 minutes. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7539.0199999999995s)]
*  He says, no, it's 30 minutes. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7541.66s)]
*  I said, what do you charge by the minute? [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7543.58s)]
*  He says, no lawyer charges by the minute. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7544.98s)]
*  I said, one day I'm gonna create a website or an app [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7547.0599999999995s)]
*  that I get to pay people by the minute. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7548.94s)]
*  So, do you have a minute to connect? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7551.94s)]
*  Let's Manect. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7554.58s)]
*  So whereas most places you email somebody [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7555.9s)]
*  and the response rate, a cold email is 1%, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7559.66s)]
*  less than 1% that someone's gonna like, [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7561.98s)]
*  somebody called response, hey Tucker, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7563.54s)]
*  I'd love to talk to you about a job. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7565.299999999999s)]
*  What's the chances of you getting back [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7566.58s)]
*  to that person and email? [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7567.66s)]
*  Probably slim to none, right? [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7568.82s)]
*  I don't do email, so yeah, pretty low. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7570.259999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7571.62s)]
*  On Instagram, it's 3% response rate, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7572.46s)]
*  on Twitter it's five, on LinkedIn it's 8%. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7575.099999999999s)]
*  On Manect, you're paying to get a respond back. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7578.0199999999995s)]
*  So you're paying a person $50, $100, $300, $500, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7581.42s)]
*  and they respond back to you [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7586.02s)]
*  because you're respecting their time. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7587.54s)]
*  Our response rate right now is 94% they get back to you, [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7589.22s)]
*  and over 50% of the time they get back to you [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7593.9s)]
*  within 24 hours. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7595.86s)]
*  So we have the consulting, we have the product development, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7597.18s)]
*  we have the media side. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7600.34s)]
*  On the media side, I think the media landscape right now [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7601.42s)]
*  is wide open, it's filled with a lot of talented people, [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7606.54s)]
*  some that are driven by money, [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7610.7s)]
*  some that are driven by fame, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7612.5s)]
*  a few that are driven by values and principles, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7614.26s)]
*  we're driven by values and principles and a vision, [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7616.62s)]
*  and it's pure conviction. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7618.66s)]
*  It's not like I need another nice car, [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7619.74s)]
*  I need another nice house, [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7623.42s)]
*  or I need not have much money in the bank, no. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7624.54s)]
*  This is, we have a real vision, a real cause [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7627.46s)]
*  that we're gonna go for 40 years, [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7629.7s)]
*  and I think at the end of the day, [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7630.86s)]
*  10, 20, 30 years down the line, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7632.66s)]
*  they're gonna look at this thing and say, [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7633.98s)]
*  oh wow, this is one of the most influential companies [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7635.0199999999995s)]
*  in the world, that's what we're gonna be doing. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7636.78s)]
*  So just, I can't assess the rest, though, congratulations, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7638.42s)]
*  but I can sort of assess the media part [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7642.7s)]
*  of just having worked in it, [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7644.38s)]
*  and we are at a pivot point, for sure. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7646.06s)]
*  All of a sudden, you have all these independent voices, [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7650.42s)]
*  some of them bigger than the established voices, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7652.7s)]
*  because legacy media is obviously dying. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7656.38s)]
*  But do those independent media figures [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7660.18s)]
*  come together at some point? [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7663.62s)]
*  If they did, are you kidding me? [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7666.02s)]
*  I mean, that would be very intimidating [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7668.860000000001s)]
*  if that was to happen. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7670.18s)]
*  Because the market wants everything divided, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7671.9400000000005s)]
*  that's what the enemy wants. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7675.54s)]
*  The enemy wants everybody divided. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7677.06s)]
*  They can bully and push around if you're divided, [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7679.06s)]
*  because you can't build a household influential thing [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7681.46s)]
*  if you're divided. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7685.54s)]
*  If we can bring everybody together, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7687.02s)]
*  and Cicero said one of the problems why empires fall [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7689.54s)]
*  is because everybody wants to know who got the most credit. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7691.700000000001s)]
*  I did it. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7694.42s)]
*  No, if it wasn't for me, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7695.22s)]
*  and that's the challenge with sometimes people [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7696.46s)]
*  on the conservative side, everybody wants the credit. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7698.54s)]
*  So if some of these guys can unite and work together, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7701.3s)]
*  the enemy's not gonna like that. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7707.62s)]
*  That's gonna be very, very scary for the enemy, [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7709.34s)]
*  because they're not used to that. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7713.06s)]
*  They're used to dividing and pinning everybody [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7714.42s)]
*  against everyone. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7716.54s)]
*  It's an easy art of war, sunsuits, nothing new, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7717.5s)]
*  divide and conquer easily, they do it all the time. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7720.34s)]
*  But if some of these guys can set aside their egos [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7723.1s)]
*  and find a way where each can individually win [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7725.58s)]
*  and collectively win, game over. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7729.18s)]
*  It's gonna be a fun next 10, 20 years. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7731.06s)]

*  Some of my earliest memories [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7752.66s)]
*  are my parents playing this game. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7754.74s)]
*  Let me get my eyeglasses, because I can't see as well. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7756.58s)]
*  No, I don't feel. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7759.98s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ho! [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7760.82s)]
*  Let's get you to play. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7762.54s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpeqjOGLdo&t=7763.54s)]
