# Here's What Really Happened on January 6th
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28)
*  It has been exactly three years since January 6th, the events of January 6th, the racist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=0.0s)]
*  insurrection that shocked this nation to its core more profoundly than anything since Pearl [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=6.5s)]
*  Harbor plus the Civil War. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=12.26s)]
*  And it has taken a while, honestly, even for people who aren't on the side of the professional [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=15.74s)]
*  liars to realize there's something amiss about what happened that day, not just the response, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=20.82s)]
*  the largest law enforcement mobilization in the history of the United States. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=25.98s)]
*  That was obviously disproportionate because it wasn't the worst riot that year, not even [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=29.02s)]
*  closed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=33.32s)]
*  But the day itself, there was something about January 6th that didn't feel right. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=34.32s)]
*  And hovering over that day has remained the question to what extent was it a setup? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=38.82s)]
*  And we still don't really know. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  But what's interesting is how few people have asked that entirely legitimate question. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=46.7s)]
*  One of the very few, really one of the only in the United States Congress, is a member [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=50.3s)]
*  called Clay Higgins from Louisiana. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  And in case you haven't seen this clip, it's worth rewatching. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=57.300000000000004s)]
*  This is from 2022 in a Homeland Security committee hearing where he asked it just directly of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=60.18000000000001s)]
*  the FBI director. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  Did the FBI have confidential human sources embedded within the January 6th protesters [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  on January 6th of 2021? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=77.58s)]
*  Well, Congressman, as I'm sure you can appreciate, I have to be very careful about what I can [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=79.94s)]
*  say about when. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to say it now because that's what you told us two years ago. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=86.14s)]
*  May I finish? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=89.22s)]
*  About when we do and do not and where we have and have not used confidential human sources. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=90.86s)]
*  But to the extent that there's a suggestion, for example, that the FBI is confidential [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=96.02s)]
*  human sources or FBI employees in some way instigated or orchestrated January 6th, that's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=100.58s)]
*  categorically false. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=105.98s)]
*  Did you have confidential human sources dressed as Trump supporters inside the Capitol on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=106.98s)]
*  January 6th prior to the doors being open? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=112.02s)]
*  Again, I had to be very careful. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=115.34s)]
*  It should be a no. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=116.86s)]
*  Can you not tell the American people? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=118.54s)]
*  No, we did not have confidential human sources dressed as Trump supporters positioned inside [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=126.06s)]
*  Gentlemen, you should not read anything into my decision not to share information. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=127.06s)]
*  Director Ray, gentlemen, time has expired. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=133.3s)]
*  What a sleazy, repulsive little authoritarian liar Chris Ray is. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=136.82s)]
*  That's obvious when you watch that tape. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=140.86s)]
*  The sad part is so few tapes like that exist because so few have confronted him directly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=143.14s)]
*  and asked questions to which the entire country has a right to know the answer like that one. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=147.34s)]
*  Clay Higgins did that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  Congressman from Louisiana, Lafayette, joins us in studio. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=156.7s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Tuck. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=158.62s)]
*  So that was over a year ago that you asked that question, which is a central question, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=159.82s)]
*  and you asked it as I think is appropriate without any embarrassment at all on behalf [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  of your constituents and the rest of the country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=167.14s)]
*  Are you any closer to the answer now? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=169.74s)]
*  Well, we're closer to being in a position where we can reveal the answers that we already have. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=173.18s)]
*  Much of the evidence that we have compiled from investigative effort over the course [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=182.38s)]
*  of the last couple of years, some offices like my own, what I've operated in silos [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  of investigative endeavor have now been able to come together now that we have a Republican [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=198.02s)]
*  majority and we have access to the staffs of the appropriate investigative committees. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=205.22s)]
*  And so I sit on the oversight committee and Republicans run that committee now, therefore [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=213.34s)]
*  we control the staff. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=219.3s)]
*  So when you can magnify the efforts that individual members of Congress have pushed within our [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=221.02s)]
*  own offices, when you can magnify those efforts by the skill and the numbers of staff from [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=230.06s)]
*  the committees, you get a lot of evidence reviewed professionally and aligned and assembled [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  into essentially a case file. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=244.38s)]
*  And in this case, this is a big file. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=247.22s)]
*  Because the involvement of certain actors, you could say deep state actors within the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=250.86s)]
*  federal government to set the stage for what happened in J-4, 5, and 6, and to entrap thousands [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=260.54s)]
*  of Americans from across the country and allure them into this set stage on J-4, 5, and 6. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=273.3s)]
*  The people that were involved in that is quite a large web. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=282.5s)]
*  So yes sir, we do have a great deal of evidence compiled and we're gradually, professionally [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=287.70000000000005s)]
*  rolling that evidence out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=297.38000000000005s)]
*  So you sort of answered the question right there in larger terms. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=299.94s)]
*  You just said that elements within the federal government, I assume law enforcement, intel, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=303.14000000000004s)]
*  and military, and I'm using your words, lured Americans to Washington into what you called [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=307.22s)]
*  a trap. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  Yes sir. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  So that would, I mean that's a shocking, and I assume that's a sober conclusion based on [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  the evidence. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  That would be my sober assessment as an investigator. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=324.97999999999996s)]
*  And I'm quite a, I love my country and I've always been a staunch defender of the thin [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=329.97999999999996s)]
*  blue line. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  And I would proudly count the FBI amongst that number. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=339.7s)]
*  It's like brothers to me. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  So to find that level of conspiratorial corruption at the highest levels of the FBI has been [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=345.41999999999996s)]
*  very troubling to me as a man, as a cop. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=354.82s)]
*  And yet, you follow the evidence wherever it leads. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=358.98s)]
*  And this is what investigators do. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=363.09999999999997s)]
*  So when I asked Christopher Wray that question, for instance, I already knew the answer. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=365.42s)]
*  I had reviewed compelling evidence that the FBI had assets, human assets, dressed as Trump [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=372.7s)]
*  supporters inside the Capitol prior to the doors being opened and the masses allowed [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=381.85999999999996s)]
*  in. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=388.41999999999996s)]
*  So I knew that the FBI was deeply involved. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=389.41999999999996s)]
*  I'd seen evidence even at that time with that the FBI had embedded themselves into various [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=395.97999999999996s)]
*  groups online across the country of Americans who were essentially voicing their concerns [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=403.78000000000003s)]
*  and airing their grievances with each other about COVID oppression. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  Those Americans were targeted by the FBI, almost universally, Republicans and largely [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=417.38s)]
*  Trump supporters. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=425.26s)]
*  The FBI worked undercover to infiltrate those conversations and become a significant part [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=427.34000000000003s)]
*  of those individual Americans' communications. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=436.86s)]
*  And when you dig into the evidence that we've had revealed through some criminal cases that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=441.38s)]
*  I've followed and work with the families of J6 political detainees and Americans that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=447.94s)]
*  have been persecuted for their involvement in the Capitol that day, some of that evidence [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=457.46s)]
*  shockingly reveals that the FBI agents that were operating undercover within the online [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=463.46s)]
*  groups across the country were the first ones to plant the seeds of suggestions of a more [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=471.74s)]
*  radical occupation of the Capitol. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=482.74s)]
*  And they were sort of testing the waters of who amongst that group would begin acknowledging [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=486.74s)]
*  that, you know, yeah, maybe we should do that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=495.74s)]
*  Maybe we should plan for an occupation like that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=500.54s)]
*  But if you look at the origins of those conversations, they were started by the FBI undercover guy [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=503.46s)]
*  that was operating inside the group. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=510.7s)]
*  And then months later, on January 4th, 5th, and 6th, many of those Americans met for the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=512.9s)]
*  first time in person when they gathered for the massive rally where American patriots [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=520.7s)]
*  assembled to object to everything that had happened during 2020, the COVID oppression [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=528.1s)]
*  and the stunning results of what we believe was a compromise election cycle in November [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=534.1s)]
*  2020. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=541.9s)]
*  So Americans gathered at their own Capitol to appropriately air grievances and protests [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=542.9s)]
*  at their Capitol, but embedded amongst their number was an FBI asset that had been working [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=551.62s)]
*  from within their group online for many months. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=559.14s)]
*  So this was the level of manipulative effort that the FBI invested into American citizenry [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=562.94s)]
*  and our assembly online to exercise our rights under the First Amendment, to talk to each [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=575.22s)]
*  other about whatever we want to talk about, including the insidious oppressions of COVID [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=583.22s)]
*  that we were suffering across the country. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=590.14s)]
*  So and our concerns about where the election was going, the whole mail-in ballot thing, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=592.78s)]
*  was being set for a compromise election cycle possibly. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=599.06s)]
*  And to our horror, that's what happened. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=604.78s)]
*  So FBI had fingerprints on this thing for many months prior to J-4, 5, and 6. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=607.66s)]
*  I want to go back to something you said in the first sentence, which is you have seen [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=619.5s)]
*  evidence and that spurred your questions to Chris Ray that there were FBI assets dressed [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=624.02s)]
*  as Trump supporters within the Capitol. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=630.22s)]
*  So that is proof of entrapment because of course the federal government could have prevented [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=633.02s)]
*  entry into the Capitol building, aren't that many doors. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=637.52s)]
*  You work there, you know. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=639.9399999999999s)]
*  But they allowed people in on purpose to entrap them. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=641.78s)]
*  That's what that proves, I think. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=644.54s)]
*  Does it not? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=645.86s)]
*  Well, it's certainly condemning. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=647.7s)]
*  It's another piece of the strategy that the government employed to sort of complete the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=650.0600000000001s)]
*  entrapment of Americans that they had infiltrated and then prodded and provoked online with [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=659.54s)]
*  those original seeds planted of actions like, you know, what type of gear to wear and just [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=671.5s)]
*  in language that incited behavior that could go the wrong way. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=680.3399999999999s)]
*  You know, pushing actions of legal and legitimate peaceful protest to an edge where those Americans [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=686.3s)]
*  would likely not have gone had they not been, you know, encouraged by the FBI plant amongst [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=696.5s)]
*  their number that they didn't know was there. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=707.74s)]
*  So by the time it was actually J6 and you had masses of Americans assembled outside [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=709.74s)]
*  the Capitol, like 99.9%, 100% peaceful, on the inside you had FBI assets dressed as Trump [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=718.34s)]
*  supporters that knew their way around the Capitol. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=734.1800000000001s)]
*  Before the doors even opened. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=737.62s)]
*  Before the doors opened. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=738.62s)]
*  I'll say, how are you going to get around the Capitol? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=739.62s)]
*  You've been there many times. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=741.34s)]
*  You need a guide to get from whatever door you go in. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=742.46s)]
*  It's elaborate. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=745.6600000000001s)]
*  It's a maze inside there. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=747.18s)]
*  So that's right. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=748.8199999999999s)]
*  So there's no way, Americans, most of which have never been to the Capitol, there's no [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=749.8199999999999s)]
*  way they can come in some random door that gets opened and then get their way directly [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=754.9799999999999s)]
*  to the to the statuary or the House chamber or the Senate chamber. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=759.9s)]
*  It's just not possible. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=765.02s)]
*  So the FBI assets that were dressed as Trump supporters that were inside the Capitol were [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=766.8199999999999s)]
*  there, I believe, and evidence indicates that they were there to specifically wave in the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=775.18s)]
*  Trump supporters that had gathered outside the Capitol and the doors open and they were [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=782.1s)]
*  allowed in and on the inside were, oh, there's some more Trump supporters. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=787.22s)]
*  But really those were FBI assets, law enforcement assets that knew their way around the Capitol [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=793.26s)]
*  and they waved those guys in. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=799.5s)]
*  They said, come on, follow us. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=801.74s)]
*  And they're the ones that led them on the path directly. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=803.5s)]
*  How do you think a guy has never been to the Capitol, got to come into the Capitol all [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=807.3s)]
*  amped up on emotion and make his way straight to Nancy Pelosi's office? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=813.66s)]
*  Come on. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=820.06s)]
*  It's like I couldn't get there. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=821.06s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=822.42s)]
*  I've been there for seven years. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=823.42s)]
*  I could come in some random door at the Capitol and make my way to Nancy Pelosi. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=824.42s)]
*  Everything is unmarked. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=827.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, those leadership offices are unmarked. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  It's confusing to get around in the Capitol. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=831.8599999999999s)]
*  Every American that has been there knows this. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=835.02s)]
*  When you go on a tour, you bring your family to D.C., you go through the Capitol, you have [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=837.66s)]
*  to have a guide. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=842.5s)]
*  And on January 6th, the guides were FBI assets, law enforcement assets, and they were dressed [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=845.3399999999999s)]
*  as Trump supporters. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=852.4799999999999s)]
*  They were positioned inside the Capitol prior to the doors being open so that the Americans [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=853.9799999999999s)]
*  that had assembled outside the Capitol, once allowed in, could be brought directly to the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=859.8s)]
*  areas where the FBI and the DOJ and the deep state actors knew would be the most sort of [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=867.4799999999999s)]
*  criminal action of Americans being inside the Capitol protesting without permit and [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=881.12s)]
*  things. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=890.44s)]
*  They knew they were setting the stage for arrest and prosecution. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=891.44s)]
*  It's such a crime. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=896.68s)]
*  Who planned this, do you think? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=898.24s)]
*  I think factions planned this. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=901.44s)]
*  I wouldn't say who, because I don't think there was one person that planned this, but [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=904.32s)]
*  I believe the faction of establishment liberals within the FBI and the Democrat Party and [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=912.0400000000001s)]
*  intelligence services to another extent, use their massive powers of surveillance and investigative [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=926.08s)]
*  assets that they have across the country, confidential informants, registered informants, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  non-registered informants, voluntary informants. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=947.08s)]
*  It's a complex web of FBI assets across the country that can be activated. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=951.4s)]
*  So if you have authority at some of the highest levels in the FBI, it doesn't take much. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=961.12s)]
*  The faction within the FBI and within our intelligence services that would coordinate [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=969.8199999999999s)]
*  with the most extreme liberal factions within the Democrat Party that were desperate to [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=976.12s)]
*  keep Trump out of office and worked within the theater of operations, shall we say, that [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=985.32s)]
*  the COVID-19 alleged medical emergencies nationwide and millions and millions of mail-in ballots. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=999.48s)]
*  There's no daylight between the compromised election cycle of November 2020 and ultimately [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1008.64s)]
*  what happened on J6. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1018.9200000000001s)]
*  So you ask who planned this? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1021.2s)]
*  This would be the combination of several of the most extreme liberal anti-Trump, anti-America [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1025.64s)]
*  first factions that win positions of authority within our federal law enforcement organizations [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1034.0s)]
*  and the Democrat Party across the country. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1045.2s)]
*  When you say that there were FBI assets in the crowd in the building beforehand and certainly [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1052.28s)]
*  outside, what's the scale of this? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1057.68s)]
*  You're talking like 10, 20? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1060.0s)]
*  No. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1064.8799999999999s)]
*  Based upon some very conservative but hard investigative effort evaluation of the numbers [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1067.3999999999999s)]
*  from putting together eyewitnesses and videos and affidavit statement and whistleblower [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1080.2399999999998s)]
*  statements and court records that have been revealed through individual criminal cases [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1089.0s)]
*  where J6 defendants have been prosecuted and smart attorneys have forced admissions by [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1096.4799999999998s)]
*  the DOJ and the FBI, but those admissions have been sealed within the parameter of that [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1105.8799999999999s)]
*  criminal case by protective order by the judge so I can't share them, but I've seen them. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1113.6399999999999s)]
*  So real hard objective and conservative estimates would put the number of FBI assets in the [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1121.44s)]
*  crowd outside and working inside at well over 200. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1132.36s)]
*  200? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1139.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1140.6799999999998s)]
*  So you were in law enforcement before you came to Congress in the military as well. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1141.6799999999998s)]
*  That's an extraordinary number, is it? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1149.36s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1152.28s)]
*  When you think about the scope of the operation, if you were going to do this, you would need [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1153.6799999999998s)]
*  that number. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1157.28s)]
*  Relative to like when Minneapolis burned down or when St. John's, the Episcopal Church across [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1158.36s)]
*  from the White House in Lafayette Square was set ablaze and all the Secret Service agents [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1165.8s)]
*  were injured. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1169.6s)]
*  Were there 200 FBI assets in the crowd among Antifa then? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1170.6s)]
*  I don't know how many undercover agents FBI would have in a situation like that, but J6 [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1176.8s)]
*  was the final act prior to arrest and prosecution of Americans that were identified as Trump [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1187.0s)]
*  supporters. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1203.24s)]
*  I mean the objective was to destroy the entire mega movement, to forever stain the patriotic [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1204.24s)]
*  fervor that was associated with the America First mega movement that had won in 2016 and [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1213.8s)]
*  we believe won again in 2020. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1223.6399999999999s)]
*  And the establishment on both sides, both major parties, were determined to smash that [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1226.28s)]
*  out of existence, not just by defeating Trump, but by destroying the reputations of the movement [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1234.3s)]
*  itself by creating this narrative that was totally false, but was heavily pushed that [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1243.6s)]
*  mega Republicans, America First Republicans are somehow a danger to our republic and a [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1254.9199999999998s)]
*  domestic terror threat. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1261.9599999999998s)]
*  There's a whole other story about what the FBI has done to tag in Americans as suspected [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1263.48s)]
*  domestic terrorists and following us as we travel across the country. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1270.76s)]
*  But the bottom line is that 200, I believe is a conservative number. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1276.52s)]
*  First of all, I think there's many more, but a number that I'm comfortable going on record [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1284.4s)]
*  with is that we believe that there were easily 200 FBI undercover assets operating in the [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1291.32s)]
*  crowd outside the Capitol, embedded into groups that entered the Capitol or provoked entry [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1300.56s)]
*  of the Capitol and working with FBI assets that would have included Metro Police and [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1311.2s)]
*  Capitol Police that would dress as Trump supporters inside the Capitol because those were the [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1320.34s)]
*  guys that knew their way around the Capitol. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1326.12s)]
*  Given the scope of the operation and the number of doors where entry was allowed or even encouraged, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1329.44s)]
*  and the number of people that were actually outside the Capitol and it entered, we believe [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1338.24s)]
*  200 is a conservative number. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1348.76s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1351.08s)]
*  It's shocking what you're saying. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1352.08s)]
*  It confirms everyone's worst suspicions about this. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1355.2s)]
*  That's clearly true. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1358.1999999999998s)]
*  Did you come across any evidence that the DOD, the military, either Defense Intelligence [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1361.2199999999998s)]
*  Agency or National Guard or any part of the US military played any role in this at all? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1365.6999999999998s)]
*  I have not seen that. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1371.3s)]
*  I've heard the echoes of that suspicion and I have observed circumstantial evidence that [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1373.58s)]
*  has been presented to me that I have reviewed. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1383.86s)]
*  But to me, it does not rise to the level that I would call actionable from an investigative [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1389.2199999999998s)]
*  perspective. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1399.9399999999998s)]
*  So there was some suspicion, but in law enforcement, the thresholds you're looking across is reasonable [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1401.3s)]
*  suspicion that would prompt a criminal investigation. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1409.42s)]
*  And then the next threshold is probable cause, which you need for arrest. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1414.02s)]
*  And then of course, in our system, finally, the last threshold is conviction and guilt [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1418.42s)]
*  beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1425.8600000000001s)]
*  So I did review evidence, Tucker, regarding some suspicions of military involvement in [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1427.42s)]
*  some way. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1437.0s)]
*  And I have reviewed some of that evidence that I've been able to get my hands on. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1439.64s)]
*  And I do not think that the military was involved, not at the level, most certainly not at the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1447.44s)]
*  level of the FBI and over the course of all of 2020. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1454.84s)]
*  And then on J-4, 5, and 6, the FBI working in coordination with other law enforcement [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1463.16s)]
*  assets that they roped into the operation from Metro PD from DC and the Capitol Police [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1471.0800000000002s)]
*  was sort of tricked into participating with what the FBI had been staging for 10 months. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1481.0s)]
*  If you take three steps back, this is not democracy. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1493.8799999999999s)]
*  So the federal agencies serve under the oversight of the elected president and then under the [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1497.96s)]
*  oversight of the elected Congress. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1503.84s)]
*  Their elected people get to make the decisions. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1505.36s)]
*  You have a Republican president, you now have a Republican Congress, and neither one can [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1507.1399999999999s)]
*  get a straight answer from the FBI. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1512.1s)]
*  No one has any control of the FBI. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1513.8799999999999s)]
*  You're describing a government within a government. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1515.18s)]
*  Well, in America, a question becomes reasonable men would ask when we face a crisis like this, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1519.26s)]
*  who investigates the investigator? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1534.8600000000001s)]
*  And the answer in America is Congress. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1538.3400000000001s)]
*  So we have the responsibility to investigate through the appropriate committees, which [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1543.02s)]
*  we're certainly doing that now that we have Republican majority in control of the committees. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1548.1799999999998s)]
*  But we don't have the power to arrest. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1554.86s)]
*  We can give criminal referrals based upon our investigative efforts, but we have to [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1559.06s)]
*  have a DOJ that's receptive to the criminal referrals. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1565.1599999999999s)]
*  So we've hit quite a brick wall, have we not? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1570.42s)]
*  Constitutionally, we have the responsibility to investigate objectively. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1574.6s)]
*  And anyone that knows me knows that's exactly what I'm pursuing. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1581.04s)]
*  I do not have, I'm not trying to create a crime to fit a narrative to blame on the FBI. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1586.76s)]
*  I'm following the evidence. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1593.56s)]
*  And to my horror, it implicates our FBI at the highest level and a conspiracy within [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1595.68s)]
*  our government at the highest level to create the, to set the stage for a compromised election [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1604.68s)]
*  cycle in 2020. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1615.3999999999999s)]
*  And then the actions that took place on J-4, 5, and 6. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1617.52s)]
*  And then the criminal investigation, arrest, and prosecution of Americans that they were [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1625.6799999999998s)]
*  able to entrap and document with the thousands of cameras that were operating that day and [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1633.76s)]
*  use that evidence that they knew they were setting up to investigate, arrest, and prosecute [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1642.08s)]
*  the Americans that they had entrapped. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1647.8600000000001s)]
*  So Congress can investigate these things, and we are, and we will reveal these horrific [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1650.3s)]
*  truths and we will have criminal referrals. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1658.04s)]
*  But until you have a president running the executive branch that will clean house at [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1661.58s)]
*  a DOJ and FBI at the highest levels and put American patriots in place that will be, that [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1671.42s)]
*  will act upon the criminal referrals that Congress provides, then none of those guys [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1677.6200000000001s)]
*  are going to get arrested because they're not going to arrest themselves and we don't [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1684.22s)]
*  have arrest authority. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1688.22s)]
*  I'm a little surprised and don't expect you to be critical of your colleagues in the Republican [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1689.6200000000001s)]
*  conference, but I mean, they do control the House. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1694.14s)]
*  Impeachment is a thing. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1697.14s)]
*  Chris Ray is still the FBI director. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1698.14s)]
*  I watched Republicans, some of whom I know, cheer the murder of Ashley Babbitt, who was [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1700.3999999999999s)]
*  an unarmed woman, less than 5'5", by Michael Byrd. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  They were on Michael Byrd's side. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1708.4799999999998s)]
*  And I have to say, for a lot of Republican voters, and I count myself among them, very [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1710.74s)]
*  clarifying, if you're cheering Ashley Babbitt's murder, shooting women now, that's okay because [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1714.9199999999998s)]
*  she likes Trump. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1719.6599999999999s)]
*  And their Republicans are like, yeah, I was happy. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1721.36s)]
*  Like, a lot of them thought that. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1723.76s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1725.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that was, and it made me sick. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1726.88s)]
*  Me too. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1731.04s)]
*  You know, there's a great responsibility when you wear a badge in America. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1732.04s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1738.68s)]
*  To be the designated servant of your community that has the authority to deny the freedom [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1740.1200000000001s)]
*  of a fellow American in the land of the free. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1755.56s)]
*  Like, that's a heavy responsibility. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1758.8s)]
*  So the escalation of force must be appropriate in order to affect a lawful arrest. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1761.72s)]
*  And a bad shoot is the worst thing that an officer can possibly be involved in in his [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1777.6399999999999s)]
*  career. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1787.12s)]
*  You know, it's the thing of nightmares for good police officers. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1788.12s)]
*  So to take what was, from a law enforcement perspective, was clearly a bad shoot because [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1794.44s)]
*  there's some basic rules you just cannot violate. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1800.24s)]
*  You have to attempt to effect an arrest before you can go to deadly force. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1803.32s)]
*  There was no attempt to arrest Ashley Batman. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1809.56s)]
*  There were officers on the other side of the window she was climbing through. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1813.08s)]
*  There were officers on the interior side of the window she was climbing through. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1819.8s)]
*  There was no indication that this had been going on for an hour. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1826.72s)]
*  And there was no reports on the radio anywhere else of gunfights. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1831.32s)]
*  So there was no reason at that point to expect that Ashley Babin or anybody else in the crowd [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1837.2s)]
*  was going to produce a firearm and start firing on police officers. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1844.52s)]
*  Why? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1847.84s)]
*  Because it had not happened. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1848.84s)]
*  So that's part of the totality of circumstance that a police officer is responsible for knowing. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1849.84s)]
*  We stay in constant communication with our radios. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1855.72s)]
*  We know what's going on. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1858.72s)]
*  That officer that pulled that trigger shot an American woman who was clearly in a physically [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1861.0s)]
*  compromised position climbing through the broken glass of a window. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1872.64s)]
*  It's not like she just stepped into the cage at MMA and she was ready to fight. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1879.56s)]
*  She climbed through a window, draped in a flag. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1886.4s)]
*  There's police officers on the other side of the window. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1889.84s)]
*  There's police officers on the interior side of the window. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1892.9199999999998s)]
*  So you have plenty enough officer presence if you want to arrest that woman and by all [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1897.24s)]
*  means pull her through the window, put flex cuffs on her and throw her in the corner. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1903.28s)]
*  We'll get to you later, ma'am. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1909.4399999999998s)]
*  We're kind of busy right now. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1911.12s)]
*  That's what you do. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1913.0s)]
*  You'd have grabbed that woman and pulled her through, flex cuffed her and threw her in [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1914.0s)]
*  the corner. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1918.1999999999998s)]
*  You handed her back to somebody that could pull her back from that front line right there. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1919.2s)]
*  So understand that they do very well. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1924.76s)]
*  Understand officers have to make split-second decisions, but you never make a decision to [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1928.76s)]
*  use lethal force unless it's absolutely called for and required. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1935.32s)]
*  If you're losing a fight, attempting to effect an arrest, then yeah, if the officer's life [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1942.8s)]
*  is in danger, it is all by himself, but there's never should be a circumstance where you just [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1951.44s)]
*  pull the trigger and a woman climbing through a window is clearly unarmed. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1956.84s)]
*  There's no evidence of gunplay from the crowd that she's coming from. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1960.84s)]
*  You've got officers on both sides of where she is. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1964.84s)]
*  You've got to arrest her, then by all means arrest her. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1968.72s)]
*  Put flex cuffs on her and move on so she can handle the next person trying to come [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1972.14s)]
*  through the window, but she don't shoot her. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1979.46s)]
*  So that was a bad shoot, and yet it was cheered. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1982.26s)]
*  Why do you think that was? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1987.66s)]
*  And there's this insanity that has taken hold in the minds and hearts of many otherwise [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1990.42s)]
*  reasonable American citizens where they hate Trump so much. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=1999.42s)]
*  They're so deeply embedded and they've sold their souls to the establishment that when [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2004.8600000000001s)]
*  we had an America First president and he'd stopped the military-industrial conflict, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2012.1000000000001s)]
*  forward momentum, and he began restoring power to individual members of Congress and restoring [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2020.7s)]
*  individual rights and freedoms and sovereignty of the state, and he took away the actions [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2029.06s)]
*  of the cartels and brought this real common sense approach to the executive branch and [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2034.46s)]
*  was leading our country in that beautiful direction. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2043.66s)]
*  This was interfering with the business model of the establishment. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2047.7s)]
*  So many career politicians on both sides of the aisle, and I don't like those guys. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2052.82s)]
*  I'm not one of them. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2061.3s)]
*  I serve my country in Congress, but I don't consider myself a politician by any means. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2065.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm a servant to we the people. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2071.42s)]
*  Some of these guys, they pop out of the womb to be politicians. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2074.1800000000003s)]
*  They're groomed their whole life to be a career politician. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2079.1800000000003s)]
*  And those are the ones that had this instinctive cheer for something really bad happening to [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2085.0600000000004s)]
*  a Trump supporter. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2092.3s)]
*  Their true color showed in that moment and it was an ugly color. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2095.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we shouldn't be shooting women, number one. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2099.82s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2103.82s)]
*  So where does this go from here? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2105.1400000000003s)]
*  You have this corpus of information that sounds like it's definitive. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2106.94s)]
*  When does the public see the detail and what's the process after that? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2111.26s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2115.54s)]
*  So evidence from criminal investigations by nature is rather secretive, but there is a [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2116.82s)]
*  tremendous compilation of data that I think should be made completely available to the [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2127.78s)]
*  public, and that's the digital files from J-4, 5 and 6. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2133.82s)]
*  This is where Speaker Mike Johnson can be a champion that will be remembered throughout [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2139.6600000000003s)]
*  history as the Speaker of the House that fully released unredacted digital files from J-4, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2147.98s)]
*  5 and 6 completely to the American people. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2159.5800000000004s)]
*  Within that data is full truth and the American people is the only staff large enough to frame [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2163.7400000000002s)]
*  by frame go through 80,000 hours of digital evidence. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2178.6600000000003s)]
*  Nobody has a staff big enough to do that, but we can crowd source it to the American [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2184.26s)]
*  people. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2188.98s)]
*  So you ask when will this evidence be released? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2190.46s)]
*  I've been encouraging Speaker Johnson as I did Speaker McCarthy to, by God, man, release [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2194.38s)]
*  this data to the American people. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2204.06s)]
*  Why won't they? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2206.14s)]
*  I believe Speaker Johnson will, but Mike is quite a skilled constitutionalist attorney [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2208.78s)]
*  himself, and he's a very measured, patient, faithful man. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2217.58s)]
*  So I extend trust to Speaker Johnson when he says that it's his intention to fully release [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2224.46s)]
*  called the J-6 tapes, but really it's digital evidence. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2235.02s)]
*  It's more than just video evidence. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2238.62s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2242.54s)]
*  Radio transcripts, the whole thing. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2244.62s)]
*  I believe Speaker Johnson knows that this is a significant duty that he must perform [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2248.22s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2264.14s)]
*  It's a moment in history where I believe our Lord and Savior has placed him in that position [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2265.98s)]
*  of service to the country, and he has a responsibility to fully release that data. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2273.58s)]
*  And then the American people will see for themselves what some of us have already learned [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2280.22s)]
*  to our horror to be true. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2286.86s)]
*  Congressman Higgins, thank you very much. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2290.86s)]
*  Free speech is bigger than any one person or any one organization. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2296.78s)]
*  Societies are defined by what they will not permit. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2300.3s)]
*  What we're watching is the total inversion of virtue. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KvneeoDB28&t=2302.54s)]
