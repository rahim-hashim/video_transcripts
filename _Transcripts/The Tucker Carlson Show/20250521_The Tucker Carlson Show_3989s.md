# Harmeet Dhillon’s War on the Discrimination Against White Christians and DOJ Corruption
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4)
*  I think it's part of the promise of this administration under President Trump to reform the government [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=0.0s)]
*  in the way that the people voted for. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=6.48s)]
*  I did my week of training after getting confirmed by the Senate. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=8.0s)]
*  I was like, okay, guys, it's time to get to business. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=11.68s)]
*  I want everyone to be very clear what the agenda is here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=13.48s)]
*  This catalyzed hundreds of lawyers to quit. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=16.0s)]
*  They had crying sessions in the DOJ. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=18.84s)]
*  They cried? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=21.52s)]
*  Brandon Johnson, mayor of Chicago, tell us how he appeared on your radar. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=23.16s)]
*  He said the quiet part out loud, which is, I hire mainly black people for the positions [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=27.72s)]
*  of authority. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=33.4s)]
*  That's the environment that produced Brandon Johnson, where you could just like openly [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  be racist. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=37.64s)]
*  You know, I don't like Jews. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=38.64s)]
*  I don't like whites. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=39.64s)]
*  I don't like blacks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=40.64s)]
*  Who talks like that? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=41.64s)]
*  $200 million in some cases is what it costs a city or a county to comply with a decade-long [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=42.64s)]
*  consent decree. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=48.04s)]
*  So in the end, the lawyers get rich and more people get shot to death. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=49.04s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=53.2s)]
*  Wow, it's just so evil. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=54.2s)]
*  It makes you think like, maybe we just burn the system down and start again. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=55.72s)]
*  Thank you, Harmeet. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=80.48s)]

*  Thank you, too. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=105.8s)]
*  Thank you, too. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=106.8s)]
*  Thank you, too. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=107.8s)]
*  Thank you, too. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=108.8s)]
*  Thank you, too. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=109.8s)]
*  Thank you, too. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=110.8s)]
*  Thank you, too. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=111.8s)]
*  I think we're all going to be focused on a particular agenda there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=112.8s)]
*  So, when I showed up or when the president was elected, I should say, there were over [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=115.8s)]
*  400 attorneys in the Civil Rights Division and about 200 staff, so a total of about 600 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=120.8s)]
*  people. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=126.8s)]
*  And, you know, Christian Clark, my predecessor, anti-police, you know, open racist, you know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=127.8s)]
*  her term for not being candid with the Senate during her confirmation hearings on some issues. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=138.8s)]
*  And so she had a particular agenda. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=145.28s)]
*  She got in there and she pursued that agenda aggressively. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=146.96s)]
*  And she had all the staff to do it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  Now under the first Trump administration, my predecessor in that job pretty much left [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  it untouched. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=158.4s)]
*  You know, he told me, kind of like there were career people there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=159.4s)]
*  If you wanted to get something done, they went to the U.S. attorney's offices. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=162.84s)]
*  Well, you know, I came in with a different perspective. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=166.68s)]
*  I think it's part of the promise of this administration under President Trump to fundamentally reform [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=168.84s)]
*  the government in the way that the people voted for. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=175.08s)]
*  And so that means in the Civil Rights Division, we should be standing up for the civil rights [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=177.8s)]
*  of all Americans, not just some Americans. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  We shouldn't be weaponizing the law in a particular way. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  We should apply those federal civil rights statutes that many of which were passed by [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=188.28s)]
*  and signed by Republican presidents and Republican administrations evenly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=192.52s)]
*  And the government shouldn't be putting its heavy thumb on the scale in most cases. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=197.88s)]
*  But in egregious instances, we should step forward and right these wrongs. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=202.44s)]
*  But what I found there was a number of lawyers, I mean, hundreds of lawyers who were actively [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=205.76s)]
*  in resistance mode. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, there were memos out there by former government lawyers telling current government [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=214.72s)]
*  lawyers in my department how to resist. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=218.96s)]
*  If you're given a direct order, ask for clarification, send 20 emails, question it, slow down your [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=221.24s)]
*  response time, say it can't be done. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, so I was actually looking out for that when I came. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=230.8s)]
*  And I did my week of training after getting confirmed by the Senate. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=233.68s)]
*  And then the next week, I was like, okay, guys, it's time to get to business. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=237.88s)]
*  I want everyone to be very clear what the agenda is here. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=240.88s)]
*  So there are 11 sections in civil rights. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  I drafted memos for each of those 11 sections for the lawyers and telling them these are [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=246.0s)]
*  the statutes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=250.76s)]
*  So for example, Americans with Disabilities Act, this is a statute that we enforce or [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=251.28s)]
*  Title 7, anti-discrimination or some of the other federal civil rights statutes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=255.72s)]
*  And then that's the baseline. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=261.0s)]
*  And then this is the president's agenda. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=263.84s)]
*  These are his executive orders that he's put out there about anti-discrimination, about [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=266.32s)]
*  anti-DEI, about enforcing our laws equally. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=273.84s)]
*  And that's the job. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=278.24s)]
*  You're going to apply these statutes within the framework of anti-discrimination, even [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=279.64s)]
*  handedly and without fear or favor. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=286.2s)]
*  And this catalyzed hundreds of lawyers to quit the Civil Rights Division. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=289.6s)]
*  So they quit because you informed them of the law. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=295.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  And the law and the priorities, their pet projects had changed. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=302.0s)]
*  They weren't going to be able to do those the way that they wanted. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=307.92s)]
*  And they thought that this part of the Department of Justice was just immune to democracy. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=310.32s)]
*  It has been. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=315.68s)]
*  Elections just had no bearing on this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=316.56s)]
*  It has been. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=318.56s)]
*  I mean, there were career lawyers there who were doing the same thing no matter who's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=319.44s)]
*  a president. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=324.72s)]
*  And so suddenly their little fiefdom that had remained untouched, like Shangri-La, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  was suddenly having to be responsive to elections. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=333.12s)]
*  So that's the definition of the deep state, what you just described. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=337.28s)]
*  It really is. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=340.32s)]
*  Elections have no effect. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=340.96s)]
*  It's like there's no way to control these people. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=341.84s)]
*  They act totally independently from the democratic system. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, that's the problem right there. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=348.32s)]
*  Well, that's what I found. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=350.08s)]
*  And so in response to my memos, of course, they began leaking to the press. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=351.2s)]
*  They began having unhappy hours, which they would invite supervisors, political supervisors, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  too, to make their point that they were unhappy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=364.64s)]
*  We got the point. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=366.8s)]
*  And they had crying sessions, struggle sessions, crying sessions in the DOJ. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  They cried? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=374.32s)]
*  Oh, there was open crying in the halls. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=375.2s)]
*  Crying? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  Crying. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=378.56s)]
*  Crying, yes. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=379.28s)]
*  And then one of my colleagues described to me, it was the last day a couple of weeks ago [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=381.12s)]
*  for some of them, they lined up in a phalanx and approached the elevator together. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=386.0s)]
*  And then they left the building together. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  And they were out to show their solidarity for one another as if they were persecuted. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=394.64s)]
*  How old are these? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  High school students or adults? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=398.8s)]
*  These are 30-, 40-, and 50-year-old career attorneys in the Department of Justice. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=406.08s)]
*  It's different. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=408.08s)]
*  I come from the private sector, as you know. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=410.08s)]
*  However, 30 years in the private sector, 18 years successfully running my own law firm. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  And you get to work. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=417.44s)]
*  And you put things together. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  And if it's not working out, you change tax and you try something else. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=422.56s)]
*  But there's no accountability. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=425.92s)]
*  And so that really has been kind of an eye-opener of dealing with that culture. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  But we're trying to change it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  There are people left behind. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  And I actually don't care what their politics are. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  They can have their views, I believe, in the First Amendment. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=437.44s)]
*  The question is, are you willing to do the job under the job description as set out by [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=440.16s)]
*  this administration? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=444.56s)]
*  After all, the DOJ is part of the executive branch. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=445.76s)]
*  The president gets to pick the top people running it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=447.76s)]
*  And he kind of gets to set the agenda. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=450.96s)]
*  So half your lawyers quit? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=455.44s)]
*  Who did you replace them with? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  So we are in a DOJ period here in the government. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=458.32s)]
*  And so I haven't replaced the people who've quit as yet. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=461.84s)]
*  So we're making do with who's left behind, some of whom share the views of the ones who left, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=464.88s)]
*  but perhaps weren't as able to get jobs outside. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=470.96s)]
*  And some who I think are willing to work with us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=474.0s)]
*  So my understanding was DOJ was going to be applied to the FAT in government. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=476.56s)]
*  But like DOJ is kind of central, central institution in the country. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  And having lawyers who can equally apply the law and sort of end lawfare, be honest and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  principled. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=494.64s)]
*  That's important. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=495.76s)]
*  Oh, I think it's very important. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=496.88s)]
*  And, you know, I've spoken to the attorney general about it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=498.08s)]
*  And I'm confident that soon we'll be able to hire some lawyers who are down with the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=500.08s)]
*  program of getting the job done for the American people. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=506.24s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to that troupe coming in. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=509.12s)]
*  But for now, I have some political appointees who are extremely dedicated and passionate. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=511.92s)]
*  I brought in lawyers of my vintage, quite a few experienced trial lawyers, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=517.76s)]
*  and a few younger ones as well. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=522.64s)]
*  But they're all dedicated to the cause. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=524.0s)]
*  And so together, just in a few weeks, we have already made a lot of news nationally, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=525.6s)]
*  going after the mayor of Chicago, for example. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=530.08s)]
*  First of all, thank you for that. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=534.96s)]
*  I was just thinking of you, I should say my former attorney and a great attorney, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=536.48s)]
*  going in to run the Civil Rights Division. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=542.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, they must have just died when you showed up. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=544.24s)]
*  Well, I didn't witness any of that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=548.72s)]
*  But the crying, the unhappy hours, the mass resignations, the leaking, there's a support [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=550.24s)]
*  group for former civil rights attorneys. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=557.6s)]
*  These are all indications. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, these are all leading indicators of the stages of grief. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=560.88s)]
*  One of the former attorneys goes on MSNBC regularly and kind of vents about the storied [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=565.5999999999999s)]
*  Civil Rights Division of the DOJs being destroyed. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=572.24s)]
*  Someone heckled me at the DMV when I was waiting to get my driver's license. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=575.28s)]
*  So it is cutting to the core of the liberal ethos that we're actually trying to apply [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=578.88s)]
*  these civil rights laws, which I believe in, in an even-handed way. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=584.4s)]
*  Equally. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=589.28s)]
*  Equally. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=590.0799999999999s)]
*  We're all American citizens. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=590.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  Equal protection. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  It means equal for all. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you would think. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=595.5999999999999s)]
*  You would think. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  And actually, I'm laughing, but it's terrifying what's been happening there. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=598.0799999999999s)]
*  And I'm truly grateful that you're there. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=603.04s)]
*  So Brandon Johnson, Mayor of Chicago, tell us how he appeared on your radar and what [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=605.76s)]
*  the response is. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=611.76s)]
*  Well, so first of all, I'm thankful for Elon Musk purchasing Twitter, which I sued a few [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=612.56s)]
*  times before he did that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  And now it's where I get a lot of my news. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=619.68s)]
*  Of course, you and everyone else. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=622.16s)]
*  And so I get criticized by the mainstream media, if you will, for being perpetually [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=623.76s)]
*  online, but that's actually where I see a lot of the civil rights violations in our [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=629.84s)]
*  country being exposed because people, elected officials in our country feel very comfortable [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=633.6s)]
*  acting with impunity and stating with impunity that they're going to discriminate. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=640.0s)]
*  And so he said the quiet part out loud, which is in Chicago, according to his words, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=643.2s)]
*  I hire mainly black people for the positions of authority. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  And then he listed out, he was at a church and he was- [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=654.8s)]
*  At a church, he said that? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=659.68s)]
*  At a church. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=660.72s)]
*  And I had a media reach out to me- [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=661.36s)]
*  You had to yank their tax exemption, those freaking churches. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=663.92s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=666.56s)]
*  I had a reporter reach out to me saying, how did this come to your attention? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=667.68s)]
*  I mean, as if it was some kind of secret. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=671.84s)]
*  He was like, I responded, well, the three angles of camera, I think, suggests that it [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=673.36s)]
*  wasn't meant to be confidential or anything, but it wasn't like some kind of a sting operation. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=678.48s)]
*  He publicly said, I find people of a certain description to be better, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=683.52s)]
*  and I want to help them build their businesses. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  And so I'm giving them government jobs. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  It's kind of counterintuitive. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=695.76s)]
*  And what that says and what I've been hearing since I came out and said, oh, really? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=697.84s)]
*  And then we opened up a federal civil rights investigation the following day [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=702.96s)]
*  into the hiring practices. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=707.2s)]
*  The following day? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  The following day, less than 24 hours after I saw that video, my team stepped up and we've [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=709.6800000000001s)]
*  opened a federal civil rights investigation into the apparent violations of federal employment law [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=716.4000000000001s)]
*  that are occasioned by preferring one race over the other in hiring. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=722.96s)]
*  His predecessor, Lori Lightfoot, said at a press conference, I'm not talking to white people. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=727.76s)]
*  I don't like them. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=731.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm not talking to them. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=732.48s)]
*  I'm not answering any questions from white reporters. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=733.2s)]
*  And no one did anything about it. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=735.76s)]
*  So that's the environment that produced Brandon Johnson, where you could just openly be racist. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=738.72s)]
*  I don't like Jews. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=744.08s)]
*  I don't like whites. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't like blacks. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=745.52s)]
*  Who talks like that? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=747.52s)]
*  Well, Tucker, every university administrator in the United States, even in the face of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=748.64s)]
*  the Students for Fair Admissions case at Harvard, so that's another project that we're [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=754.4000000000001s)]
*  dealing with at the Civil Rights Division, is the absolute extent of the impunity with [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=758.24s)]
*  which campus administrators are continuing to discriminate and openly defy Supreme Court [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=764.64s)]
*  precedent. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=770.08s)]
*  So we've opened up numerous investigations into that as well. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=770.56s)]
*  But it's a pervasive problem in our country that racism has become institutionalized to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  the point where people just feel comfortable saying, yeah, I'm sorry you're a white man. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=779.6s)]
*  Thanks for playing. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  And you don't get admission. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=785.12s)]
*  You don't get a job. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=787.76s)]
*  And you don't get to have equal opportunity. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=788.56s)]
*  Asians as well. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=791.52s)]
*  There's just blatant discrimination and racism in our country. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  And our job at the Civil Rights Division, for so long as I'm in charge of it, is to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=796.4s)]
*  eradicate that. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  Take it on, make examples, and put a stop to it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=802.4s)]
*  Everybody wants freedom, but what is freedom exactly? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=806.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, here's what we know. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=810.56s)]
*  You can't have freedom if you don't have privacy. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=811.92s)]
*  1984, you may recall, is a story about a total lack of privacy and a totally omnipresent [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=815.04s)]
*  government. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=824.16s)]
*  Totalitarianism begins with no privacy. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=824.8s)]
*  The problem is if you use the internet every day and everybody does, then you don't have [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  any privacy because it's all open. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=831.04s)]
*  Data brokers and big tech are recording and saving everything you do online and then [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=834.0s)]
*  selling it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=839.92s)]
*  Talk about invasive. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=840.9599999999999s)]
*  We've got two recommendations for how to restore privacy. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=842.7199999999999s)]
*  The first is trashing all your technology and going full Luddite. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=845.76s)]
*  That would definitely work. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=848.64s)]
*  Abandoning electricity. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=849.76s)]
*  Actually, I like that option. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=851.04s)]
*  Probably pretty hard for most people to do that, including me. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=852.88s)]
*  The second is to use a VPN. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=855.28s)]
*  The one we use is called ExpressVPN. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=856.88s)]
*  ExpressVPN is a new feature called Identity Defender. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=859.28s)]
*  It's available to all American customers at no extra cost. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=862.8s)]
*  Identity Defender scours the files of data brokers, requests to have your information [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=865.8399999999999s)]
*  removed from their files, and sends you a notification if anyone uses your social security [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=869.68s)]
*  number, which is obviously the first step to identity theft. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=874.8s)]
*  You can get an extra four months for free when you use this show's link, scan the QR [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  code on the screen right now, or go to expressvpn.com. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=882.4799999999999s)]
*  Get four extra months free. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=886.4799999999999s)]
*  That's expressvpn.com. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=888.16s)]
*  Slash Tucker. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=890.6400000000001s)]
*  Every time I hear someone in the administration talk about this, they frame it around Israel, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=891.84s)]
*  which I find infuriating. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=897.2800000000001s)]
*  Not because I'm against Israel, but like what does Israel have to do with it? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=899.7600000000001s)]
*  They're discriminating against American citizens. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  Why from a public relations perspective, would it just be better to stick to the principle [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=904.24s)]
*  that in the United States, you can't use government money to discriminate against [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=910.24s)]
*  American citizens on the basis of race? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  Like, why not just say that? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=915.5200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think that there is a certain strain of antisemitism that's unique that we are [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=917.44s)]
*  confronting, but it's American citizens who are the victims of it. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  And so religious discrimination is also illegal in our federal civil rights laws. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=926.08s)]
*  And so where you have students who are wearing yarmulkes, and they're being blocked by their [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=931.12s)]
*  professors and their classmates from entering their classes, that's illegal. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=936.5600000000001s)]
*  And we're just calling it that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=941.6s)]
*  I know, but let's be real. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=942.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's just silly. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=945.0400000000001s)]
*  Look at the numbers. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=947.04s)]
*  Are Jewish students, you know, what, 2% of the population? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=948.16s)]
*  Are there more than 2% at Ivy League schools? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=952.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=955.76s)]
*  White Christian students, you know, what percentage of the population are they? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=956.88s)]
*  30 something? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=960.48s)]
*  Are they 30%? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=961.36s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=962.24s)]
*  So, like, we could just reduce it. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=963.5999999999999s)]
*  But it's like you can't even say that for some reason. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=966.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, the discrimination has been going on for 60 years against white Christians, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=969.76s)]
*  and the numbers show it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=975.92s)]
*  So, like, do you know what I mean? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=977.28s)]
*  But I'm saying that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=979.8399999999999s)]
*  We are saying that under my leadership and the people who I work with, they are taking [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=980.88s)]
*  it on frontally. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=987.92s)]
*  It's racism. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=988.7199999999999s)]
*  It is racist. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=990.56s)]
*  It is illegal now under the Supreme Court's clear direction. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=992.0s)]
*  And Harvard is doing it and Princeton is doing it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=996.64s)]
*  And all of these schools are doing it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=999.92s)]
*  I mean, so there's many different kinds of discrimination happening. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1001.8399999999999s)]
*  There's foreign money coming into our campuses. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1004.72s)]
*  And there was a report recently that Stanford is basically under control of the Chinese [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1008.88s)]
*  Communist Party. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1014.48s)]
*  And so all of these problems are happening at the same time. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1016.24s)]
*  And, you know, they've been allowed to drift. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1019.0400000000001s)]
*  And people have been bullied. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  And people are... [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1024.56s)]
*  I was explaining to someone the other day that to do this job correctly, you have to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1026.32s)]
*  not care what people think about you at cocktail parties. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1030.96s)]
*  Well, clearly. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1033.1200000000001s)]
*  But you're way past that. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  But can I just ask, like, I guess what I worry about, just to put a finer point on what I [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1036.3999999999999s)]
*  was attempting to express, like, identity politics is just bad kind of no matter who's [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1040.48s)]
*  getting hurt and no matter who's benefiting. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1046.48s)]
*  It's just bad. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1048.08s)]
*  It divides the country. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1049.1999999999998s)]
*  Is there some way to just, like, deracialize the whole thing and just return to colorblind [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1050.9599999999998s)]
*  standards in admission, hiring, and contracting? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1056.9599999999998s)]
*  There is. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's what our laws demand. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1060.8799999999999s)]
*  And so that's what the Supreme Court ruled in that one case. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1062.64s)]
*  But, you know, to take on the mayor of Chicago, we didn't do that four years ago. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1066.16s)]
*  We didn't do that under the Bush administration. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1075.6000000000001s)]
*  We just sort of, you know, people in power just sort of sat there and took it as if there [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1078.24s)]
*  was some need to atone for prior sins by discriminating against American citizens today. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1085.68s)]
*  And, I mean, you know, Asians are discriminated against in hiring in Silicon Valley. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1091.6s)]
*  I've taken on many cases of that and in universities. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  What did these recent immigrants do to deserve discrimination other than being successful [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1100.7199999999998s)]
*  and then being punished for it? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1106.7199999999998s)]
*  And so you really can't right the wrongs of the past by being racist today. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1108.32s)]
*  I think we really have to have that level of moral clarity and just say that and operate [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1113.76s)]
*  that way. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1119.12s)]
*  Well, it's collective punishment is what it really is. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1119.52s)]
*  You're saying someone who looked like you did something bad, therefore I'm punishing [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1122.16s)]
*  you, or someone who looked like you was hurt, therefore you get the benefit now. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1125.84s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is just like it eliminates the idea of the individual, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1131.68s)]
*  of the individual, the unique human soul. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1136.24s)]
*  Right, which is counter to the very principles on which our country was founded. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1138.48s)]
*  The entire Enlightenment was all about individual rights and responsibility. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1145.6s)]
*  And we're engaging in Chinese communist level collective guilt and collective punishment. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1153.12s)]
*  It does feel that way. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1162.32s)]
*  It does feel that way. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1163.28s)]
*  And it feels that way on campuses. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1164.08s)]
*  It was, and I think back, I thought it was bad at Dartmouth when I was at Dartmouth more [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1165.76s)]
*  than 35 years ago, almost 40 years ago now when I went to Dartmouth. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1169.84s)]
*  And it's so much worse today in most of these campuses. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1174.0s)]
*  But like calling it what it is, naming it as racism and discrimination is a start. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1178.96s)]
*  Now, we will follow through and we will bring cases. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1185.92s)]
*  Proud of our president for spearheading, yanking money, our federal tax dollars, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1190.72s)]
*  away from the institutions that are the worst offenders. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1196.88s)]
*  And I think you're going to see much more of that happening soon. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1199.44s)]
*  I completely agree. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1201.36s)]
*  So back to the mayor of Chicago. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1202.32s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1204.24s)]
*  We've opened up an investigation. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1205.84s)]
*  We've demanded some data from him. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1207.2s)]
*  We will be in touch with some very specific data. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1208.96s)]
*  And we'll be going back years to understand. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1212.24s)]
*  And what I'm hearing from members of the public already is, well, I applied for this job. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1214.72s)]
*  I applied for that job. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1218.0s)]
*  I didn't get it. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1218.96s)]
*  I'm not the right race. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1219.76s)]
*  I'm not the right gender according to his descriptions. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1220.8799999999999s)]
*  And so what the federal government has been doing over the years to ordinary companies [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1223.84s)]
*  is demand this data and then force them to hire according to a particular pattern. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1230.96s)]
*  We're going to do the same thing. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1236.16s)]
*  We're going to demand the data. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1237.1200000000001s)]
*  And then if there's a pattern of discrimination, which I think there is based on what he said, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1238.64s)]
*  he's told us, we will leave him at his words, they'll have to take action to correct that. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1244.0s)]
*  They may have multiple. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1249.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm guessing that plaintiffs lawyers all over the United States are contacting plaintiffs [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1251.6000000000001s)]
*  right now in Chicago and preparing cases against the city. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1256.24s)]
*  So the taxpayers are going to pay for this pattern and practice of discrimination that [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1260.4s)]
*  has been described by the mayor. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1266.16s)]
*  But it's a long standing pattern. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1268.08s)]
*  He's just the one who said it out loud. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1269.44s)]
*  It's been happening for decades in that city. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1270.8s)]
*  At the same time, there's talk about reparations and multiple cities in the United States. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1274.72s)]
*  I mean, again, that's just a wealth transfer from people who didn't do anything wrong to [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1279.76s)]
*  people who didn't have anything wrong done to them really. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1285.52s)]
*  And it's counterintuitive to what we believe in our country. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1288.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1291.68s)]
*  Do you think that could happen? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1293.36s)]
*  No, but the talk of it is manna for certain people. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1295.76s)]
*  I think it is it is bait for Democrat elections and it's popular in certain communities. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1300.8s)]
*  And so it's crazy to see that. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1308.24s)]
*  But I do think the pendulum is swinging back in some places because these policies, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1312.24s)]
*  these wealth transfers, if you will, the episodic rioting that you see in our cities, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1317.6799999999998s)]
*  it is not conducive to a peaceful lifestyle or productive society. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1322.7199999999998s)]
*  And so I think you actually are seeing even in deep blue California, my home state, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1328.9599999999998s)]
*  my former home state, you're seeing the pendulum swing back in ways. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1334.48s)]
*  San Francisco seems to be slowly pulling back from the brink of extremism. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1340.24s)]
*  It does. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1344.24s)]
*  San Jose has a mayor who's talking some sense. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1344.8s)]
*  So I'm hopeful, but we can't be passive about it. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1353.04s)]
*  First, you have to be willing to call it out and stand up and say, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1356.4799999999998s)]
*  no, it is wrong to hire on the basis of race in America. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1360.08s)]
*  It is wrong to discriminate against people based on what their theoretical ancestors [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1364.24s)]
*  did 200 years ago. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1369.92s)]
*  This is wrong. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1371.0400000000002s)]
*  It's un-American. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1371.68s)]
*  When you initiate an investigation into the mayor of Chicago, first of all, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1374.48s)]
*  thank you for doing that. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1378.4s)]
*  I think one of the benefits of what you're doing is just noting something [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1381.2s)]
*  that everyone else takes for granted. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1386.72s)]
*  As you said, people feel free to say this and you're just reminding everyone this is [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1388.0800000000002s)]
*  against federal law and it's immoral. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1391.6000000000001s)]
*  So I think it's huge. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1392.96s)]
*  But when you order as sister attorney general this investigation, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1394.32s)]
*  does the staff obey in your office? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1399.52s)]
*  First of all, I'm surrounded by a lot of dedicated public servants like me who are... [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1404.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1409.6000000000001s)]
*  You get to have a few political appointees in the front office is what we call it. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1412.88s)]
*  So they jumped on it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1417.1200000000001s)]
*  Before I even asked, someone was drafting a letter on Sunday afternoon to do this. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1418.96s)]
*  We also call the acting chairman of the EEOC, Andrea Lucas, who's been working hand in glove [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1423.68s)]
*  with us on other discrimination issues. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1430.64s)]
*  And she's opened up an investigation as well. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1432.96s)]
*  So the EEOC has subpoena power. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1435.6000000000001s)]
*  We've asked for documents. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1438.24s)]
*  The EEOC can actually subpoena them and do a commissioner's charge. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1439.2s)]
*  And so eventually at the end of their parallel investigation, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1442.8s)]
*  they'll have data that they can share with us as well. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1446.0s)]
*  So we're working together in the university setting, in this setting, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1448.16s)]
*  and in other settings with other branches of the executive. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1454.72s)]
*  So I mean, on any given day, I'm talking to the White House, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1457.76s)]
*  I'm talking to colleagues of the Department of Education, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1460.8000000000002s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1463.76s)]
*  I had a conversation yesterday and other conversations like that are happening. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1465.68s)]
*  So the team is very focused on our common goals. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1469.6000000000001s)]
*  I hate even to say this out loud, but one of the ways that someone like you roles [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1473.8400000000001s)]
*  in, you've got a public career, so everyone knows exactly where you stand. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1478.08s)]
*  You've been highly ferocious over the years. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1483.84s)]
*  And so there's no question what you're going to do when you get there. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1488.1599999999999s)]
*  You're a known quantity and you're a massive threat to the way things operate there. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1491.04s)]
*  You haven't worked in a federal agency before. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1495.52s)]
*  There are all kinds of weird customs and laws, especially on classification. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1498.0s)]
*  And so someone like you, they're like, ah, let's trap her in something. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1501.76s)]
*  Are you worried about that? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1507.04s)]
*  Well, among the... [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1508.4s)]
*  I mean, Mike Flynn is the most famous example of this, but like... [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1510.64s)]
*  It is. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1513.92s)]
*  We've learned some lessons and there are always new ways and there is a deep state. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1514.48s)]
*  And just yesterday, I had a conversation with one of my colleagues about the resistance that [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1518.56s)]
*  he was encountering. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1522.96s)]
*  And I had my feedback, but part of my background is as an employment lawyer. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1524.96s)]
*  And so we're not making some mistakes that some people who are simply defense lawyers [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1529.52s)]
*  might have made. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1536.16s)]
*  I have a plaintiff's lawyer mentality. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1536.64s)]
*  And so I think, what would I do if I were the other side? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1538.3200000000002s)]
*  And so I think about that. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1541.76s)]
*  So we're giving people clear direction and opportunities. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  And if they don't want to take those opportunities and they want to be in resistance mode, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1547.3600000000001s)]
*  this is not the place for them. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1550.48s)]
*  And so there are career paths elsewhere and many people have chosen to take that. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1551.76s)]
*  Some of them regretted it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1557.3600000000001s)]
*  Some of them tried to come back. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1558.48s)]
*  I think it is best that people who have passions to do something that's opposite of what the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1560.5600000000002s)]
*  president's current agenda is should do that elsewhere. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1564.4s)]
*  Not on the taxpayer dollar. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1569.52s)]
*  Just my personal perspective. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1572.4s)]
*  So you've uncovered a bunch of stuff already. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1574.0s)]
*  And one of the things that you uncovered, I think, is part of the answer to why our [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1578.16s)]
*  cities have become so dangerous. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1584.3200000000002s)]
*  And it has to do with consent decrees that have been forced on cities and police departments [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1586.5600000000002s)]
*  by the federal government. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1592.96s)]
*  Can you explain how that has worked? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1593.76s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1595.92s)]
*  So the consent decree trend kind of dates back to the Rodney King riots. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1596.72s)]
*  And there's terrible rioting in Los Angeles. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1603.6s)]
*  92-ish? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1608.08s)]
*  Yeah, about 33 years ago. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1609.28s)]
*  Yeah, I was in law school at the time. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1611.6s)]
*  And the police got blamed for, I think, some fairly rotten cultural trends in our society. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1613.84s)]
*  The police got blamed trying to control that riot. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1625.76s)]
*  I mean, you have people like Maxine Waters egging on the crowd and feeding the flames. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1629.6s)]
*  And somehow the police got left holding the bag. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1635.1999999999998s)]
*  And so what happened was the Department of Justice, of course California as well, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1637.36s)]
*  but the Department of Justice opened up investigations into police practices. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1641.92s)]
*  And so the trend has been the Department of Justice, particularly under Democrat administrations, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1646.48s)]
*  opens up what's called a pattern and practice investigation. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1654.3200000000002s)]
*  And they basically say that any time one cop does something wrong, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1658.4s)]
*  it must be because there is a systemic problem with the police department. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1663.76s)]
*  There's poor training. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1667.44s)]
*  There's ineffective policies. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1669.04s)]
*  There's ineffective resources. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1671.36s)]
*  Or there's racism. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1673.9199999999998s)]
*  There's always racism that's underlying most of these police consent decrees is racism. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1675.04s)]
*  And I'll talk about current examples as well. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1679.9199999999998s)]
*  So cities, by the way, I mean, you've all seen this in prosecutions. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1684.6399999999999s)]
*  When the federal government comes after you with its endless resources and its punitive [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1688.8799999999999s)]
*  scope of measures that it can apply, even America's biggest cities worth with tens of [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1695.76s)]
*  billions of dollars of budgets, they quake because it can become very expensive and it [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1702.24s)]
*  can become a politically charged football to continue to have these federal court hearings [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1708.56s)]
*  and judges and all of that. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1713.44s)]
*  So what typically happens is the DOJ says, hi, we are from the government. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1714.72s)]
*  We think that you're a racist and we'd like you to enter into a consent decree where you, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1718.56s)]
*  to the city is going to pay Bob over here who works at a big white shoe law firm, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1723.68s)]
*  several million dollars to monitor your compliance with this. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1731.2s)]
*  I mean, this is a binder. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1735.44s)]
*  Some of the consent decrees are longer than this. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1737.3600000000001s)]
*  Hundreds of pages long of minutely detailed orders of what they're supposed to do to improve their [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1739.44s)]
*  police practices. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1744.96s)]
*  Who comes up with those guidelines? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1747.8400000000001s)]
*  The lawyers in the civil rights divisions of the United States Department of Justice. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1749.68s)]
*  They have a lot of experience policing big cities. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1753.92s)]
*  They have no experience policing big cities. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1756.4s)]
*  Some of them have probably never met a cop in the wild. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1759.2s)]
*  These are lawyers from good schools and they're very idealistic. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1764.96s)]
*  By the way, most of them have never tried a case in their lives. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1770.48s)]
*  And of all the consent decrees, one of the striking things I learned this week is of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1774.3200000000002s)]
*  all the consent decrees that the United States Department of Justice has imposed, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1779.92s)]
*  and there are dozens and dozens of them over the years, maybe hundreds, but certainly in [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1784.0s)]
*  recent decades, dozens per year in some years. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1789.04s)]
*  And the Biden administration, they opened up a dozen investigations and those are some of [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1793.8400000000001s)]
*  the ones that I've been examining since I got into office. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1799.28s)]
*  They only took two of those cases to trial. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1802.16s)]
*  In hundreds of instances of investigations, they lost one and they lost the police part [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1805.12s)]
*  of the other one. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1812.8s)]
*  There was a housing aspect of the second one which they won. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1813.6799999999998s)]
*  And so in all the years that you've read about Los Angeles and Albuquerque and Seattle and [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1817.84s)]
*  Portland and all of these cities being under consent decrees, no federal judge ever looked [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1824.96s)]
*  at the evidence and found that the United States Department of Justice actually proved their case [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1831.44s)]
*  that there was systemic racism or systemic improper training. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1836.88s)]
*  It was lawyers like the ones I described earlier who don't have much trial experience [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1842.56s)]
*  looking at a dry paper record, and by the way, over the last several years, sitting in their [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1850.72s)]
*  living room doing it because they were working from home during COVID. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1854.72s)]
*  So in their home looking at paper and selectively cherry picking evidence from these records that [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1859.52s)]
*  they forced the cities to turn over, reaching conclusions. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1866.48s)]
*  Not reaching conclusions that a jury agreed with or that even a federal judge saw the evidence of, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1870.1599999999999s)]
*  but simply bullying American cities into compliance and then presenting a fait accompli to a judge. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1876.0s)]
*  And in some cases, most cases, the judges would say, okay, I agree. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1884.32s)]
*  And what's particularly shocking is in so many of the recent instances of police consent decrees [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1889.52s)]
*  in the United States, woke prosecutors in those cities and woke city councils and woke mayors [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1896.08s)]
*  went along with them. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1904.6399999999999s)]
*  They wanted them because they too don't like the police. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1905.52s)]
*  And so it has been a sort of perfect storm of the taxpayer having to pay for monitoring. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1909.36s)]
*  Some fat cat lawyer gets a big contract that goes on for many years and crime skyrockets in cities [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1919.2s)]
*  with consent decrees. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1926.48s)]
*  This is called the Ferguson effect after Ferguson, Missouri. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1927.36s)]
*  When a city's under a consent decree, cops have to suddenly fill out reams of paperwork every day. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1931.6s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1937.12s)]
*  They don't want to do that. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1937.4399999999998s)]
*  They didn't become cops to sit there and do paperwork. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1938.4799999999998s)]
*  So they quit, they retire, they move to cities where they do want policing to be done effectively. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1940.9599999999998s)]
*  Crime goes up because criminals now know that the policing is not being done. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1946.0s)]
*  And so for example, and I'm not just saying this from a biased perspective, Axios did a review [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1949.84s)]
*  of cities under consent decrees. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1956.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think one of the figures is crime went up by 61% in Los Angeles County as a result [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1957.76s)]
*  after consent decrees were imposed on the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1965.76s)]
*  And so cities are less safe. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1970.16s)]
*  I mean, ultimately, you know, the purpose of a system is its effect. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1972.16s)]
*  So you could say, well, people don't, no one wants crime. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1980.0s)]
*  But like over time, if the DOJ is causing more crime in America's cities, they want more crime. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1982.32s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1989.6s)]
*  Um, you can just take the words of my predecessor at her own face value, which is, you know, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1991.28s)]
*  defund the police. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1997.28s)]
*  And so defund the police has become the mantra of so-called law enforcement in the United States. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=1998.6399999999999s)]
*  You don't want to think something bad is going to happen, but you got to take precautions in [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2006.08s)]
*  case it does. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2009.6s)]
*  And that's why you insure your car and your phone and of course your house. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2010.1599999999999s)]
*  But what about your life? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2014.08s)]
*  What about your family's future? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2015.28s)]
*  Do you have life insurance? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2017.04s)]
*  You might not because it's expensive and it's hard to deal with. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2018.16s)]
*  It's hard to get. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2021.8400000000001s)]

*  It has made us pay for the cities to become less safe. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2094.0s)]
*  So that's particularly galling. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2097.12s)]
*  We have to pay some, you know, person eating at Morton's. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2098.88s)]

*  And every time you see there are bad cops. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2117.6s)]
*  I want to be clear. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2120.08s)]
*  There are cops who shoot people and the DOJ also prosecutes those to be clear. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2120.96s)]
*  Part of our job in the civil rights division is a criminal section that criminally prosecutes [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2125.92s)]
*  bad cops. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2132.16s)]
*  I support that. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2133.12s)]
*  I've signed off on several prosecutions so far since I've been there. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2134.16s)]
*  And there's trials going on right now. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2138.56s)]
*  Cops who shoot somebody in the back and, you know, they exhibit excessive force. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2140.72s)]
*  But we also have to all be punished collectively, you know, back to the point of collective [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2146.56s)]
*  punishment. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2150.64s)]
*  We all have to suffer because there's one bad cop or two bad cops. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2151.3599999999997s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2154.3199999999997s)]
*  Can you imagine how many bad cops there are going to be soon? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2154.96s)]
*  No normal person wants to be a cop. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2158.3199999999997s)]
*  It's too hard. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2160.3199999999997s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2161.44s)]
*  You get imprisoned in a lot. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2162.2400000000002s)]
*  Philadelphia, I was talking to a cop in Philadelphia last week. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2164.56s)]
*  I'm retiring. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2168.0s)]
*  Everyone's gone. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2168.7200000000003s)]
*  Like you do anything, you go right to jail as a cop. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2169.84s)]
*  If you enforce the law, you go to jail. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2173.28s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2175.04s)]
*  I'm one of the few lawyers who's headed the civil rights division who's actually sued [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2175.76s)]
*  the police. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2180.48s)]
*  And I did it from the opposite perspective of what is expected. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2181.04s)]
*  So in 2016, I was at a Trump rally and there was a riot in San Jose. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2185.12s)]
*  And it was an organized, well-funded riot. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2191.04s)]
*  I'm just a citizen going to support my candidate. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2194.0s)]
*  I did the Pledge of Allegiance. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2197.36s)]
*  I met the future president backstage. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2199.12s)]
*  And then all of us were subjected to mob violence. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2202.16s)]
*  And what called me was the police, 200 plus of them with riot gear, just stood there [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2204.96s)]
*  and watched. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2209.04s)]
*  And I went and during the course of my lawsuit, suing over the fact that American citizens [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2210.08s)]
*  were injured in a violent mob, I asked some of them, like, why was that? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2214.64s)]
*  You get to the bottom of that lawsuit and it turns out that because of consent decrees [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2221.2799999999997s)]
*  and best practices of policing that are coming down from Washington, D.C. in the DOJ, the [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2225.92s)]
*  police are taught to basically in a crowd control situation, stand there and watch and [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2232.24s)]
*  not do anything. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2237.92s)]
*  So it is insane. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2239.2799999999997s)]
*  I was truly shocked by that. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2242.64s)]
*  And so I have experience suing the police and trying to get them to improve their practices [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2244.08s)]
*  and be more aggressive on behalf of the taxpayers, which is the opposite of what they're usually [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2248.4s)]
*  asked to do in these cases. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2252.0s)]
*  And so, you know, so we we resolved that case with some agreements that they would do some [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2253.2000000000003s)]
*  training and be a little different than what they were. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2258.88s)]
*  But what we're seeing in the Biden DOJ, which again, I came in and I looked at the books [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2261.92s)]
*  here, is it's striking that first of all, they took the four years to immediately began [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2267.84s)]
*  changing course, opening investigations that the Trump DOJ had closed and shut down. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2274.56s)]
*  And then literally after the election, after the election where President Trump won in 2024, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2280.0s)]
*  they filed several cases and made public several findings of fact in over, you know, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2286.48s)]
*  over 10 cities in the United States. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2293.84s)]
*  They hastily ran to court in December in Louisville, Kentucky. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2295.44s)]
*  And in January, January 6 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to file new cases, you know, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2301.04s)]
*  clearly at the tail end, they lost the election. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2309.68s)]
*  They're not going to be able to carry this through, but they wanted to make public these [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2311.52s)]
*  consent decrees. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2314.7200000000003s)]
*  So they put in front of two federal judges in these two cases in Minneapolis and Louisville, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2315.36s)]
*  these factual findings. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2320.56s)]
*  Now, these factual findings are done by lawyers sitting in their living rooms on a dry paper [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2322.8s)]
*  record. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2327.6s)]
*  And the findings are, you know, we have reason to believe that these cities engaged in racist [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2328.64s)]
*  policing and also violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2337.2s)]
*  That's a common theme running through the dozen or so consent decrees that I've, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2341.36s)]
*  consent decrees and factual findings predating a consent degree that I've reviewed at DOJ. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2345.7599999999998s)]
*  So the idea is that if a drugged out or mentally ill person is the subject of a call [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2350.56s)]
*  to 911, somehow the police dispatcher is supposed to know, just based on a member [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2357.44s)]
*  of the public calling or somebody calling for help themselves, that they should have done, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2363.84s)]
*  what, I don't know, dispatched a social worker instead of a cop to the scene after someone [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2368.64s)]
*  dials 911. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2372.56s)]
*  Is being addicted to illegal narcotics a disability? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2372.88s)]
*  I mean, you might think so, or reading some of the factual findings. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2376.7200000000003s)]
*  Are you being serious? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2379.68s)]
*  I am serious, based on the factual findings I have seen from DOJ. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2380.4s)]
*  I thought it was a crime or a failing at very least. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2383.2000000000003s)]
*  Tucker, it's a mental health issue and it's a Americans with Disabilities Act. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2387.12s)]
*  Actually, so if I'm addicted to meth, I have special protection. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2389.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, apparently the police dispatcher is supposed to know by that 911 call that they [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2394.16s)]
*  shouldn't have sent a cop, they should have sent a social worker. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2399.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's an insane standard. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2402.16s)]
*  And the federal government is doing that? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2403.3599999999997s)]
*  The federal government, DOJ, has been reaching those factual findings and then asking federal [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2405.12s)]
*  judges to impose thick, decade-long, minutely detailed consent decrees out of which [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2411.12s)]
*  cities struggle to get out of. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2419.2s)]
*  The average consent decree, Tucker, when the United States Department of Justice [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2421.92s)]
*  bullies a city into agreeing to it is over a decade. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2426.48s)]
*  So the problem isn't solved quickly by all the taxpayer dollars, the monitor, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2429.7599999999998s)]
*  the police reform, the community policing councils and groups that are set up in these [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2433.92s)]
*  consent decrees. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2439.28s)]
*  The judge overseeing it, the problem that was identified isn't solved. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2440.2400000000002s)]
*  In fact, it turns out that when you fund investigations and you fund monitoring [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2444.4s)]
*  and a monitor decides when you're good enough and your performance has improved, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2450.0s)]
*  you get more monitoring, you get more years of that. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2455.44s)]
*  You get more fees paid to big law firms like Hogan-Lavelle's and some other big law firms [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2458.1600000000003s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2463.28s)]
*  And the citizens pay the bill. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2464.8s)]
*  So it's a tax on Americans who live in cities because one cop or maybe no cops in some cases [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2467.28s)]
*  did something wrong. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2475.92s)]
*  And so it's a totally broken system. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2477.1200000000003s)]
*  And when we came into office, it was a priority of this administration to review all pending [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2480.2400000000002s)]
*  consent decrees, all consent decrees that had yet to be entered by a judge, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2487.6000000000004s)]
*  all pre-consent decree factual findings found by the Department of Justice and announced [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2491.6000000000004s)]
*  publicly shaming these cities and look at the data and see are these really justified? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2496.08s)]
*  And our immediate conclusion, by the way, not just our conclusion, in the case of Minneapolis [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2502.0s)]
*  and Louisville, federal judges to which these were presented had some tough questions. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2506.64s)]
*  And in the case of Louisville, the judge asked the DOJ lawyers, these DOJ lawyers I've described [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2511.84s)]
*  from the Civil Rights Division to explain themselves. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2517.68s)]
*  How did you reach that conclusion? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2520.4s)]
*  What are the data supporting your conclusion? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2521.92s)]
*  How do you account for variables like what are the high crime areas? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2524.72s)]
*  I mean, are the high crime areas racially different than the population of the city? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2529.8399999999997s)]
*  These lawyers did not have answers. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2534.72s)]
*  It was embarrassing. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2536.48s)]
*  And so the judge refused to enter the consent decree in Louisville and sent the DOJ back [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2537.44s)]
*  and said, I need your answers. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2542.3199999999997s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2544.3199999999997s)]
*  This is days before the administration is about to turn over. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2544.64s)]
*  So we've asked for a couple of continuances. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2547.12s)]
*  So what are the criteria that government lawyers use to reach the conclusion that there's [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2550.24s)]
*  systemic racism that requires a dissent decree? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2557.04s)]
*  Like, I don't really understand. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2559.4399999999996s)]
*  It's one thing to say in an MSNBC segue, but there's systemic racism. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2564.24s)]
*  But if you're a Civil Rights Division attorney, you have to prove it, correct? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2567.8399999999997s)]
*  You should have to prove it. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2571.92s)]
*  But as I said, no jury has ever agreed with the DOJ. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2573.04s)]
*  Since racism is an attitude that can have manifestations, of course, but it's really [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2580.32s)]
*  like a mindset. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2586.64s)]
*  How do you prove that? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2588.32s)]
*  So we have, of course, being the government, we have statisticians on our staff at the [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2590.2400000000002s)]
*  Department of Justice. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2596.4s)]
*  I was surprised to show up. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2598.0s)]
*  I was thinking, oh my gosh, let me look at all these lawyers. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2598.96s)]
*  What are their trial experience? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2600.72s)]
*  Oh, there's a PhD in statistics here. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2601.68s)]
*  That's going to be really useful in court. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2604.8799999999997s)]
*  But they could be, by the way. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2609.12s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2610.56s)]
*  So properly deployed, they could be. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2611.52s)]
*  But if you never have to prove your case, you never have to use them. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2614.16s)]
*  You simply beat people over the head with a statistics book. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2617.4399999999996s)]
*  And so that's what's happened here. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2620.24s)]
*  So I'll give you an example. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2621.2799999999997s)]
*  Memphis, Tennessee is one of the cities that the outgoing Department of Justice issued [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2622.24s)]
*  some pretty lurid-looking factual findings in. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2627.2s)]
*  And so when you start reading it, you look at, hey, the findings are all that Memphis [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2630.3199999999997s)]
*  is racist and their arrest rates of African Americans are disproportionate. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2635.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2641.6s)]
*  Anyone who's been to Memphis, it's such a wonderful place. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2643.12s)]
*  I love Memphis. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2646.08s)]
*  But if you come away thinking the real problem in Memphis is racism, then you're a liar. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2646.9599999999996s)]
*  Well, so Memphis is majority black. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2653.7599999999998s)]
*  The police force is majority black. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2657.44s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2661.1200000000003s)]
*  The homeless population, which is the subject of this consent decree finding, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2662.0s)]
*  pre-consent decree finding, is majority black. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2665.84s)]
*  And so the idea that there's disproportionate arrests of people who are on the street [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2669.28s)]
*  and potentially committing crimes is racist, black cops, black population, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2675.2000000000003s)]
*  and black homeless population. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2680.8s)]
*  How do you reach that conclusion that racism... [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2683.2000000000003s)]
*  You have to reach that conclusion because you are biased yourself. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2686.24s)]
*  And the lens that you're looking through is a lens seeking racism. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2689.4399999999996s)]
*  And if that's what you're seeking, that's what you find in each of these cities. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2693.3599999999997s)]
*  And that is what they found in each of these cities that the DOJ examined. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2697.52s)]
*  It's like the ANC or something. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2701.6s)]
*  But in the end, Memphis also has not only the country's highest murder rate or one of them, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2703.3599999999997s)]
*  like the worst schools and contaminated water and [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2708.8799999999997s)]
*  crumbling housing stock and no businesses. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2713.36s)]
*  And there's so many problems. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2716.2400000000002s)]
*  And if you just think it's like white people are the problem, nothing ever gets fixed. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2717.92s)]
*  Well, that's the problem with these consent decrees. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2722.4s)]
*  And so we examine these. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2725.12s)]
*  And look, one of the things people need to understand as a lawyer, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2726.7200000000003s)]
*  when I go into federal court, my name as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2730.7200000000003s)]
*  is on all of these documents that we file in court. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2734.7200000000003s)]
*  Sometimes the Attorney General's name is on it as well. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2737.6s)]
*  But my name is on all of these documents where we charge somebody. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2739.68s)]
*  And I have to be able to say to the judge, look the judge in the eye and say, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2743.2s)]
*  I believe in these findings of my Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2748.08s)]
*  Judge, I stand behind them. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2753.2799999999997s)]
*  And I'm confident that what we're alleging in these papers is true. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2754.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, Tucker, I looked at these findings and I and the lawyers who report to me in the DOJ [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2758.24s)]
*  said we cannot stand behind these conclusions. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2764.8799999999997s)]
*  I can't stand in front of a judge with a straight face and say that [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2768.64s)]
*  Memphis's problems are racist cops. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2771.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, they're not racist. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2774.88s)]
*  They simply are dealing with a population that happens to have a particular racial makeup. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2776.56s)]
*  The conclusions are not correcting for that. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2781.36s)]
*  The conclusions are not correcting for what neighborhoods have crime. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2783.2799999999997s)]
*  There's cherry picking of statistics. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2787.2s)]
*  There's imposing Americans with Disabilities Act layers onto these consent decrees that [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2789.6s)]
*  don't exist in the law. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2795.68s)]
*  The Americans with Disabilities Act does not impose on police requirements of how they [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2796.8s)]
*  respond to 911 calls. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2803.76s)]
*  It just doesn't. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2805.2000000000003s)]
*  So wishing it were so does not make it so. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2806.88s)]
*  And so what's happening is these cities are having to agree to these things because they're [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2810.32s)]
*  afraid of the consequences or they have a woke city council that wants the hands of [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2816.8s)]
*  the police to be tied. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2820.8s)]
*  That's the most corrupt thing is the cities were basically begging for these consent decrees [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2821.6000000000004s)]
*  to be entered. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2826.16s)]
*  And in the case of Louisville, we're dismissing the Louisville. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2826.7999999999997s)]
*  That's so weird. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2830.8799999999997s)]
*  You're a city councilman in a city and you want the crime rate to go up? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2832.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2836.72s)]
*  I think it's the weirdest, most suicidal thing I've ever seen. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2837.6s)]
*  No one's talking about it until we started looking at these. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2841.2799999999997s)]
*  And so we're dismissing and withdrawing the Minneapolis and the Louisville consent decrees [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2844.3199999999997s)]
*  that were put in front of federal judges just a few months ago. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2849.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't have confidence in them. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2852.08s)]
*  We are telling judges that this is not something that the DOJ can stand behind. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2853.76s)]
*  Now in each of these cities, by the way, Louisville has already agreed to hire its own [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2860.2400000000002s)]
*  police monitor without the DOJ forcing them to do it. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2864.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's not my business. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2867.92s)]
*  I wouldn't necessarily think that the problem goes to that degree. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2869.36s)]
*  Someone's friend who's a lawyer is probably going to get paid out of that and good for them. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2875.28s)]
*  But in Minneapolis' case, Minneapolis has already entered into a state consent decree. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2880.16s)]
*  So why are they still going along with this federal one? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2888.24s)]
*  Well, they thought the federal one would be worse and more onerous. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2891.2s)]
*  And so Minneapolis has publicly stated that they're going to oppose [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2894.56s)]
*  the Department of Justice's attempts to dismiss the case against the city, believe that or not. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2898.72s)]
*  That is like the craziest thing I've ever heard. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2904.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, you would think as a city leader, your job is first to protect your [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2907.6s)]
*  city and then deal with your problems yourself, which they're already doing in Minneapolis. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2911.6800000000003s)]
*  They're begging to be punished by the feds for crimes that they probably didn't commit. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2914.96s)]
*  Not even crimes, just sort of reason to believe that the police practices are [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2921.04s)]
*  improper or inadequate. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2926.96s)]
*  But they want to be punished. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2928.2400000000002s)]
*  It spanked me harder, Daddy. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2929.36s)]
*  I want to put words into their mouths, but their actions are that they would oppose the DOJ, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2931.36s)]
*  letting them sort it out themselves. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2935.92s)]
*  I mean, it is what it is. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2938.0s)]
*  So not every city is like that and not every municipality is like that. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2940.88s)]
*  There are six other jurisdictions that the DOJ issued findings in that were withdrawing. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2944.32s)]
*  Hey, it's Tucker Carlson. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2949.84s)]
*  You may have noticed that the companies whose products you buy tend to kind of hate you. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2950.88s)]
*  They're controlled by massive multinational corporations and they have all kinds of weird [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2954.2400000000002s)]
*  agendas that you're supporting when you buy their products. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2959.44s)]
*  We didn't realize that nicotine pouches, which we've used for years, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2961.84s)]
*  were in this category. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2966.0s)]
*  We just want a nicotine pouch. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2966.8799999999997s)]
*  And then they lecture you and take the money you give them to support things that you hate. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2968.16s)]
*  So we decide we're going to make our own and we did. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2972.56s)]
*  And it is, we can say, not bragging here, just stating fact, the single best nicotine pouch [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2974.96s)]
*  in the world is called Alvin and it comes in all kinds of excellent flavors. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2980.64s)]
*  Wintergreen, tropical fruit, chilled mint, refreshing chill, sweet nectar, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2985.2s)]
*  and a bunch of others that we're rolling out. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2990.3199999999997s)]
*  By the way, there are 20 per tin, not 15 like some of our competitors will not be named. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2991.84s)]
*  And they're in three, six and nine milligrams. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=2997.44s)]
*  It is the single best nicotine pouch ever made. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3000.2400000000002s)]
*  You will not regret it. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3003.04s)]
*  Did you know that this was going on? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3006.1600000000003s)]
*  Look, I knew that consent decrees were an abusive process. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3008.56s)]
*  I did not realize the extent to which there was collusion in this process. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3011.84s)]
*  I mean, we have, we have perpetual monitors who have made decades of their lives getting paid. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3015.76s)]
*  There's one which a city that just closed up its consent decree, DOJ dismissed it after a decade. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3021.2000000000003s)]
*  A single man got paid a million dollars a year to monitor. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3027.6800000000003s)]
*  A year? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3031.92s)]
*  A year to monitor a city's compliance with a DOJ consent decree that went on and on and on. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3032.96s)]
*  And these consent decree monitors set compliance rates of 95% or 100%. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3040.8s)]
*  And it's like, it's like Zeno's paradox. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3046.56s)]
*  You never actually reach 100% because you never reach 94%. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3049.8399999999997s)]
*  You never reach 95%. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3053.7599999999998s)]
*  And the judge is a guy getting paid to determine the outcome. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3054.88s)]
*  And it is a broken system. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3058.88s)]
*  Some of these consent decree monitors have fake companies, shell companies that haven't been [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3063.12s)]
*  registered with any state. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3068.7999999999997s)]
*  Some of them have fake nonprofits that aren't really nonprofits. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3070.08s)]
*  They sell themselves and there's never any accountability. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3075.3599999999997s)]
*  And so at a minimum, what we're doing for all of these existing consent decrees as well is to [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3078.88s)]
*  look at these monitors. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3083.28s)]
*  Are they real? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3085.04s)]
*  What goals have they accomplished in a decade? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3086.0s)]
*  Are things better in that city? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3088.7200000000003s)]
*  Are the people safer? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3090.0s)]
*  What are we getting in exchange? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3092.08s)]
*  Some of these consent decrees, Tucker, cost cities over the course of this 10 years. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3093.6800000000003s)]
*  Just forget the monitor who's getting paid 10 million bucks on average. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3097.92s)]
*  $200 million in some cases is what it costs a city or a county to comply [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3102.56s)]
*  with a decade long consent decree because they have to do all these endless trainings [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3107.6s)]
*  and they have to fill out all these forms. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3111.7599999999998s)]
*  The Department of Justice in the last four years has spent 65,000 hours in the civil [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3114.0s)]
*  rights division, which only had about 60 lawyers. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3119.6s)]
*  So tens of thousands of hours monitoring these consent decrees. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3122.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it is a mind boggling volume of waste. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3129.2s)]
*  So in the end, the lawyers get rich and more people get shot to death. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3133.2s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3137.28s)]
*  That is the average outcome of a consent decree. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3138.2400000000002s)]
*  Wow, it's just so evil. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3142.72s)]
*  It makes you think like, maybe we just burn the system down and start again. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3144.32s)]
*  Well, what we're doing is one by one looking at every existing consent decree. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3148.72s)]
*  And I haven't gotten through all of them, but we got to the point where six weeks in, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3152.4s)]
*  I said, look, we have to put a stop to these. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3156.4s)]
*  I mean, some of these, so Phoenix, Arizona, we're dismissing the findings, we're withdrawing [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3158.3199999999997s)]
*  the findings in our pre-consent decree efforts there. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3163.9199999999996s)]
*  Mount Vernon, New York, a tiny police department with what I would say a couple of practices [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3167.8399999999997s)]
*  that I wouldn't necessarily agree are the best practices, but they've also agreed to [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3173.52s)]
*  stop doing them. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3177.68s)]
*  So why is the federal government getting involved and putting together thick reports? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3178.3999999999996s)]
*  Oklahoma City is another one. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3183.2799999999997s)]
*  Trenton, New Jersey is another one. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3185.84s)]
*  The Mississippi police department is another one. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3188.96s)]
*  The Mississippi, the state police is another one. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3193.52s)]
*  And then we have Memphis, which we already discussed. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3199.76s)]
*  And so in some cases, these cities didn't go along with them. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3202.2400000000002s)]
*  They fought the DOJ, so good for them having some integrity in their city government. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3205.92s)]
*  I've heard from members of Congress in some of these jurisdictions who said, this consent [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3211.36s)]
*  decree is simply, I mean, I'll give you the example of Phoenix. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3215.76s)]
*  So Phoenix seems to be an attempt by the Department of Justice to go after a sort of purple, reddish [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3218.96s)]
*  jurisdiction and hold them accountable for trying to impose quality of life standards. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3225.76s)]
*  So for example, Phoenix has been called to account in the DOJ report that we're withdrawing [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3231.1200000000003s)]
*  as part of my investigation for moving the homeless along. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3235.6800000000003s)]
*  And what law do they cite in this consent decree analysis? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3240.6400000000003s)]
*  They cite the Boise, Idaho case that people are familiar with where the court, the Ninth [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3245.04s)]
*  Circuit held that it was unconstitutional for Boise to try to move homeless people off the [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3251.7599999999998s)]
*  street unless you had a nice housing to put them in. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3258.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, the United States Supreme Court reversed that. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3262.0s)]
*  And so they reversed it in the Grants Pass case. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3265.52s)]
*  So we're even today in the DOJ's recent consent decree work simply ignoring binding Supreme [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3268.56s)]
*  Court precedent that says that what the police were doing in Phoenix is A-OK under the law [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3275.04s)]
*  and hoping to simply bully them into compliance. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3281.36s)]
*  So this is not what our federal government should be doing. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3284.24s)]
*  Because they want more people living on the sidewalk? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3285.44s)]
*  If you take three steps back, it's like so dark, so diseased. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3288.72s)]
*  You want more violent crime. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3293.7599999999998s)]
*  You want more drug abuse. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3295.68s)]
*  You want more people living on the street. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3297.04s)]
*  Why would you want any of that? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3298.56s)]
*  Why would any elected official of any party want that in the United States in 2025? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3299.92s)]
*  Well, I don't get it. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3306.4s)]
*  And so in these eight cases, we're getting rid of them and there will be more. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3307.44s)]
*  I'm confident. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3311.84s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3312.48s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know any of this. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3313.2s)]
*  But it's part of the explanation for why we have more of all of those things. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3315.2s)]
*  You look around, you're like, I don't recognize this. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3318.8s)]
*  Like, I grew up here. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3320.72s)]
*  We never had any of this. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3321.7599999999998s)]
*  Why do we have it now? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3323.52s)]
*  And part of the answer clearly is what you're describing, which is an attempt by [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3325.12s)]
*  elements of the Department of Justice to like create these outcomes. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3330.32s)]
*  Well, and on top of that, there's some corrupt rent seeking as well. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3334.32s)]
*  Let's just call it what it is. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3336.8s)]
*  Like I said, these white shoe lawyers, one was thrown out of a casino earlier this year. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3340.4s)]
*  A prominent lawyer at a major law firm was thrown out of a casino, is intoxicated. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3347.6s)]
*  When the police came, he said, I'm with the DOJ. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3354.32s)]
*  I'm the police monitor. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3359.04s)]
*  And so you can't touch me. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3361.28s)]
*  Other cities have reported to us, lawyers, my colleagues in the DOJ, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3363.84s)]
*  that if you dare complain about my bills, I'm going to keep you under a consent decree longer. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3368.4s)]
*  I mean, it's that level of shakedown. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3375.2000000000003s)]
*  My bills as in billing, as in payment to me? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3377.36s)]
*  My billing. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3380.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3381.84s)]
*  When the bills are questioned, the city gets punished harder. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3382.88s)]
*  So, you know, you would hope judges are looking at these things carefully. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3386.48s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3393.44s)]
*  Judges are busy and judges are not looking at them that carefully. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3394.56s)]
*  So just to be clear, you have half of your staff attorney positions unfilled [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3398.7999999999997s)]
*  because you don't have the budget to hire new lawyers, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3405.44s)]
*  ones who might actually want to follow the law. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3408.72s)]
*  But we somehow have the money, even post-doge, to pay monitors a million dollars a year [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3411.6s)]
*  to oversee arrangements that lead to more violent crime. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3418.56s)]
*  Well, the monitors are not being paid by the DOJ. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3421.28s)]
*  They're being paid by the cities. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3423.36s)]
*  So the cities that are under the lens of the DOJ are having these costs imposed on them. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3425.2s)]
*  And there's, like I said, no accountability. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3432.56s)]
*  They're annual conferences of the judges who impose the consent decrees, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3435.8399999999997s)]
*  of the monitors who enjoy the fees and don't solve the problem, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3440.16s)]
*  and the city officials who think it's all kind of a game. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3444.64s)]
*  Let's have community policing and let's have a bunch of random people [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3449.92s)]
*  who have no background in dealing with crime tell the police what to do. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3454.72s)]
*  There's annual junkets. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3459.52s)]
*  It's an industry. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3462.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a multi-billion dollar industry making America more unsafe for the most part. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3463.6s)]
*  Does anyone ever consider the fact that violent crime causes racism, actually? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3469.2799999999997s)]
*  That's just true. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3476.24s)]
*  When people are afraid, first of all, people are afraid they become much less reasonable. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3477.68s)]
*  I think everybody does. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3482.56s)]
*  It's just a good human response, right? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3483.52s)]
*  Well, people are afraid in America's cities. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3485.2799999999997s)]
*  And we have been made to believe that riots, like after the Minneapolis incident with George [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3487.84s)]
*  Floyd, like the regrettable incident where Breonna Taylor was shot. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3496.0s)]
*  By the way, my department is prosecuting the two cops who lied to get a no-knock warrant in that [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3501.52s)]
*  case. That is a serious offense and we're going to hold those individuals accountable, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3510.0s)]
*  which is different than holding the whole city of Louisville and all the taxpayers in that city [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3515.28s)]
*  accountable for mistakes that were allegedly made by two individuals. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3520.0s)]
*  What a concept, individual responsibility for individual mistakes. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3527.52s)]
*  We do that regularly. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3534.48s)]
*  In each of these jurisdictions, Tucker, where the DOJ has been examining these police departments, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3535.36s)]
*  there have been police misconduct cases and cops have been punished, either at the state level or [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3543.52s)]
*  at the federal level. That's appropriate. They're bad actors in every industry, in [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3547.68s)]
*  media and law and medicine. But asking cops as a matter of a multi-hundred page consent to [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3554.08s)]
*  create a sort of be doctors and predict Americans with Disabilities Act outcomes, adverse outcomes, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3561.52s)]
*  is just insane and it doesn't work. Let's face it, if these lawyers were any good at [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3570.8799999999997s)]
*  organic chemistry, they wouldn't be lawyers, right? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3579.2799999999997s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3582.08s)]
*  I mean, you know, so the government cannot be the be all and end all solution to all [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3582.56s)]
*  social ills and this is an example. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3590.3999999999996s)]
*  Is there anything you can do about the consent decrees already in place? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3593.6s)]
*  We are going to be, we are examining them and we're going to be bringing to the attention of [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3597.04s)]
*  judges inappropriate conduct by monitors. The one I just mentioned is one who is [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3601.7599999999998s)]
*  right to be mentioned to a judge as someone committing misconduct. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3607.36s)]
*  Monitors who claim to have nonprofits or corporations, but they don't. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3612.7999999999997s)]
*  We're going to be bringing those to the attention of a judge. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3617.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't understand. I mean, I thought the legal profession was self-policing through the bar. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3619.04s)]
*  I don't understand why nobody has ever disbarred except for like representing Donald Trump. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3625.2s)]
*  I don't understand that. Where is the bar, the state bars? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3629.52s)]
*  You raise a very good question and the question I've raised myself. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3634.64s)]
*  And so we have today in 2025, lawyers who have been, are under prosecution. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3638.16s)]
*  I mean, this is happening in Arizona, in Nevada, and other jurisdictions, California, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3645.8399999999997s)]
*  or a bar complaint for who they represented. You're absolutely right. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3651.68s)]
*  And what arguments they made even privately to their client and not even in front of a judge. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3655.52s)]
*  John Eastman is an example of that and so many others. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3661.2s)]
*  And yet you have corrupt monitors who are holding cities hostage effectively and all the taxpayers [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3664.32s)]
*  in those cities for their personal benefit. And then you have city councils who are elected [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3670.32s)]
*  to represent the people and instead they would like to see the cops handcuffed and see the streets [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3676.08s)]
*  burning in their cities. And this is a lack of accountability. It is a broken system. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3682.88s)]
*  And at least the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division is not going to be participating [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3687.52s)]
*  in making that broken system worse under President Trump's leadership and under [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3693.04s)]
*  our current attorney general. Amazing. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3697.6s)]
*  I know what a concept, right? Well, that's an amazing story. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3700.64s)]
*  I didn't even know that was happening, but it explains a lot. So basically you just got there [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3704.0s)]
*  to run this division. Six weeks ago. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3709.52s)]
*  It's incredible. So there's probably so many things that you're looking at [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3711.6s)]
*  that you want to examine that have been going on that most people, including me, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3718.16s)]
*  didn't know about. What are some of those things? Well, there are 11 sections in the Civil Rights [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3722.56s)]
*  Division and some of the things that we're going to be looking at in coming weeks and months include [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3727.36s)]
*  the rampant anti-Christian bias happening throughout the United States. And so [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3731.92s)]
*  there's anti-Christian bias happening within the government. There are chaplains in the military [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3736.64s)]
*  who are told to tone down their Christianity under the prior administration and that's insane. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3743.92s)]
*  And in America, we're founded on religious liberty and specifically in the Protestants who came here [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3750.08s)]
*  to be able to practice their faith freely. And so we're bringing back a focus on that. There's a [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3756.32s)]
*  called- Bless you. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3761.8399999999997s)]
*  Thank you. And it's important. And it's important for all people of faith in America. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3763.04s)]
*  I totally agree. To be able to worship. And so we're bringing a number of cases under what's [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3766.4s)]
*  called the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which is when jurisdictions are [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3771.68s)]
*  discriminating on the basis of zoning against houses of worship, be they Christian, Jewish, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3777.7599999999998s)]
*  Muslim or any faith. That's right. That's happening throughout the United States. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3784.56s)]
*  I don't like it when they hassle the Scientologists. I didn't like it when they [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3788.64s)]
*  hassled the Orthodox Jews in Borough Park during COVID. It's not about- I'm not Jewish or [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3791.68s)]
*  Scientologist, but I agree with you. People of faith have an interest in religious freedom, period. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3797.2s)]
*  And we have a federal law that gives them higher than First Amendment protection, that law that I [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3802.16s)]
*  mentioned. And so we're going after Forestburg, New York. We're going after other jurisdictions [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3806.7999999999997s)]
*  that are doing this. And so we are going after discrimination in employment. Like the Chicago [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3811.2799999999997s)]
*  cases, and people have been texting me all in the last 24 hours and 48 hours since we started this [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3818.0s)]
*  investigation, giving me other examples of other cities doing the exact same thing. So we have a [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3823.6s)]
*  lot of work cut out for us. The DOJ civil rights generally covers, not exclusively, but generally [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3829.2799999999997s)]
*  covers government discrimination. I mean, occasionally it will verge into private [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3835.3599999999997s)]
*  discrimination. Colorado is forcing a Christian camp to supposedly allow boys to be in the girls' [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3839.52s)]
*  changing rooms. That's a violation of the religious liberty of the kids and the families going to that [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3848.4s)]
*  Christian camp. We're going to be going after schools that try to take from parents their [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3854.48s)]
*  natural God-given and constitutional right to control their children's education, be it with [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3860.64s)]
*  sexualized curricula or transgenderism that's happening in our schools throughout the United [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3865.52s)]
*  States from the most unlikely places. And I kind of joke, I'll start the day at eight o'clock in the [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3871.44s)]
*  morning or earlier sometimes, and throughout the day one or the other one of my deputies jumps [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3879.2s)]
*  into my office and I'm like, oh, what fresh hell is this? The sheer volume of violations of our [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3883.36s)]
*  civil rights happening by the state and local petty bureaucrats and wrong-minded private people [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3888.32s)]
*  throughout the United States is overwhelming sometimes. So if I had 400 lawyers plus at my [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3897.6800000000003s)]

*  Dinner Party. And I wasn't invited. And that's okay because I'm too busy working and knitting [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3921.84s)]
*  in my spare time. So great. Harmeet Dhillon, the Assistant Attorney General of the United States. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3928.2400000000002s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3933.28s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3938.8s)]
*  that's what they do. But on another level, it's shocking. With everything that's going on in the [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3943.68s)]
*  world right now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3947.44s)]
*  one the cusp of fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3952.48s)]
*  rather than more. And that is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3957.7599999999998s)]
*  we could whine about it. That's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3964.3999999999996s)]
*  way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3968.08s)]
*  deceptive. The way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3972.96s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. That way, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3978.2400000000002s)]
*  you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFbAQKMZnb4&t=3983.2s)]
