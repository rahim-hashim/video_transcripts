**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE)
*  So he's Italian. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's Italian by way of Lebanese. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  It's like Sicilian. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5.54s)]
*  It's Arabs and Sicilian. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6.94s)]
*  Sicilian, yes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8.94s)]
*  But I'm neither. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=9.94s)]
*  My father's Filipino. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=10.94s)]
*  My mother's Irish. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=11.94s)]
*  He was adopted. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=12.94s)]
*  Oh, my dad was adopted too. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=13.94s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=14.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=15.94s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=16.94s)]
*  Okay, so here's my question. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=30.0s)]
*  You're a reporter. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=39.44s)]
*  You've been a reporter your entire life. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=41.04s)]
*  Your dad was a reporter, well-known reporter, so you grew up in journalism. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=42.4s)]
*  Journalism is now justly, I would say, the most hated profession. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=47.08s)]
*  The Sackler family is more popular than NBC News at this point. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=50.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=54.44s)]
*  Congress is more popular. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=55.44s)]
*  Congress is literally... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=56.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=57.44s)]
*  People are like, you know, maybe a child molester can be fixed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  We don't need to execute them, but NBC News, okay. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  So that's bewildering, I'm sure, for you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=65.72s)]
*  But for those of us who are having trouble remembering what the media landscape looked [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=67.44s)]
*  like in 1990 when you were finishing college, what were your assumptions about journalism? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=72.16s)]
*  What did you think you were getting into when you started? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=77.92s)]
*  So I grew up around my dad's work. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=81.28s)]
*  He was a TV reporter in kind of the heyday of local affiliate news, like As Portrayed [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=85.22s)]
*  and Anchorman, the bad facial hair, all that stuff. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=92.66s)]
*  So I used to hang around the newsroom all the time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=96.98s)]
*  And my father is sort of a reporter's reporter. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=99.02s)]
*  He's very gifted at striking up conversations with people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=102.14s)]
*  He's really good at that aspect of the job, which is, I would say, probably the most important [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=105.98s)]
*  thing, which is being able to talk to people and get everybody's perspective. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=111.34s)]
*  He would be able to go to any scene of fire or murder or whatever, instantaneously get [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=115.18s)]
*  people talking to him and trusting him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  Where does that skill come from? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  I think you just have to be born with it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=127.86000000000001s)]
*  He had a certain gregariousness that some people have. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=129.78s)]
*  He likes people? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=133.38s)]
*  Yeah, he likes people. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=134.38s)]
*  He's able to strike up conversations quickly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  And I was very shy growing up, so the first thing I concluded was, I'm never going to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=140.10000000000002s)]
*  be able to do that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=144.26s)]
*  So this is like a superpower that he has that I don't. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=145.74s)]
*  And I thought I would have to go in a different direction. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=150.3s)]
*  I also grew up wanting to be a fiction writer. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  I was really obsessed with that growing up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=157.34s)]
*  And then when I got out of college, I realized that the only thing I really knew how to do [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=160.3s)]
*  was his job, because I had watched it so much growing up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=165.54s)]
*  And so it was something that would keep me at least tangentially in the writing business. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=170.9s)]
*  So I got into it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  And only over time did I really appreciate the way they did reporting back then. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  It was a much different thing than what people do now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=186.3s)]
*  Did you think it was honorable? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  Like when you were a kid, did you think like my dad does something embarrassing or my dad [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=190.18s)]
*  does something important and useful? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=193.26s)]
*  No, I thought what he did was important, useful and honest. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=195.26000000000002s)]
*  And there was something very egalitarian about the way reporters carried themselves once [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=201.3s)]
*  upon a time. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  Only now are journalists universally culled from the Ivy Leagues and these upper class [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=210.66s)]
*  schools. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=217.06s)]
*  In fact, I was part of that generation of sort of rich kids who went into journalism. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=218.06s)]
*  When my father went into it, he started when he was 18, journalism was more of a trade [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=222.5s)]
*  than a profession. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=228.34s)]
*  It wasn't necessary to have a college education. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=230.46s)]
*  And most of the people who went into it, they had kind of a natural antipathy for people [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=233.18s)]
*  in power. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=238.7s)]
*  They overwhelmingly sided with the ordinary person, just reflexively. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=240.7s)]
*  And they were, you know, they told the news from that perspective very often, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=246.74s)]
*  The classic editorialist at the time was somebody like, you know, Jimmy Breslin or Mike Royko, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=253.10000000000002s)]
*  this sort of voice of the people kind of a thing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=260.38s)]
*  And so I grew up always imagining that the reporter was somebody who was on the side [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=263.14s)]
*  of ordinary people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=268.0s)]
*  Because he was one. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=269.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=270.74s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=271.74s)]
*  And, you know, my father carried it that way for sure. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=272.74s)]
*  And so I... [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=275.98s)]
*  Did your father never go to college? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=277.5s)]
*  No, he did. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  He went to Rutgers. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=280.58s)]
*  He had me while he was at Rutgers. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=282.7s)]
*  That's why he had to go into reporting. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=284.34s)]
*  He worked at the home news in New Brunswick, New Jersey. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=287.73999999999995s)]
*  And then, you know, as soon as he graduated, he went to the TV. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=293.73999999999995s)]
*  But no, I always had this vision of journalism as this thing that, you know, it wasn't for [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=298.78s)]
*  intellectuals. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=305.17999999999995s)]
*  And for the people who had graduate degrees, it was for people who hustled, who worked [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=306.18s)]
*  hard and had, you know, kind of a common touch. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=313.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=317.22s)]
*  Like that's kind of the key to the job is being willing to listen to people and all [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=318.22s)]
*  that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=321.02s)]
*  So I had a very specific idea of what journalism was when I went into it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=322.02s)]
*  I just thought I wasn't going to be particularly good at it because of that, you know, deficit. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=327.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  I didn't have that gift that he had. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=334.46s)]
*  But I started overseas in Russia. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=337.14s)]
*  And because I was able to, I spoke Russian already early, I had an advantage over other [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=340.9s)]
*  American reporters at the time. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=345.97999999999996s)]
*  What year did you go to Russia? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  So I studied in 89 and 90 when it was still Soviet. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=350.14s)]
*  You know, it was like took a year and a half abroad and then went back as soon as I graduated. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=355.14s)]
*  I went back before I graduated and started stringing and working for a bunch of different [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=361.94s)]
*  organizations there and finally got a job at an expat. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=368.42s)]
*  So 91 ish? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=371.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=372.18s)]
*  91 ish 92 right after the revolution, basically. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=373.18s)]
*  Which was in 91. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=377.14s)]
*  August. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=378.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=379.14s)]
*  Summer. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=380.14s)]
*  August 91. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=381.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=382.14s)]
*  So shortly after that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=383.14s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=384.14s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=385.14s)]
*  It was the wild west, you know, I mean, the funny thing for me is people ask me, why did [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=386.14s)]
*  I love Russia so much? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=390.22s)]
*  The first reason was, is that all my favorite writers growing up are Russians and my Nikolai [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=391.70000000000005s)]
*  Gogol was my hero. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=397.06s)]
*  I wanted to be a comic novelist and the Russians have so many amazingly funny writers as you [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=398.26000000000005s)]
*  know, right? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=404.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=405.18s)]
*  From Bulgakov to, you know, to Dovlata of all these people. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=406.18s)]
*  I wanted to learn the language. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=409.38000000000005s)]
*  Then when I got there, I had been a very depressed teenager, had struggled socially, behaved [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=412.14000000000004s)]
*  really all these other things. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=418.66s)]
*  I got to late Soviet Russia and everybody's depressed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=419.97999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, nobody's happy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=425.34s)]
*  And I thought this is amazing. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=427.58s)]
*  I fit right in. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=429.29999999999995s)]
*  And you want a dark Slavic soul and you didn't even know it? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=430.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=433.58s)]
*  And, you know, in America, there's this incredible pressure on young people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=434.65999999999997s)]
*  You have to succeed right away. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=438.73999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  Cheerful. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=441.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Be cheerful. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  Look good. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  Be in shape like all these other things. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=444.65999999999997s)]
*  Russians, no way. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  There was none of that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=447.06s)]
*  Nobody was going anywhere. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=448.54s)]
*  And when I got there, that was just incredibly attractive to me. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=450.02s)]
*  And so, you know, I've never heard that take before. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=454.82s)]
*  That is awesome. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=460.62s)]
*  No, it was really funny. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=461.62s)]
*  And because of that, you know, I got along with Russians in a way probably that other [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=463.22s)]
*  Americans didn't. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=468.5s)]
*  You know, I think there was a connection there that was that was very natural. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=469.5s)]
*  And I really took to the place early on. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=473.78s)]
*  How did you speak the language? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=476.42s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's like anybody who could come to the United States, if you have no [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=478.26s)]
*  choice and you have to speak English, you learn it pretty quickly. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=482.7s)]
*  So I studied in St. Petersburg, but then I briefly went to Uzbekistan because I had this [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=486.7s)]
*  idea that there weren't that many stringers in Uzbekistan. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=496.18s)]
*  So I would get more work. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=499.5s)]
*  And those who don't notice, I don't know that there are stringers anymore. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=500.5s)]
*  What's a stringer? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  A stringer is like a person who is not on staff for a newspaper, but just sort of sits [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=504.5s)]
*  in a place and waits for something to happen. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=511.29999999999995s)]
*  And then, you know, like the New York Times or the AP will call them and say, hey, can [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=513.38s)]
*  you can you chase down that, you know, thing that happened in my case, an earthquake that [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=517.42s)]
*  happened in Kyrgyzstan gave me an early chance to write a couple of stories. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=523.54s)]
*  And who'd you write them for? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=528.42s)]
*  I think I wrote one for AP in 1991. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=530.38s)]
*  I ended up getting thrown out of Uzbekistan because I had a bad visa. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=536.06s)]
*  But while I was there, I really learned Russian because nobody there spoke English. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=541.42s)]
*  And I also was on the Uzbek national baseball team, which was hilarious. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=547.54s)]
*  How? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=552.06s)]
*  So one day I was walking past one of the colleges and I saw people playing baseball and I was [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=553.06s)]
*  going to keep walking. And then I thought, I mean, Uzbekistan, what what is that? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=558.38s)]
*  It turned out that there was I think it was like a refrigeration school and there were a [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=562.7s)]
*  whole bunch of students from Cuba. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=568.46s)]
*  And, you know, those guys could really play. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=570.82s)]
*  Right. So I just went and asked, you guys mind if I play with you? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=573.58s)]
*  And so I ended up being a catcher on a team full of Cubans with a Russian coach. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=578.26s)]
*  And we played other Central Asian countries and it was hilarious. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=585.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we had we had ground rules. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=590.42s)]
*  This is going to sound like a fake story, but it's true. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=592.3s)]
*  We had ground rules when we played in a pasture. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=594.9399999999999s)]
*  If you hit a sheep, it was a double. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=598.5s)]
*  I'm sorry. If you had a cow, it was a double. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=600.6999999999999s)]
*  If you had a sheep, it was a triple. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=602.46s)]
*  That is a true story. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=604.9399999999999s)]
*  Did anyone ever hit a cow or sheep? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=606.14s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=607.98s)]
*  Not we only played like two games in that place. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=609.66s)]
*  So but but that actually happened. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=611.8199999999999s)]
*  I was actually playing baseball when I when I got thrown out of the country. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=614.22s)]
*  So Uzbekistan in 1991 was not a first world place. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=618.22s)]
*  No Uzbekistan was, you know, it's kind of a typical Soviet [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=621.9s)]
*  Soviet satellite country. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=627.1s)]
*  It was really struggling economically. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=628.5s)]
*  It had all kinds of problems, you know, environmentally, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=630.38s)]
*  you know, used to be the big cotton producer for the Soviet Union. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=635.82s)]
*  And then, you know, they that sort of dried up for a variety of reasons. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=638.94s)]
*  The Sea of Azov is now gone. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=643.66s)]
*  Right. So it was a troubled place. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=645.66s)]
*  There was a war going on in Tajikistan right next to us. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=650.06s)]
*  And so it was an interesting place to be. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=655.18s)]
*  But, you know, it was sort of my first experience. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=658.74s)]
*  What is your parents think? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=661.26s)]
*  My mother was terrified. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=663.1s)]
*  When I when I got thrown out of the country, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=666.1s)]
*  I got a visit by these people who were, I guess, there were. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=669.18s)]
*  The first one I was there for was the SNB, the the Sluzba Nazinalnaya [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=673.1s)]
*  Bezoposnosti, which is just the their version of the KGB. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=677.74s)]
*  And they asked me for my papers. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=682.1s)]
*  I had the wrong papers. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=684.86s)]
*  I was there in a student visa that I had kind of, you know, was kind of phony. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=685.9s)]
*  And but I had to send a telegram [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=690.0600000000001s)]
*  telling my parents that I had been kicked out of the country. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=693.34s)]
*  So I wrote KGB kicking me out. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  We'll call for Moscow. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=698.98s)]
*  But she got KGB kicking me gut. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=700.7s)]
*  We'll call when I get to Moscow. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=704.1400000000001s)]
*  So she was worried. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=708.5s)]
*  But but no, it was fine. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=710.7s)]
*  But your dad was for it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=713.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think he he thought the whole, you know, adventure thing was interesting. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=714.7800000000001s)]
*  And then when he finally visited Russia in the mid 90s, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=719.74s)]
*  you know, and saw what the place was like at the time, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=723.9000000000001s)]
*  he thought it was, you know, a paradise for journalists, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=727.14s)]
*  which it was because there was so much crazy stuff going on. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=730.1s)]
*  And it was a great place to learn the profession, really. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=735.62s)]
*  Yeah. What was press freedom like then? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=739.78s)]
*  It was really interesting. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=743.18s)]
*  There was a very vibrant community of [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=744.7s)]
*  really hardcore, great investigative reporters [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=748.66s)]
*  who suddenly appeared out of nowhere because remember, the press had been [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=751.62s)]
*  suppressed almost completely for, you know, 80 years. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=755.86s)]
*  Right. And after as soon as there was a, you know, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=759.9s)]
*  a little bit of an opening to do real reporting, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=763.98s)]
*  there were suddenly these very brave reporters who showed up. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=768.3s)]
*  And, you know, they were they were risking their lives every time they wrote, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=772.78s)]
*  because the way the system was set up was that every newspaper [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=776.3s)]
*  was basically owned by a different gangster. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=779.5s)]
*  And you would get material, they called it selling jeans over there. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=782.58s)]
*  Right. So somebody would get give you a a packet of information. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=787.46s)]
*  You would write it up about the rival gangland figure or politician. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=791.98s)]
*  And then, but if they wanted you to pay the price, you would, you know, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=797.86s)]
*  you might get shot in a doorway or something like that. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=801.26s)]
*  So there were people who got killed by exploding briefcases. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=804.14s)]
*  For instance, there was a guy named Dima Holoduff, who worked for [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=807.82s)]
*  Moscow, he comes to Mollets when I was there, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=811.9000000000001s)]
*  who had written about Yeltsin's defense minister. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=814.14s)]
*  He got blown up in a train station. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=816.58s)]
*  But, you know, the Russians, those guys were my heroes. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=819.38s)]
*  I tagged on to a bunch of those people really early. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=822.94s)]
*  And that's really kind of really learned the whole [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=827.7800000000001s)]
*  investigative journalism thing was from those people, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=830.7s)]
*  you know, not all of whom stayed in the business for very long, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=834.14s)]
*  sometimes not voluntarily. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=838.3000000000001s)]
*  You stayed 10 years. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=839.5400000000001s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. How come? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=840.98s)]
*  I mean, I love the place I was planning on staying forever, really. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=843.82s)]
*  You know, then things definitely turned weird [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=849.14s)]
*  when the transformation from Yeltsin to Putin happened. Yes. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=853.22s)]
*  You know, we all none of us had any illusions about who Putin was. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=859.0600000000001s)]
*  Putin was a known quantity. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=862.1s)]
*  He was the deputy mayor of St. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=863.3000000000001s)]
*  Petersburg when I was a student in St. Petersburg. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=864.62s)]
*  And he was kind of known as [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=866.9000000000001s)]
*  well, I mean, there were all sorts of stories that were told about him back then. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=871.2600000000001s)]
*  And when he first came to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=875.58s)]
*  to power in Moscow, it was sort of widely understood that he was doing it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=878.7800000000001s)]
*  And Yeltsin even writes about this in his biography [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=882.82s)]
*  because Yeltsin needed help getting out of the country and escaping prosecution. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=885.7800000000001s)]
*  And there there had been some indication [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=891.46s)]
*  that Putin had done that for his previous boss, the mayor of St. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=895.86s)]
*  Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=898.98s)]
*  So, you know, the sort of investigative [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=901.1s)]
*  journalism community was very suspicious of Putin when he when he first arrived. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=904.74s)]
*  But the Western journalism community loved him. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=910.42s)]
*  And this was there. Yeah. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=914.0600000000001s)]
*  And this was, you know, I had already become disillusioned [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=916.34s)]
*  with American journalism before that for because they had misreported [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=919.74s)]
*  a lot of things about post-communist Russia. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=923.9s)]
*  But that was kind of the last straw for me. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=926.34s)]
*  I think traditionally think tanks do a lot of thinking. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=928.3s)]
*  And the Heritage Foundation still does that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=931.38s)]
*  But it also thankfully has begun doing. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=933.02s)]
*  Heritage has built a massive investigative and litigation operation [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=936.6999999999999s)]
*  out of its headquarters to save this country from the corruption [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=941.4599999999999s)]
*  that is taking it over, both actual literal corruption, financial corruption. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=945.3s)]
*  There's a lot of that, but also ideological and moral corruption. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=950.1s)]
*  And to fight back, Heritage is engaging in almost 50 separate lawsuits [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=953.38s)]
*  against various government entities to try and pry out information [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=957.74s)]
*  to bring a little sunlight to the process that even Congress can't get. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=960.74s)]
*  And it's been working. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=963.94s)]
*  They produce documents exposing the Biden crime family to the rest of the world. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=965.22s)]
*  You've read those stories and help kill the sweetheart deal [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=969.3000000000001s)]
*  that Biden's DOJ tried to make with his son, Hunter Biden. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=972.4200000000001s)]
*  Heritage has also developed a comprehensive plan to dismantle [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=976.7s)]
*  the deep state, the swamp, by staffing the next administration [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=979.54s)]
*  with people who know what they're doing. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=983.66s)]
*  Thousands of Americans who on day one can start to make this country better. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=985.26s)]
*  So it's important work. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=990.66s)]
*  Again, it's not just thinking, it's doing. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=991.98s)]
*  And if you want to support it, go to heritage.org. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=993.9s)]
*  Can you back up one click? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=998.62s)]
*  What did they misreport? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1000.86s)]
*  So they would they would send somebody out to some provincial town like Samara, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1002.42s)]
*  with an assignment, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1008.9s)]
*  find the thriving emerging middle class. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1012.54s)]
*  Right. And so you'd go out to a place where there's like a barter economy. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1017.1s)]
*  Yeah. And people are doing subsistence farming, you know, and they would [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1021.1s)]
*  they would ask around until they found somebody who had, you know, a VCR [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1025.7s)]
*  or who had been on a vacation to Ibiza once or something like that. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1030.94s)]
*  And then they would do a whole story like, you know, transition to capitalism. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1034.62s)]
*  You know, flourishing. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1038.78s)]
*  You know, the emerging middle class is, you know, everything's [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1041.38s)]
*  happening right on schedule. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1044.7s)]
*  And meanwhile, the country was really in the yeltsin years, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1046.42s)]
*  was really doing very badly, right. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1049.34s)]
*  It's in contrast to now. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1051.1s)]
*  You know, Russia was experiencing sort of record levels of early deaths. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1054.7s)]
*  Yes. All kinds of horrific things that they weren't telling people back home. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1059.58s)]
*  And so. Why? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1066.0600000000002s)]
*  Because the the the expec community and, you know, I [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1068.46s)]
*  I don't really know exactly how this works, but there was a monoculture [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1071.8600000000001s)]
*  about the reporting there that is very similar to what it's like now in America. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1076.26s)]
*  But there it was sort of cartoonized. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1081.74s)]
*  It's a very small community. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1084.5400000000002s)]
*  Everybody knew everybody else. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1086.0600000000002s)]
*  And, you know, whatever the Washington Post and the New York Times wrote about, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1088.1000000000001s)]
*  pretty much everybody else followed their lead. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1093.18s)]
*  There was almost nobody among the reporters who even spoke Russian. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1095.94s)]
*  Right. That was totally discouraged. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1101.0600000000002s)]
*  How can you cover a country if you don't speak the language? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1103.5s)]
*  Because that was the tradition. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1105.9s)]
*  I mean, if people would come in, they would cycle in there for a few years. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1107.38s)]
*  They would work with translators. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1111.02s)]
*  They stayed in a little compound on Kutuzovsky Prospekt, which is, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1112.7s)]
*  you know, right near the center of the city. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1116.38s)]
*  In the Soviet days, it was sort of walled off by by design. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1119.3000000000002s)]
*  But they continued living there for some reason that I didn't really understand. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1122.78s)]
*  And with a couple of exceptions, you know, I can think there was a Boston [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1127.7s)]
*  Globe reporter who was fantastic, right, while I was there. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1130.86s)]
*  But for the most part, you know, people came in and they they just treated it [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1134.3s)]
*  as a, you know, as a third world backwater. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1138.5s)]
*  It's like, you know, if you read The Quiet American, it was it was that attitude. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1141.18s)]
*  But I don't understand. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1145.54s)]
*  So if you don't speak a language, I mean, I've lived here for 55 years. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1146.94s)]
*  I speak English as a native speaker. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1151.38s)]
*  Barely understand the country. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1154.14s)]
*  It's just too complicated. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1155.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1156.66s)]
*  But if you can't speak the language, you just don't understand it at all. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1157.0600000000002s)]
*  You have no hope of understanding it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1160.74s)]
*  Do you? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1162.5800000000002s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1164.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1165.3400000000001s)]
*  And this was not just the journalists, but also the diplomats there. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1165.8200000000002s)]
*  But, you know, this was the diplomats didn't speak Russian. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1170.14s)]
*  Diplomats didn't speak Russian. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1172.22s)]
*  You're, you know, we have a the ambassador to to to Russia, Michael McFaul. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1173.42s)]
*  He couldn't he could barely do put a sentence together in Russian. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1178.8999999999999s)]
*  So it was. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1182.1s)]
*  What is that? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1183.86s)]
*  That just seems like a baseline requirement. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1184.74s)]
*  So the way it was explained to us was that this was something that was a hang [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1187.06s)]
*  over from the American diplomatic experience in China before the Maoist [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1192.1799999999998s)]
*  revolution, where the diplomats were deemed to have been too close to the local [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1197.78s)]
*  population didn't warn the people back home what was happening. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1201.8999999999999s)]
*  So they made a habit out of cycling people from spot to spot so that they [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1208.18s)]
*  wouldn't become too accustomed to the culture or to acculturated, right. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1214.58s)]
*  Uh, which I can maybe see the rationale for a diplomat, maybe, but for a [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1220.1399999999999s)]
*  journalist, it makes no sense at all. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1225.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1227.66s)]
*  So, um, to not, to not understand the, the place that you're reporting on. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1227.94s)]
*  Um, so by then, I, you know, I, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1234.58s)]
*  it doesn't make sense to not understand the place you're reporting on that. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1237.86s)]
*  And I think either we can agree on that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1240.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1241.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1242.1s)]
*  But so, so it was, it was a strange activity that a lot of them were [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1242.42s)]
*  involved in where they, they mostly interviewed the English speaking [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1247.7s)]
*  officials in the Yeltsin government. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1252.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1254.74s)]
*  Uh, a lot of them had gone to Harvard. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1255.1s)]
*  Um, and they were getting one very specific version of what Russia was [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1257.66s)]
*  going through, what its challenges were. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1263.06s)]
*  And at the time, by then I had already branched off. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1265.5s)]
*  I had left, um, the ex-pat paper, the Moscow times. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1268.82s)]
*  I started up my own newspaper, which was like a nightlife guide. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1273.06s)]
*  And I started doing this thing in opposition to that, which was, I would [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1276.78s)]
*  go around the country getting jobs in weird places, like I, I was, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1282.06s)]
*  worked as a bricklayer in Siberia. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1286.1399999999999s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I did, um, I worked at a monastery in Mordovia. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1288.86s)]
*  What did you do in the monastery? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1295.1399999999999s)]
*  At construction, you know? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1296.58s)]
*  Um, so we'll just tour the country and kind of find out exactly how people, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1298.26s)]
*  uh, were doing what, what the situation was like. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1303.46s)]
*  And it was an amazing discovery because every, every place I went, I learned [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1306.5s)]
*  about a new lie that was being told, you know, to people back home and it, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1312.18s)]
*  it was deeply disillusioning for me. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1317.46s)]
*  I mean, I know you've had experiences like this in journalism too, right? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1319.74s)]
*  Where you find out that something you thought is totally wrong. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1323.5s)]
*  And, um, and that was a real eyeopener for me. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1327.54s)]
*  Completely wrong. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1331.62s)]
*  Completely wrong. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1332.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1333.5s)]
*  And, and moreover that was proven relatively quickly, right? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1334.34s)]
*  There was a massive financial collapse in 98 and then Putin came in. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1338.54s)]
*  Uh, and there was a huge popular repudiation of, you know, so the American [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1344.06s)]
*  style, um, version of managed democracy that existed under Yeltsin. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1351.98s)]
*  And that was real. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1360.66s)]
*  I mean, Putin for all, for all of his, uh, problems, and I was a real critic [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1362.3s)]
*  of Putin's when I was there, uh, there was no question that he was much more [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1368.5s)]
*  popular than, than Yeltsin, you know, the country was very embarrassed by Yeltsin. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1372.06s)]
*  Um, because he was publicly drunk all the time. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1376.54s)]
*  He was dysfunctional. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1379.7s)]
*  I mean, I think we're, we're living through some of those emotions now. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1380.86s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1383.6999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1384.3s)]
*  He's shameful. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1384.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1385.5s)]
*  And, and so they, they wanted to, you know, their word was a seal nail, right? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1385.9399999999998s)]
*  They wanted a strong hand, uh, who would come in and kind of set things right. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1390.9799999999998s)]
*  And, and compete with the Americans and they didn't, they didn't like being [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1396.1s)]
*  thought of as a vassal state to the West. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1399.78s)]
*  This is an ancient conflict for Russia and America. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1402.1s)]
*  This goes back to the days of Peter the great, uh, you know, the [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1405.78s)]
*  slavophiles versus the roof, uh, the Western, uh, you know, the people, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1409.86s)]
*  the pro-Western crew and it, the pendulum swung the other way while I was there, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1414.1399999999999s)]
*  you know, and, um, that was, you know, fascinating to watch, but it had some [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1419.9399999999998s)]
*  pretty serious consequences too. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1424.9399999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah, that turned out to be right. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1427.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1429.5s)]
*  So, but as for journalism, like you, you began to become disillusioned with it, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1429.78s)]
*  the American version in the nineties. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1435.4199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1437.58s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1438.22s)]
*  While I, while I was in Russia, um, I became disillusioned both with the format [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1439.14s)]
*  of it, you know, the, the kind of neutral third person, uh, version of reporting [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1445.66s)]
*  where we pretend we're not having a point of view. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1452.42s)]
*  Um, I didn't like that, you know, like for instance, I would get sent out when [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1455.0200000000002s)]
*  I was at the Moscow times, which was a paper I loved, but they would send me to [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1459.8200000000002s)]
*  all these events, uh, where funny things would happen, I would come back and write [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1463.7800000000002s)]
*  up with humor and they would tell me to take out the humor and write it in some [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1468.02s)]
*  other way that was like more serious. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1471.26s)]
*  And I think that's a lie, right? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1473.66s)]
*  Like if you, if you go to a scene that's funny, like for instance, I had to cover [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1476.34s)]
*  this ridiculous press conference where Prince Philip appeared for, I think the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1480.06s)]
*  world wildlife fund or something like that. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1484.78s)]
*  And he's giving a speech to all these Russians about, you know, their backward [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1487.7s)]
*  attitudes about conservation and everything. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1491.58s)]
*  And in the middle of the speech, the hotel brings the spread, which includes [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1494.3s)]
*  booze and all the reporters get up and leave Prince Philip talking by himself [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1498.7s)]
*  while they, while they just eat all the food and drink and drink all the booze. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1503.82s)]
*  And to me, that's the story. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1507.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1509.02s)]
*  You know, so I went home and I wrote that up and they, you know, they kind of wanted [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1509.82s)]
*  me to do something else. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1513.42s)]
*  Like pretend it didn't happen. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1514.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1515.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1516.06s)]
*  And I thought, well, this, you know, this isn't right. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1516.86s)]
*  You know, I mean, I was just a kid. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1519.3s)]
*  I didn't really know, but I thought there's something not quite right about this. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1520.62s)]
*  So to what extent in retrospect, do you think that Western news organizations [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1524.4199999999998s)]
*  were taking their cues from Western businesses or Western governments? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1528.3s)]
*  Oh, I mean, 90%, 95%. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1533.46s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1537.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1538.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1539.06s)]
*  I mean, if you go back and look at the coverage of, you know, the New York [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1539.4199999999998s)]
*  Times, the Washington Post, you know, some other organizations, you know, the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1545.34s)]
*  current deputy prime minister of Canada, Christia Freeland was sort of a colleague [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1550.14s)]
*  at the time, she was part of that whole crew of Western journalists there. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1554.94s)]
*  What was she like? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1558.74s)]
*  Well, they were all doing kind of the same thing. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1560.9s)]
*  Like the basic line was that there was a new group of robber bearing [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1563.3400000000001s)]
*  capitalists who had appeared. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1568.66s)]
*  Um, and yes, it was messy. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1571.42s)]
*  It was a messy transition to capitalism was the, was the word they used for it. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1574.38s)]
*  Now, actually it was just pure gangsterism. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1577.98s)]
*  And most of the people who got rich did so through absolutely corrupt [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1580.34s)]
*  privatization schemes were like, for instance, there was a thing called [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1585.42s)]
*  loans for shares, but the government was literally lending the money to cronies [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1589.58s)]
*  so that they could buy companies like Exxon for pennies on the dollar. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1593.5s)]
*  You know, I mean, like Yukos for instance, was a gigantic oil company worth, you [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1596.78s)]
*  know, as much as any Western oil company would be worth, they bought it for nothing [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1601.98s)]
*  basically for, for a pittance because they were pals of the people in government. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1606.78s)]
*  So they created an instant billionaire class and that was completely passed over. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1612.5s)]
*  Nobody reported on that. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1616.66s)]
*  Um, then once these people had a money, uh, they were treated as sort of [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1618.3799999999999s)]
*  a legitimate wealth creators and, you know, yeah, exactly. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1626.1s)]
*  They didn't, they weren't even with the robber barons who at least like built [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1632.22s)]
*  railroads, right? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1636.42s)]
*  You know, like these guys didn't do anything except steal, you know, they, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1638.02s)]
*  they were wealth extractors and, um, and it was amazing watching the hype of, uh, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1642.3000000000002s)]
*  uh, of these figures, the, the whitewashing of Yeltsin's complete misrule, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1651.5800000000002s)]
*  his, um, uh, you know, his brutalizing of domestic journalists, right? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1658.5s)]
*  I mean, like the, there was a ton of that going on in the nineties, long [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1665.06s)]
*  before Putin came to office and became infamous from the, yes, there were so [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1668.46s)]
*  many journalists who were killed before Putin came to life under Yeltsin. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1671.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1675.82s)]
*  The guy I mentioned Putin kills journalists. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1676.1s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1678.1399999999999s)]
*  This, this started, this started from the very beginning. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1679.34s)]
*  They were doing this. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1682.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, that guy I told you about with the exploding briefcase, that was 1994. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1683.26s)]
*  When that happened, um, you know, there were, uh, there were, there were a lot. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1686.78s)]
*  I had a friend, not exactly a friend, somebody I knew well, Alexander Hinshstein, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1691.3799999999999s)]
*  who also worked for a newspaper there. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1696.42s)]
*  He got thrown in a mental institution, uh, in the Yeltsin years. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1698.7s)]
*  Um, there were, there were all sorts of reporters shot. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1703.14s)]
*  If you go in and, and shot, killed, beaten. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1706.5s)]
*  Um, you know, I had another friend named, uh, Leonid Krutakov, uh, who was not only [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1710.5s)]
*  fired every time he did an expose, but you know, he, he would be attacked. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1716.3799999999999s)]
*  He had somebody come through his window one night, if I remember correctly. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1719.94s)]
*  Um, so it was a dangerous profession before Putin came to office. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1723.5s)]
*  Now, obviously it went to a new level once he came in and, you know, there [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1728.66s)]
*  were people I knew who died, right. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1733.6200000000001s)]
*  Um, you know, in the years after he, he became president, but it wasn't an [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1735.98s)]
*  appreciably different vibe for journalists. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1742.18s)]
*  The diff, the difference was that they, that Putin concentrated government [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1745.2199999999998s)]
*  authority in a way that had not been done previously before it was more of [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1750.1s)]
*  like a gangland free for all. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1755.1s)]
*  Putin came in, he took over the last remaining independent [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1757.2199999999998s)]
*  television station, uh, and TV. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1760.1399999999999s)]
*  Um, he had the, one of the oligarchs arrested, uh, Vladimir Gussinsky and, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1763.34s)]
*  you know, the, the owner of a bank, Menatep, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, famously [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1770.78s)]
*  put in jail, uh, you know, they were sponsors of media as well. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1778.18s)]
*  So, uh, but the only thing that was different is that the government was [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1781.5s)]
*  exerting sort of overt control over, over media and they were, they were [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1786.38s)]
*  stamping out the individual pockets of opposition. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1790.94s)]
*  So during the Eltsin years, it was very dangerous. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1794.66s)]
*  You just, you did still have some freedom to do really good work. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1796.74s)]
*  And that's why those, those people were amazing. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1800.18s)]
*  Like, you know, they were risking everything every time they did a story [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1802.8600000000001s)]
*  and they were still doing it. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1806.42s)]
*  They just had, they had such balls. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1807.66s)]
*  It was, it was incredible to watch. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1809.3400000000001s)]
*  And then the contrast, by the way, with between that and the, and the [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1812.9s)]
*  Americans, right, was, was just so striking for me. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1815.7s)]
*  But why would American journalists be providing cover for Yeltsin or [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1819.66s)]
*  ignoring the downside of Yeltsin? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1824.54s)]
*  So some of it was cultural, you know, you come in, you don't speak the language. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1827.5s)]
*  It's a temporary assignment. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1832.22s)]
*  You're hanging around with a bunch of other Westerners and so you don't see. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1833.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1837.58s)]
*  Like that, that was a very typical thing. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1837.94s)]
*  The few reporters who, you know, spoke the language and, or, you know, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1840.22s)]
*  married Russian women, right. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1845.3799999999999s)]
*  Or, or were Russian men. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1847.06s)]
*  Um, they were better, right. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1849.1399999999999s)]
*  Because they were, they were at least in tune to what was going on in the country. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1852.06s)]
*  But Moscow was still in St. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1854.86s)]
*  Petersburg were like a different country compared to what was [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1857.22s)]
*  going on in the rest of Russia. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1859.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1861.78s)]
*  You could be in Moscow and it would seem like a more or less functional place. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1861.94s)]
*  You go 40 miles outside of the city. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1867.42s)]
*  And again, there's subsistence farming, you know, and, or there's whole stretches [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1869.54s)]
*  where there's no government and people are just setting up toll roads, uh, you [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1875.34s)]
*  know, they're, they're putting on camera, uh, fatigues and creating their own toll [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1879.82s)]
*  booths. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1884.7s)]
*  Um, so it's like Beirut. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1885.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1886.98s)]
*  And, and, but if you didn't know, if you didn't go out, you wouldn't see it, you [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1887.94s)]
*  know, so I think that was, it was a problem with perception for a lot of these folks. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1892.3799999999999s)]
*  And, um, but I thought it was inexcusable because, you know, as a reporter, your [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1896.54s)]
*  first job is to, is to find out, you know, to check for yourself. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1904.1399999999999s)]
*  Uh, and how were you treated by government there? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1909.06s)]
*  So the, we had a unique position because we were publishing in Russia. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1912.34s)]
*  So unlike all those other reporters, American reporters, I was technically a [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1919.1799999999998s)]
*  Russian news organization. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1923.9799999999998s)]
*  We had a Russian newspaper, we had a Russian business, right? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1925.58s)]
*  So even though we were in, in English, we were regulated by, uh, you know, the, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1929.9799999999998s)]
*  the, the Russian government. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1934.9399999999998s)]
*  Um, we got visited every now and then by the tax police asking for bribes. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1936.9399999999998s)]
*  And then, um, after, after I left, they eventually shut the paper down. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1941.6999999999998s)]
*  Uh, so, uh, but they, you know, they paid attention to us, but it wasn't the same [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1946.6999999999998s)]
*  as, um, the way they paid attention to, you know, the New York times and other [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1955.26s)]
*  reporters, I mean, there were people who were Paul Klevnikov, remember that name? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1960.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1963.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1964.34s)]
*  So he got, he got shot right. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1964.66s)]
*  Um, while he was there and I don't, I don't know that it was a Russian [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1966.94s)]
*  government interest that did that, but they were paying attention to coverage [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1971.46s)]
*  that went out overseas. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1975.3799999999999s)]
*  They weren't, they didn't care so much about what I was doing, which was writing [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1978.06s)]
*  for people who are in Russia and, uh, you know, and also we were writing in English. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1981.02s)]
*  So God knows how many Russian officials even understanding what we were doing. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1986.18s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1991.58s)]
*  So how did, um, well, first of all, why'd you leave? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1992.9s)]
*  Well, um, it became harder and harder. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=1998.22s)]
*  The, the expert community shrank, uh, when Putin came to power, which [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2001.66s)]
*  killed our advertiser base. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2007.14s)]
*  Um, and, uh, I, I, we had a humor newspaper that was sort of loosely based on. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2008.98s)]
*  Like a cross between spy magazine and screw. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2018.02s)]
*  And I, I kind of thought that we had, you know, run the course creatively while [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2020.54s)]
*  I was there, um, and, you know, at some point I just wanted to come home, but, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2027.18s)]
*  um, but also, you know, it had kind of turned nasty. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2033.1399999999999s)]
*  Uh, you know, some of the people who I knew, I, like, I vaguely knew Anna [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2037.02s)]
*  Polikovskaya for instance, who got killed while I was there. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2043.3799999999999s)]
*  And there was another reporter who was sort of a mentor to me. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2046.5s)]
*  This guy, Yuri Shikachikin, who became a, um, a Duma deputy. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2049.14s)]
*  Uh, he died under mysterious circumstances. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2053.94s)]
*  Some people said it was a poison telephone. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2057.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, who knows, right? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2060.02s)]
*  But, um, it got kind of unpleasant. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2061.18s)]
*  Um, and. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2064.54s)]
*  You know, I, the, the community was just not as big as it had been in the, in the [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2067.18s)]
*  nineties, I mean, Moscow in the late nineties was an incredible scene. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2073.98s)]
*  It was like Chicago in the thirties. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2077.22s)]
*  It's, it's, it's very difficult to describe what it was actually like. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2078.78s)]
*  Um, you know, gangsters everywhere, bodies, you know, all over the place, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2083.7000000000003s)]
*  people being thrown out of windows. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2087.5400000000004s)]
*  There were terrorist explosions happening all the time. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2089.38s)]
*  It was, it was a wild place to be. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2091.9s)]
*  Uh, and you know, that, that story kind of ran its course while I was, while I was [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2095.34s)]
*  there and the city started to transform into what you saw when you went. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2100.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2104.34s)]
*  The most functional city I've ever been in. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2104.6600000000003s)]
*  Which is so, it's so amazing for me to hear. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2106.5800000000004s)]
*  She was certainly shocking for me. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2108.78s)]
*  So this winter I'm standing in the kitchen with my dogs and my wife comes in. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2111.0600000000004s)]
*  She's just come back from a long walk and she has this look on her face, this look [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2114.5400000000004s)]
*  of tranquility and joy and peace. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2118.7400000000002s)]
*  And I said, what have you been doing? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2123.3s)]
*  And she said, I was praying. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2124.38s)]
*  And I said, where? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2125.86s)]
*  She said on my walk for an hour and a half. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2126.5s)]
*  And it turns out she was listening to something I'd never heard of before, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2130.38s)]
*  which is an app called Hello. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2132.7400000000002s)]
*  Hello. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2135.1400000000003s)]
*  H a L L O W. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2135.5800000000004s)]
*  Like how low and a friend of hers gave it to her. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2138.18s)]
*  And this set off a chain reaction in my family where pretty much everyone in my [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2141.8199999999997s)]
*  family started to listen to how low every day, it's a prayer app. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2145.8999999999996s)]
*  And it's the best way, as you know, to find peace. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2149.18s)]
*  And this makes it very easy to set aside the time to deeply pray every single day. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2151.58s)]
*  And I'm so impressed by how low that I tracked down the number of the CEO and I [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2158.2999999999997s)]
*  called him and I said, I want to advertise this on our podcast because it's something [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2162.02s)]
*  that I really believe in. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2165.5s)]
*  And I think you do an amazing job and it's basically non-denominational Christian. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2166.98s)]
*  You don't have to be Catholic or Protestant. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2170.82s)]
*  You can be any kind of Christian, but Hello will help you focus your prayer in a way. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2172.06s)]
*  Um, that'll be very obvious to your husband when you walk into the kitchen. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2178.5s)]
*  I can promise you that. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2181.46s)]
*  Um, it's an amazing, amazing resource. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2183.2200000000003s)]
*  They've got like 10,000 audio guided prayers, meditations, Bible studies, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2185.54s)]
*  famously Mark Wahlberg leads one of them. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2190.34s)]
*  It's just really, really good. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2193.06s)]
*  You can download it for three months free at hallow.com slash Tucker. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2194.9s)]
*  And, uh, strongly recommend that you do that. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2199.74s)]
*  So you missed in the 10 years you were gone, the entire span of the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2203.06s)]
*  clinton years and nine 11. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2207.18s)]
*  And so I think it's fair to say it was a completely different country in 2002 [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2211.14s)]
*  from what it had been in 1992. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2215.34s)]
*  What did you think when you got back? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2217.66s)]
*  Um, well, I mean, I was, I was shocked when I got back and I was thinking about [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2219.5s)]
*  this just the other day because, you know, I think a lot now about kind of [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2225.02s)]
*  America's slide toward autocracy. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2228.74s)]
*  Cause I had this vision with the whole time I was there, I, you know, watching [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2232.22s)]
*  the Russian government in action was like getting this incredible advanced [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2236.02s)]
*  education into autocratic, autocratic methods and how things work. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2241.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2246.2599999999998s)]
*  How things work, right. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2246.7799999999997s)]
*  Um, you know, the jailing of political opponents, you know, on trumped up [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2248.2999999999997s)]
*  charges or, you know, blackmail and how things are leaked by the intelligence [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2252.4199999999996s)]
*  services, like that stuff just happens out in the open there. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2257.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2259.8999999999996s)]
*  And I always had this image that, well, in America that doesn't go on. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2260.62s)]
*  Um, and then I come home to post nine 11 America and the whole vibe is, well, we [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2264.9799999999996s)]
*  have to start throwing all of our democratic guarantees overboard because [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2272.78s)]
*  as I think as Dick Cheney put it, we have to start exploring the dark side. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2278.5800000000004s)]
*  Um, because you know, the bill of rights is inadequate to keep us safe. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2282.5s)]
*  We need to start doing, you know, all of these things that I thought were crazy. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2288.5s)]
*  You know, the Patriot act, the, the authorization use military force, right. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2292.7400000000002s)]
*  Like so, so moving the authority to declare war out of Congress to basically [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2297.58s)]
*  to the white house mass surveillance, uh, you know, Guantanamo Bay, all these [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2305.2599999999998s)]
*  things were really shocking to me. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2312.54s)]
*  And it was, it was kind of, I thought it was also ironic to come back from [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2314.98s)]
*  Russia to this developing situation. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2318.86s)]
*  And, um, so what year did you get back? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2320.94s)]
*  2002. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2323.8199999999997s)]
*  So was it clear to you then where the trajectory was headed? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2325.1s)]
*  Well, I thought there would be, I was really naive in retrospect. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2329.74s)]
*  I thought there, I took all of my sort of fellow political liberals seriously when [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2333.8199999999997s)]
*  they said they were, you know, ardently opposed to this secretive revolution, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2338.98s)]
*  right. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2346.46s)]
*  Uh, and the spy state and drone warfare and all these other things. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2346.98s)]
*  And when Barack Obama, the constitutional lawyer came along and there was this [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2351.94s)]
*  belief that a transfer, he would usher in a transformative presidency that would [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2357.6600000000003s)]
*  undo, you know, this cheney vision, which scared me, you know, uh, which I thought [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2362.7400000000002s)]
*  was, was sort of going to undo the schoolhouse rock version of America that [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2367.94s)]
*  I grew up believing in. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2372.46s)]
*  Um, and, uh, I believe, I believed it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2374.0200000000004s)]
*  I'm kind of embarrassed now. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2378.26s)]
*  I actually thought that was going to happen that when Barack Obama got elected [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2380.1s)]
*  at all, that would, would turn back. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2384.18s)]
*  Um, but in hindsight, you know, they never had any intention, it seems that, uh, of, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2387.82s)]
*  of changing anything. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2393.14s)]
*  If you go back and look at the statements, you know, they were saying things like, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2394.22s)]
*  well, we're not, we're not, we might not change the status quo right away. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2398.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2402.38s)]
*  Um, and I had, you know, I had been very positive about Barack Obama. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2402.94s)]
*  I covered him on the campaign trail. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2409.06s)]
*  Um, cause my job, by the way, I, when I came back, I lucked into getting the [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2410.98s)]
*  greatest job in journalism, which is covering campaigns for Rolling Stone. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2416.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2419.98s)]
*  And, um, and I, I was very impressed by Barack Obama. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2420.94s)]
*  I thought he was incredible. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2425.18s)]
*  Uh, but it was disillusioning to see what happened afterwards. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2427.2599999999998s)]
*  At what point did you realize he wasn't what you thought he was? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2430.98s)]
*  So, uh, right after he got elected, I got assigned to cover the causes of [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2434.46s)]
*  the financial crisis and which was funny because I had no background in finance. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2438.9s)]
*  I didn't have any clue what a mortgage backed security was or how any of that [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2443.94s)]
*  works. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2448.42s)]
*  Um, but one of the first things that happened was that, um, you know, I got [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2449.14s)]
*  calls from people in the democratic party who said, you should look at the [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2452.7000000000003s)]
*  president's relationship, the city group, um, and you know, how the city group [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2456.3s)]
*  bailout happened, you know, he put a city group executive who had been a college [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2462.54s)]
*  buddy of his in charge of his economic transition during which they gave a very, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2467.38s)]
*  you know, a sweetheart bailout deal to, uh, to, to city group. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2473.5s)]
*  And this was an early indication that, you know, this president was maybe not [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2478.46s)]
*  exactly what I thought he was. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2483.3s)]
*  Not transformative in the way you imagined. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2485.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2487.3s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2487.7400000000002s)]
*  And, and, um, even though Rolling Stone couldn't, they were over the [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2488.62s)]
*  moon about Obama, right. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2493.1400000000003s)]
*  Uh, that was true love. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2494.6600000000003s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2496.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2497.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2497.78s)]
*  It was almost erotic. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2497.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2499.1000000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2499.5s)]
*  I mean, everybody in, in liberal media loved Obama. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2500.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, but particularly at our magazine where, uh, you know, the, the people who [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2503.6600000000003s)]
*  owned it were, they were, they were just delirious about Obama. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2509.38s)]
*  And so when I came to them and I, and I said, look, I have to do this story about [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2513.98s)]
*  how this, this bailout situation is corrupt. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2518.26s)]
*  Um, they weren't pleased, but they ran. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2521.1000000000004s)]
*  If you can go back and look, you'll see that there's a story called Obama's big [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2523.5s)]
*  sellout, uh, it was like a 9,000 word feature that they let me run. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2526.34s)]
*  And, um, so that was like a year after he got into office, but that was kind of [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2531.06s)]
*  the beginning of, um, it basically said that, uh, that the Obama had run as an [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2537.38s)]
*  economic populist, um, and had talked a lot about reforming, uh, certain things [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2547.5s)]
*  that had gone on on wall street that had allowed, um, you know, the excesses [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2555.9s)]
*  of the mortgage bubble to happen. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2560.6600000000003s)]
*  And then as soon as, um, he got elected, he brought in all these acolytes, um, of, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2563.38s)]
*  uh, sorry, the Clinton's former treasury secretary, Rubin, Bob Rubin. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2572.5s)]
*  Uh, so there, there are all these Rubin was that city group. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2578.62s)]
*  Uh, Obama brought a whole bunch of people close to Bob Rubin into the government. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2584.5800000000004s)]
*  And, you know, these were the same kind of people who had caused the crash. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2589.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2595.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2595.38s)]
*  So to me, I wrote it as kind of a bait and switch, you know, he, he ran to [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2596.0600000000004s)]
*  somebody, he was going to change the system. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2600.1400000000003s)]
*  He brought in people who were the system. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2602.3s)]
*  And in addition, uh, there was this bailout deal with city, with city group [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2604.6600000000003s)]
*  in particular that was, that was kind of malodorous and, um, they were, there [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2610.5s)]
*  were people who ended up paying fines in that situation. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2617.02s)]
*  Um, but, uh, it was very critical of basically who Obama had brought [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2619.42s)]
*  in to run his economic policy. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2625.94s)]
*  And the idea was he had run as one thing and he was really another thing. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2628.26s)]
*  Um, so that was one of the first stories of that type. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2633.26s)]
*  How did the Obama administration react to the piece? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2635.58s)]
*  Um, they weren't happy. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2638.9s)]
*  Uh, if you go back and look there, there's, there's an interview with Obama. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2641.26s)]
*  They did an official Rolling Stone interview with him years later, where he, uh, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2646.14s)]
*  he sort of brought up the fact that even your magazine talked about how I didn't [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2652.06s)]
*  do enough, um, and this was like years after the fact, and by the way, I had [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2656.14s)]
*  been incredibly complimentary of him while he was running, right? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2661.58s)]
*  So of all of the things that, that had been written about him, what he [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2665.74s)]
*  remembered was this one slight, you know, which I thought was a very telling [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2669.3s)]
*  sign of his character, you know? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2673.66s)]
*  And, uh, but at the time I wasn't paying attention to the other things like about [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2675.18s)]
*  the continued prosecution of the war on terror, you know, the drone assassination [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2680.58s)]
*  thing, the kill list, you know, terror Tuesdays, all that stuff. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2685.34s)]
*  I didn't really clue into that. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2689.9s)]
*  Because killing an American citizen with a drone. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2691.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2694.3s)]
*  No, exactly. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2694.7799999999997s)]
*  That, that whole thing was incredible. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2695.58s)]
*  You know, I mean, I did a story later about another American who sued the [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2698.18s)]
*  government for, because he thought he was on the kill list, um, and you know, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2702.3399999999997s)]
*  the government's response was you're not entitled to find out whether you're on it [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2709.2999999999997s)]
*  or not, uh, you're on the kill list. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2713.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2716.3399999999997s)]
*  And the, the, the, the whole idea that we even have something called like lethal [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2717.14s)]
*  action, that it might apply to an American citizen, that you can do that without due [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2722.06s)]
*  process. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2726.94s)]
*  And, you know, if you go back and look, they, they basically invented, I mean, I [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2728.14s)]
*  don't know how disillusioning this was for you, but they just made up on the fly [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2732.82s)]
*  legal, legal justifications for what they were doing that weren't grounded in any [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2739.1s)]
*  law that was passed or any, any court case. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2744.46s)]
*  They just sort of wrote themselves white papers, giving themselves permission [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2747.18s)]
*  to do this stuff, which I think is crazy. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2751.1s)]
*  And to this day, I think it's crazy. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2753.62s)]
*  Well, I find it totally shocking. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2754.8599999999997s)]
*  And I'm, I think I'm basically opposed to the death penalty anyway, but you know, I [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2756.3799999999997s)]
*  think reasonable people can support the death penalty. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2760.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2763.3799999999997s)]
*  If there's a trial. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2763.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, that's the point, right? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2765.46s)]
*  But there's a trial and the one thing you can never do is murder your own citizens [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2766.62s)]
*  because you exist to help your citizens. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2771.9399999999996s)]
*  That's the only reason we have the government. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2773.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2774.8999999999996s)]
*  Why do we have government as a collective action on everyone's [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2775.2999999999997s)]
*  behalf, who's a citizen? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2778.46s)]
*  So the idea that you could kill an American citizen and the first time, I mean, I [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2780.8999999999996s)]
*  think I've actually killed quite a few American citizens. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2784.98s)]
*  It turns out I didn't know that, but the first time I became aware of it, it was, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2787.18s)]
*  it was a effectively a foreign national with the U S passport, the [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2791.18s)]
*  Al-Awlaki, Al-Awlaki. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2795.66s)]
*  And then, you know, supporting was like, well, is he really an American? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2797.9399999999996s)]
*  Well, yeah, actually he's an American citizen. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2800.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2802.4199999999996s)]
*  Like that's the whole point. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2802.66s)]
*  You're either a citizen or not. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2804.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2805.3799999999997s)]
*  And I remember being really shocked by that. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2806.06s)]
*  Actually, it was glossed over in this weird way. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2809.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2811.54s)]
*  People were like, yeah, he's a terrorist. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2811.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2813.74s)]
*  He's a terrorist, but. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2813.9s)]
*  Or terrorist adjacent. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2815.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2816.22s)]
*  Terrorist-y. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2816.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2817.58s)]
*  Well, I mean, you could probably call him a terrorist, but they killed [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2818.22s)]
*  a 16 year old son too. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2821.02s)]
*  Um, and, but I, so how did Obama explain that? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2823.2599999999998s)]
*  So, I mean, I remember he gave a speech. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2827.94s)]
*  I was looking at this just the other day where he, uh, he talked about, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2830.2999999999997s)]
*  uh, among other things, uh, they said that Al-Awlaki had been tied to the coal [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2834.66s)]
*  bombing and I remember reading that and thinking, okay, well, he's saying that [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2840.14s)]
*  this is punishment for a crime. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2845.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, but there's no trial, right? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2847.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh, we're pronouncing him guilty, uh, and just executing the guy for something [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2850.82s)]
*  that we say he did, uh, that seemed crazy to me, you know? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2856.38s)]
*  And I remember there was, there was another white paper. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2862.26s)]
*  Uh, I'm trying, I believe Leon Panetta was involved in it where the, the [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2864.94s)]
*  concept was yes, um, due process is required, but it doesn't have to [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2869.1000000000004s)]
*  involve the defendant, right? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2875.1400000000003s)]
*  As long as there is a process, right? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2877.94s)]
*  Uh, it can be unilaterally us just talking about it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2880.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2884.5800000000004s)]
*  And it can be post execution. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2884.7400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2886.0600000000004s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2887.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2888.0600000000004s)]
*  But that stuff's all, it's all madness. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2889.1000000000004s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2891.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'd be curious to hear what you think. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2891.78s)]
*  I mean, I think when we, when we did those things and didn't make a big stink [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2893.46s)]
*  about it psychologically, we just crossed a line into something else. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2898.9s)]
*  And, uh, I feel like there's no going back once you, once you- [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2905.06s)]
*  So we were talking about this at dinner last night. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2910.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, obviously you're coming from different polls, I guess, you know? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2911.58s)]
*  Well, it turns out not, but- [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2916.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2918.1800000000003s)]
*  In 1995, we would have been on exactly opposite sides. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2918.86s)]
*  But I think we both given our similar age had the same sort of gut level [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2923.26s)]
*  belief, which is whatever the U S does abroad is in a completely different [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2928.6600000000003s)]
*  category from the way the government conducts itself domestically. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2932.78s)]
*  In other words, you can't treat American citizens like you would, you [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2935.7400000000002s)]
*  know, the Houthis or something. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2939.26s)]
*  It's like, there's one set of standards for the way we deal, conduct [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2941.58s)]
*  reform policy with foreigners and a completely different standard for the [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2944.06s)]
*  way the U S government treats its own citizens who own the government is [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2947.42s)]
*  their government, right? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2950.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2951.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2951.7000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2951.98s)]
*  I guess what I didn't realize because I was morally deficient and young and [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2952.46s)]
*  dumb was that once you start doing really evil things abroad, you're [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2957.34s)]
*  going to do them at home actually. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2961.1800000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2962.66s)]
*  And you can't defend democracy by subverting democracy. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2963.38s)]
*  No. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2966.78s)]
*  And also you're, you're, you're basically denaturing the whole idea of [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2967.42s)]
*  democracy, you're, you're, you're diluting it. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2974.38s)]
*  Once you, once you start murdering people without due process, you know, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2977.46s)]
*  it's not democracy anymore. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2983.34s)]
*  I mean, they use that term in a very facile way now constantly. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2984.94s)]
*  Oh, we have to protect democracy. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2989.38s)]
*  Well, what do you mean by that? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2990.9s)]
*  Are you, are you going to protect democracy by censoring? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2992.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2994.98s)]
*  Like this is, this is the whole thing that I've spent the last two years on. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2995.2200000000003s)]
*  Um, if you, if, if that's what you mean, that's contradictory, right. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=2998.98s)]
*  And you know, that thing. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3004.5s)]
*  Contradictory in what sense? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3006.46s)]
*  Well, the first amendment says that we don't do that. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3008.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3011.7s)]
*  Well, like you can't protect the bill of rights by violating it. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3012.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3017.2200000000003s)]
*  And, you know, this, this whole switch, I was, I think I, like most Americans, I [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3018.02s)]
*  was like you, I, I, we all knew that America, the United States was whacking [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3025.7s)]
*  people all over the world, right. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3031.14s)]
*  I mean, even though the church committee hearings came along and we basically said [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3032.94s)]
*  we weren't going to do that anymore. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3037.1s)]
*  Of course we were doing it, right. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3038.5s)]
*  We were doing all kinds of horrible things. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3039.9s)]
*  We were probably, uh, fixing elections, you know, in half the places on earth, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3041.54s)]
*  but not here, right. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3047.7400000000002s)]
*  Like that was a, a bright line for Americans. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3049.46s)]
*  Now maybe that's chauvinistic to, to believe in that, but I was like you, I [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3052.38s)]
*  didn't think they would ever cross that line and come and bring these ideas home. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3059.46s)]
*  But, you know, this is what we're finding out now. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3065.02s)]
*  I mean, this was the big theme of the Twitter files was, you know, when we [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3067.14s)]
*  tried to figure out where, so what are the Twitter, can you explain for people who [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3072.8199999999997s)]
*  didn't follow it at the time? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3076.22s)]
*  So, uh, in late 2022, after Elon Musk acquired, um, uh, Twitter, uh, you know, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3077.5s)]
*  there started to be rumors that he was going to open up the internal [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3085.18s)]
*  communications of old Twitter and sort of give them to the world. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3089.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3093.3399999999997s)]
*  And it turned out to be true. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3094.22s)]
*  I, uh, he, I got a call one day or I got a note, um, sort of summoning me to [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3095.7799999999997s)]
*  San Francisco and from somebody at Twitter, let's put it that way. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3102.14s)]
*  And, um, and so I was the first person, uh, who was put on this project [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3106.3399999999997s)]
*  of looking rummaging through old Twitter's, you know, uh, correspondence. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3115.14s)]
*  And I, you know, I, I think he said that, uh, Elon said that his idea was that he [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3121.8199999999997s)]
*  wanted to restore trust in the platform by telling people about the different kinds [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3128.62s)]
*  of censorship techniques that were going on. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3132.18s)]
*  It's not clear exactly what, what he was up to, but, um, you know, he seems [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3135.7799999999997s)]
*  sincere at the time, uh, he brought in me. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3140.8199999999997s)]
*  He brought in Barry Weiss, Barry brought in a couple of other people [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3143.38s)]
*  like Michael Schellenberger, Lee Fong ended up being involved in other [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3146.98s)]
*  report of really good young investigative report, maybe the last one. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3151.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3155.58s)]
*  Um, you know, he, he appeared and so there was a group of us and for about [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3155.98s)]
*  three months we got to look through, um, the internal correspondence of one of [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3163.3s)]
*  the world's biggest communications companies. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3169.06s)]
*  And the big thing that we found was that there was this nexus of communication [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3171.86s)]
*  between government enforcement and intelligence agencies and the internet [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3178.1s)]
*  platforms, uh, and they had a very sophisticated organized bureaucracy that [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3182.26s)]
*  was involved with controlling content, uh, in a variety of different ways. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3188.54s)]
*  And when, when we started to try to figure out, first of all, this was [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3194.42s)]
*  shocking to us. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3197.94s)]
*  We seeing all these documents that said flagged by FBI flagged by [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3198.62s)]
*  DHS. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3203.06s)]
*  That's just because that's a crime. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3203.5s)]
*  They're committing a crime by doing that. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3205.2200000000003s)]
*  That's illegal. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3206.62s)]
*  Probably. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3207.6600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3208.34s)]
*  I mean, it's just really, it couldn't be clearer. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3208.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3210.6600000000003s)]
*  You would think, right? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3211.06s)]
*  You know, um, I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but it looked bad to me. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3212.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3215.98s)]
*  Uh, certainly it looked like a story. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3216.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3219.1800000000003s)]
*  No, no question. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3219.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3220.5s)]
*  Um, but we had to figure out where did this come from? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3221.3s)]
*  Like, how did this start? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3224.34s)]
*  And when we started asking questions, you know, it turned out that a lot of the [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3225.82s)]
*  programs that we're now targeting domestic speech began as overseas, uh, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3229.62s)]
*  counter-terrorism, uh, sort of messaging programs, right? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3236.66s)]
*  So the state department, for instance, has a, has a thing called the global [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3241.14s)]
*  engagement center, uh, which is now, um, very much interested in speech, both [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3243.94s)]
*  abroad and at home. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3251.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh, but they were once exclusively, uh, sort of counter ISIS, uh, platform. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3253.3s)]
*  In fact, they had a, they had a different name back then. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3260.02s)]
*  They were called the CSCC, but in 2016, Obama rechristened them the global [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3262.06s)]
*  engagement center and they started to look inward. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3267.98s)]
*  And when I asked people who, um, I managed to get, talk to a couple of [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3271.34s)]
*  sources who, who worked, um, at that agency, one phrase really stuck out. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3275.86s)]
*  It was CT to CP. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3281.38s)]
*  So that's counter-terrorism to counter populism. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3283.26s)]
*  And the idea was the whole mission abroad of countering ISIS or al-Qaeda. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3286.42s)]
*  Contracting wise, it was kind of drying up, right? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3294.54s)]
*  Because those threats had been somewhat neutralized. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3297.02s)]
*  Um, but populism, you know, uh, was now a very serious, it was viewed as a very [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3300.46s)]
*  serious threat, uh, after, um, occupy wall street, the tea party, the Arab [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3306.54s)]
*  spring was something that maybe they didn't see as a bad thing, but they [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3313.86s)]
*  certainly saw the transformative power of the internet platforms. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3317.5s)]
*  I think that freaked them out. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3322.86s)]
*  And the virus is communicable. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3324.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3326.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3326.9s)]
*  Then there was Brexit. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3327.5s)]
*  Then, then I think Trump was the last, you know, the last stand for a lot of these [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3328.66s)]
*  folks and they, and that's when you started to see all these communications, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3332.58s)]
*  like, you know, we have to, we need to get a more formalized, um, you know, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3335.74s)]
*  control over these platforms. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3342.62s)]
*  And so, yeah, that's when the war on terror mission turned inward. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3344.8599999999997s)]
*  And I think that's a huge story, right? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3350.58s)]
*  Uh, of, well, it's the, it's the end of the country we grew up in. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3352.8199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3355.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3356.22s)]
*  You would think, you know, and, and that's, um, you know, for me, it's been, and I [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3356.8999999999996s)]
*  think probably for, for you too, the, the, uh, this new theme of the sudden explosion [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3364.02s)]
*  of the liberal tactics and politics, um, that even if they're directed at somebody [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3372.34s)]
*  that, you know, liberals hate like Donald Trump or Steve, Steve Bannon, how can you [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3378.94s)]
*  not be freaked out by stuff like that? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3384.34s)]
*  And we haven't used contempt of Congress to jail people since the Un-American Affairs [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3386.3s)]
*  Committee in 1947, right? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3391.58s)]
*  This is like third world kind of stuff that we're seeing, uh, you know, accusing [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3394.7s)]
*  the, the front runner in a presidential campaign of a hundred different felonies. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3401.62s)]
*  Is that happening if he's not running for president? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3406.5s)]
*  I mean, who could honestly say that? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3408.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3410.1s)]
*  Um, it's, but you can't talk about it now. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3411.14s)]
*  I mean, if you, if you mention it, you're, you're out of the club and, and, and [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3414.9s)]
*  mainstream press now, which is, um, incredible to me. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3419.0600000000004s)]
*  You may have come to the obvious conclusion that the real debate is not between [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3422.46s)]
*  Republican and Democrat or socialist and capitalists, right, left. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3425.38s)]
*  The real battle is between people who are lying on purpose and people who are [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3431.6200000000003s)]
*  trying to tell you the truth. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3435.7400000000002s)]
*  It's between good and evil. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3437.78s)]
*  It's between honesty and falsehood. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3439.26s)]
*  And we hope we are on the former side. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3442.1400000000003s)]
*  That's why we created this network, the Tucker Carlson Network, and we [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3444.94s)]
*  invite you to subscribe to it. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3447.54s)]
*  Go to tuckercarlson.com slash podcast. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3449.06s)]
*  Our entire archive is there. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3452.22s)]
*  A lot of behind the scenes footage of what actually happens in this barn. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3453.46s)]
*  Uh, when only an iPhone is running tuckercarlson.com slash podcast. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3457.1s)]
*  You will not regret it. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3463.34s)]
*  So, I mean, it raises so many questions, but, uh, most obviously then if uncovering [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3464.74s)]
*  the abuse of power by the powerful and particularly by government isn't the [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3470.18s)]
*  point of journalism, it's clearly not the point of journalism anymore. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3473.46s)]
*  What is the point? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3476.94s)]
*  Well, I mean, then you become courtiers, right? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3478.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think that's again, what's ironic for me is that, you know, this is, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3481.82s)]
*  I, I saw this process happening full circle, you know, when I got first got to [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3487.78s)]
*  Russia, um, the first reporters I met had worked at places like Komsomolsk [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3492.86s)]
*  and Pravda in the eighties, right? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3498.6200000000003s)]
*  Which were at one time it was the world's largest newspaper. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3500.46s)]
*  Had a circulation of 21 million or something like that. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3503.7s)]
*  And, you know, I worked in the old Pravda building, um, when I was at the Moscow [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3506.8599999999997s)]
*  times and the people there, you know, they would tell me stories about what [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3511.94s)]
*  their jobs were in the eighties. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3514.8199999999997s)]
*  And that was like, there was like taking dictation. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3517.02s)]
*  There were clerks basically, right? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3519.8199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3521.46s)]
*  You know, they, they would get the, whatever the message of the day was and [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3521.62s)]
*  they would do it and then go home to their wives and they would go fishing on [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3526.46s)]
*  the weekends and there was no, you know, intellectual anything involved with it. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3529.42s)]
*  Um, you couldn't take it in that direction. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3533.98s)]
*  It would be hazardous to your health if you, if you did. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3535.94s)]
*  Well, that's what journalism is now in America. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3539.46s)]
*  I mean, look, what just happened with the Nord Stream thing. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3542.74s)]
*  Just take an example, right? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3545.98s)]
*  Uh, Nord Stream happens and there's no investigation whatsoever in, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3548.14s)]
*  in any of the major newspapers. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3553.42s)]
*  How can that happen? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3555.46s)]
*  It's this major consequential thing that might have an impact on, you know, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3556.74s)]
*  starting a war with a nuclear power. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3562.02s)]
*  And it just wrecked the economy of Western Europe. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3565.1s)]
*  Like, and it's a major ecological disaster, which you claim to care about. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3567.38s)]
*  It's the largest manmade emission of CO2 in history. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3571.8199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3575.7799999999997s)]
*  So, and if you think CO2 is driving the greatest threat that we face, the [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3575.98s)]
*  existential threat of climate change, then you kind of want to know how that happened. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3580.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3584.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3586.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3587.62s)]
*  You would think, you know, why wouldn't, I mean, it's, it's, it's [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3588.1s)]
*  in drive and I've spent a lot of time thinking about this because. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3591.26s)]
*  No, it was like the only person in mainstream news to point out that no Russia [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3594.7400000000002s)]
*  did not blow up Nord Stream and was attacked for it, but I was wondering, like, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3597.86s)]
*  if I'm at the New York times, like a lot of people I know, why wouldn't I just [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3601.2200000000003s)]
*  like try to report that story out? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3605.0600000000004s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3606.5400000000004s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3607.7000000000003s)]
*  Why wouldn't they? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3608.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3609.0600000000004s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3610.0600000000004s)]
*  You know, I mean, obviously you're getting a signal from down on high that, you [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3611.46s)]
*  know, that's not wanted. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3616.1400000000003s)]
*  Um, but it's different. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3618.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3620.82s)]
*  So in the, in the early two thousands, yes, there were high profile instances [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3621.1s)]
*  where people like Jesse Ventura were unhired from MSNBC because they mistakenly [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3626.14s)]
*  thought he was pro war when they hired him. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3631.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3633.46s)]
*  Um, Phil Donahue is getting good ratings, but he's bounced. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3634.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3638.06s)]
*  I was there for that. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3638.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3639.06s)]
*  Um, uh, Chris hedges, you know, um, and Chris, Chris was sort of a classic [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3639.7s)]
*  example of a phenomenon that Noam Chomsky once wrote about in manufacturing consent, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3647.1s)]
*  which is that they don't fire you necessarily, but like, you just don't get promoted [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3652.2599999999998s)]
*  if you're considered the wrong kind of personality, which is weird because good [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3656.5s)]
*  investigative reporters should be difficult personalities, right? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3660.86s)]
*  If they're not, they're probably not good reporters. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3664.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3667.5s)]
*  No, I mean, just look at who the, who are great reporters are. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3667.7s)]
*  Um, they're independent minded people, independent minded people. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3671.42s)]
*  And you know, you, you, you want to experience them in little bursts. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3675.22s)]
*  But they're all kind of crazy to be honest. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3682.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3684.78s)]
*  But that's okay. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3685.14s)]
*  Which part of the job, right? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3686.34s)]
*  But this is different. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3688.22s)]
*  Like there were a few instances like that back then where of people who are [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3689.86s)]
*  critics of the war, whatever now it's just this blanket. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3693.5s)]
*  If you step out of line on any one of two dozen different topics, you're out, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3698.3s)]
*  you know, um, and I think everybody's gotten that message and that's the only [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3703.54s)]
*  thing that makes sense to me is like, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3710.5s)]
*  so there are no brave people in all of journalism. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3712.2200000000003s)]
*  There are no honest men left. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3714.58s)]
*  Well, how can that mean that it can't be possible, but it kind of is right. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3716.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's, there are a few people who, who I think tried to do a few things, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3722.02s)]
*  you know, um, but just to take the look at the Russiagate story, they made so [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3727.58s)]
*  many mistakes on that Jeff girth. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3732.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3734.74s)]
*  Which before you, I want, let's put you at the center of this. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3734.98s)]
*  Cause you were one of the reasons we're having this conversation is you were one [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3737.8599999999997s)]
*  of the only liberals in all media who's and you speak Russian, you live there [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3741.46s)]
*  for 10 years, like you have credibility on this question, I would say, and you [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3747.58s)]
*  were the only ones who said, you know, I don't like Trump, I didn't vote for [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3751.62s)]
*  Trump, but like, I don't think this is real. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3754.98s)]
*  I had a book out at the time called insane clown president about Donald Trump. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3757.3799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3761.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a fan of the guy, right. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3762.5s)]
*  But they came to me. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3765.6200000000003s)]
*  So where were you when the Russiagate thing started? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3766.46s)]
*  I was at rolling stone and what did you think when you first [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3768.98s)]
*  heard that he was a Russian agent? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3772.0600000000004s)]
*  So, uh, it was in late 2016 is right after he had gotten elected. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3773.9s)]
*  He remember that list that came out proper, not, um, well, the Washington [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3781.0600000000004s)]
*  posted this story about this weird blacklist that, uh, they had discovered [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3785.94s)]
*  of people who the Russians were supposedly in league with, and it was [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3790.02s)]
*  this shadowy organization called proper, not, and they linked to this list of. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3794.2599999999998s)]
*  Um, sites and, you know, without any evidence at all, they were, they were [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3799.98s)]
*  linking all kinds of independent journalists to, to Russia and I thought, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3806.18s)]
*  well, that's crazy. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3811.38s)]
*  And then, then there was this whole thing about, um, I actually had to do a segment. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3812.46s)]
*  Um, on MSNBC, uh, with Chris Hayes, the other guest was Malcolm Nance of all people. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3819.18s)]
*  And it was all about, you know, is, is Trump in league before he got [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3826.1s)]
*  inaugurated, is Trump, um, uh, you know, in league with the Russians? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3831.42s)]
*  Uh, there had been just been a big leak about that. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3836.06s)]
*  And I thought, well, there's no evidence for this, right? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3838.94s)]
*  Like we, we just had a catastrophic episode in journalism with the WMD [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3841.54s)]
*  thing, where anonymous sources get us in a lot of trouble. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3845.98s)]
*  Um, if you can't recreate the experiment in the lab, you got to be careful of that [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3850.5s)]
*  story, right? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3855.26s)]
*  And that's all I said. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3856.86s)]
*  I wasn't like, he's innocent, you know, like I just thought. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3857.94s)]
*  This is a dangerous story. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3861.82s)]
*  Let's all be careful with this. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3863.22s)]
*  And immediately there was this reaction that was just shocking to me. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3865.38s)]
*  It was, it was like this shunning thing. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3870.78s)]
*  It happened to me. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3872.38s)]
*  It happened to, you know, Greenwald, obviously, uh, Aaron Maté at the nation. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3873.74s)]
*  There was like a group letter that was written by the rest of the staff. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3878.66s)]
*  Um, you know, denouncing him, uh, the, you know, the husband of the editor of the, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3882.4599999999996s)]
*  of the nation also, the Stephen Cohen, they didn't want him around. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3888.2599999999998s)]
*  Um, wonderful man. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3892.58s)]
*  He was. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3894.18s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3894.66s)]
*  He was a good friend of mine. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3895.2999999999997s)]
*  Um, but it was crazy because this was so early in the process and [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3896.7s)]
*  everybody had already predetermined that that's not this thing was true. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3903.38s)]
*  This extraordinary complicated thesis. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3907.2200000000003s)]
*  Um, they had somehow already arrived at the conclusion that it was proven. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3910.46s)]
*  And at this point you didn't know either way. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3914.94s)]
*  I didn't really know either way, but I had a strong suspicion that it was wrong. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3918.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3921.54s)]
*  Like this, you know, journalists have a sense or the sixth sense. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3921.9s)]
*  This doesn't smell right. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3926.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3927.34s)]
*  Like it's kind of like the French connection where, where, um, you know, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3927.7000000000003s)]
*  Gene Hackman looks over and he says, that's a wrong table. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3931.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3934.14s)]
*  Like this was a wrong table. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3934.42s)]
*  It didn't look right. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3936.2599999999998s)]
*  And I felt the same way. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3937.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3938.46s)]
*  And it was too complicated for me to see. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3938.7799999999997s)]
*  I wish I had known at the time. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3941.54s)]
*  In right wing world where I then worked and lived, I felt like everyone believed it. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3944.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3949.74s)]
*  But how, how is that possible? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3950.62s)]
*  Well, I remember saying to somebody, you know, I think this is, I think this could [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3952.1s)]
*  be like complete bullshit, like actual bullshit. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3956.38s)]
*  And my friend goes, be careful. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3958.46s)]
*  Be careful. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3959.98s)]
*  Think there's something there. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3961.14s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3961.9799999999996s)]
*  I'm by the way, I'm, I try to be very open-minded. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3962.9399999999996s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3965.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3966.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3966.3799999999997s)]
*  If you're actually a space alien, I don't know, prove it to me. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3966.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3968.66s)]
*  I just, I really try to keep every possibility open, but I kept asking people [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3968.8999999999996s)]
*  like, what, okay, how do we know this? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3974.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3977.2599999999998s)]
*  Everybody believed it. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3977.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3979.7799999999997s)]
*  Why? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3980.3799999999997s)]
*  I, you know, they hated Trump. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3982.14s)]
*  That was obvious, you know? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3983.8199999999997s)]
*  Um, but that wasn't enough for me. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3986.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3989.02s)]
*  Like just on a superficial level, it didn't fit Donald Trump. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3989.38s)]
*  You want to tell me he's involved in some mob deal, uh, to build a, a [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3994.06s)]
*  casino in Atlantic city or something like that, right? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=3999.5s)]
*  Like I believe that Donald Trump being James Bond and involved in a five year [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4002.42s)]
*  conspiracy with, uh, the Russian government, uh, you know, what, what did [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4008.62s)]
*  Seale call it, a well-developed conspiracy of five years, that's ridiculous. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4013.98s)]
*  This is a guy who, if you've been to any of his campaign speeches, he can't get [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4019.06s)]
*  through the first sentence of one of his scripts, like his brain is already [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4023.5s)]
*  off in another direction. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4026.9s)]
*  How is that guy going to keep a secret? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4028.46s)]
*  Um, it didn't make any sense and. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4030.66s)]
*  No, nobody had any evidence. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4033.86s)]
*  Um, and then even when things came out, that should have been fatal to the story. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4035.7s)]
*  Like when it finally came out in October of 2017, that the Clinton campaign had [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4041.38s)]
*  funded the steel dossier, um, I thought, well that it's over now, right? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4046.26s)]
*  It's a Republican donor too. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4052.5s)]
*  Well, yes. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4054.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4055.82s)]
*  Sort of previously, right? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4056.46s)]
*  See the steel, um, didn't come on until, until later, but still once that came out [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4057.5800000000004s)]
*  and, you know, you knew that campaign research had ended up in an intelligence [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4064.2200000000003s)]
*  assessment, um, that should have been it. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4069.86s)]
*  I thought, and everybody just plowed ahead. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4073.14s)]
*  Like it was still a thing. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4075.98s)]
*  And so what happened to you in the middle of all? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4077.62s)]
*  So you're at Rolling Stone. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4080.02s)]
*  You're this famous liberal reporter, one of the most famous liberal reporters [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4081.18s)]
*  actually, and you make the mistake of saying, well, we don't know for a fact [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4084.94s)]
*  this is true, people start shunning you. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4089.94s)]
*  Where does it go from there? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4091.66s)]
*  So then I started to get angry about it. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4094.06s)]
*  And, um, and at one point I went, oh, because, uh, you know, I don't like to be [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4096.1s)]
*  told what to do. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4102.74s)]
*  I don't like to be told that I got to ignore something, right? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4103.5s)]
*  Um, you know, like I'm one of those difficult personalities in journalism, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4106.82s)]
*  right? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4111.179999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, it just happens that way. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4111.38s)]
*  But I went to Rolling Stone at one point. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4113.5s)]
*  Um, I had really good editors there for the most part, but I went to them and I, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4115.82s)]
*  and I said, um, look, this story is wrong, right? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4120.42s)]
*  And it's going to come out that it's wrong. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4124.94s)]
*  Give me eight weeks to chase this down and let's, let's be the first mainstream [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4128.26s)]
*  organization to get it right and, and put it to bed and it'll be a coup for us. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4133.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4139.139999999999s)]
*  You know, let me, let me do my thing on this. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4139.58s)]
*  And they said no, the first time they ever said no to me, um, you know, like a, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4142.139999999999s)]
*  an investigative project. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4147.099999999999s)]
*  Just to restate, you speak Russian, you can read Russian. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4148.22s)]
*  So there's like probably no one better to do the story. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4151.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4154.42s)]
*  I would think, right? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4155.139999999999s)]
*  You know, I even had some sources over there, right? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4156.3s)]
*  Who could have chased it down, you know, certain aspects of it down, like, you [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4158.860000000001s)]
*  know, the Trump tower deal and all that stuff, like that would have been relatively [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4163.06s)]
*  easy to, to go through and I, and I had covered Congress. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4167.14s)]
*  So the people who were investigating this, like I, I, I knew some of those folks too. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4170.7s)]
*  Um, and it's a, it's a great story. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4176.38s)]
*  I mean, when it first came out, it was obvious this is either the biggest [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4179.3s)]
*  intelligence, uh, coup in history, right? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4183.38s)]
*  The Russians getting a Manchurian candidate in the white house, or it's the [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4186.66s)]
*  biggest fake in history, right? [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4191.46s)]
*  The biggest setup in history. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4193.78s)]
*  Somebody's either telling the biggest whopper ever, or, or the Russians have [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4195.5s)]
*  just pulled off this, the most amazing thing they can't, there's no other option. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4199.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4203.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4203.54s)]
*  So if it's not this, it's that, and we might as well be the first to report that. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4204.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4210.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4210.9800000000005s)]
*  And so what did they say when you make? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4211.58s)]
*  They said, no, I don't even, I mean, I don't even remember what the excuse was. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4213.22s)]
*  I th they just weren't enthused about the idea, you know? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4218.54s)]
*  And, um, and I understood that, you know, like the look, they're a Rolling [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4221.38s)]
*  Stone, they have a, they have an audience that has certain expectations, but. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4226.14s)]
*  That was a, that was a big moment for me. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4231.66s)]
*  You know, I mean, I was naive. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4233.62s)]
*  I actually thought they, you know, that the, the magazine would be [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4235.62s)]
*  interested in, in going there because they had let me, you know, go against [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4240.9s)]
*  Obama before they let me do other things, but not on this. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4245.62s)]
*  So, um, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4248.5s)]
*  so how, what did your colleagues say to you? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4250.82s)]
*  Cause by this point, I think it was becoming public to anyone who was watching [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4252.74s)]
*  like me, that you were dissenting from the line on this question. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4257.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4261.82s)]
*  So I would say Glenn Greenwald took the brunt of it. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4262.0199999999995s)]
*  Um, you know, there were stories in the, the New Yorker profiles, you know, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4266.219999999999s)]
*  the bane of their resistance, right? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4272.099999999999s)]
*  Like why is Glenn Greenwald being a stick in the mud about this Russia thing? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4273.98s)]
*  Uh, that was like a feature topic in ma in, in magazines, like a bunch of them. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4277.78s)]
*  And, you know, w and they, they concluded by the way that he was motivated by, by [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4283.179999999999s)]
*  his impatience with the rise of women and minorities in the democratic party. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4290.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4299.0599999999995s)]
*  I was a racist. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4300.18s)]
*  I actually had the physical copy of the New Yorker when they came out. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4302.099999999999s)]
*  They did. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4305.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4306.38s)]
*  And it was, it was an on the record quote by one of his former editors of all things. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4306.74s)]
*  Um, the Glenn's a racist. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4311.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4312.98s)]
*  Well, they didn't. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4313.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4314.46s)]
*  Well, he's impatient with the rise of women and minorities. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4314.74s)]
*  So when I saw that, I'm like, wow, this is like, what is going on with this? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4317.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4323.179999999999s)]
*  And meanwhile, you know, I was getting it from all angles. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4323.42s)]
*  There were former Russian, former American diplomats who were going after me online [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4327.139999999999s)]
*  saying I was in league with Putin and you know, seriously. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4333.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4336.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4337.0599999999995s)]
*  It's kind of a heavy charge. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4337.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4339.259999999999s)]
*  You would think, you know, um, and that was becoming increasingly common. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4340.099999999999s)]
*  It was an implication of a lot of the, the back and forth, uh, on social media. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4346.02s)]
*  Um, you know, this person is too close to Russia or, you know, he loves Putin. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4352.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4358.14s)]
*  Like that, that kind of a thing. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4358.46s)]
*  Had you ever worked as a secret agent for Putin? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4360.26s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4362.660000000001s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4363.46s)]
*  I am kidding. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4365.46s)]
*  Actually, I'm so nuts. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4366.42s)]
*  You just said you left Russia because you didn't like the vibe under Putin. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4367.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, we, we both, we both, we both, we both, we both, we both, we both, we [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4371.18s)]
*  put Putin in the cover of our newspaper, like in drag carrying a dominatrix whip. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4375.98s)]
*  You know, like we, we lampooned him constantly. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4381.7s)]
*  And, um, and I actually, I did some journalism in Russian for another paper [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4385.58s)]
*  that was very critical of him and talked about the apartment bombings and some other stuff. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4391.66s)]
*  And, um, so I was no friend of Vladimir Putin's, but that became a common thing [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4395.9s)]
*  in journalism and it's, it was just so shocking. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4402.139999999999s)]
*  And I, I knew at that point that my time was limited at, you know, at [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4405.7s)]
*  Rolling Stone, which I loved the place. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4410.82s)]
*  I really loved that place. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4412.3s)]
*  It was, and it's a great gig too. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4414.0199999999995s)]
*  Um, but there was no way I was going to be able to stay under those circumstances. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4416.0199999999995s)]
*  How long did you last? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4421.46s)]
*  Until, um, 2020, I guess. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4423.38s)]
*  So 15 years, roughly. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4426.42s)]
*  Um, you know, maybe, maybe 16, I guess. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4428.38s)]
*  Um, so it was, it was a great time. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4432.62s)]
*  So when it became clear that, you know, the claim that Putin had installed [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4435.78s)]
*  Trump is the American president, when it became clear that was like malicious [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4441.62s)]
*  fantasy, it was a total lie. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4445.9400000000005s)]
*  Did any of the people who attacked you and called you a Russian agent [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4448.06s)]
*  apologize or change their mind? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4451.54s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4453.9800000000005s)]
*  Did they even apologize to you? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4454.58s)]
*  No, but it's a little different. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4457.78s)]
*  It's by that point, I was like such an outlaw that like, I had no [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4458.82s)]
*  expectation of being treated fairly by anyone ever other than my wife. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4461.42s)]
*  So I, I was just, no, I'm serious by that. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4464.54s)]
*  You know, I was just like your head changes, but you were very much at. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4467.02s)]
*  Like everyone liked you. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4470.9800000000005s)]
*  And I mean, you were not an outlaw. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4472.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4475.46s)]
*  And then, but you became an outlaw kind of overnight. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4475.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4477.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4478.38s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4478.82s)]
*  My name is sort of, uh, you know, synonymous with, uh, you know, reactionary [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4481.02s)]
*  troll that, you know, that kind of thing. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4489.58s)]
*  Um, and that happened basically overnight. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4492.22s)]
*  It was a little tough to take for a few years there, but, um, but, you know, I [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4495.86s)]
*  got over it relatively quickly. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4501.34s)]
*  I moved to Substack, which was, um, it turned out to be a great thing. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4503.26s)]
*  Uh, and which is an independent platform. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4508.1s)]
*  And, uh, you know, I was one of the first people who, um, kind of left big [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4512.86s)]
*  mainstream media to do the self publishing thing and, and, uh, discovered [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4518.82s)]
*  that there was actually, you know, um, a functioning business model there. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4525.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, um, I had been in journalism for 30 years and had never seen it as [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4530.58s)]
*  anything but a dying business. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4535.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4537.259999999999s)]
*  There was never any money that you were actually going to make. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4537.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4539.82s)]
*  If you're making a hundred grand, you're like psyched. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4540.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4542.0599999999995s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it turns out that there's actually this huge market [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4542.94s)]
*  out there because people hate journalism. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4545.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4548.179999999999s)]
*  Like that's the problem when you're in mainstream media, you don't see that [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4548.42s)]
*  there's actually this screaming need for something else, uh, that people aren't [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4552.86s)]
*  getting because they don't trust regular media. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4556.9800000000005s)]
*  So I was, I was an early beneficiary of that whole thing. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4560.9s)]
*  And it was a default though. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4564.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, you probably would have stayed at New Yorker or Rolling, or where [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4566.06s)]
*  you were Rolling Stone forever. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4570.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4572.9400000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4573.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4574.1s)]
*  Had this not happened, I would have been there, you know, I was very loyal to [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4574.38s)]
*  the magazine, you know, I stuck up for them always, even when they were wrong, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4577.98s)]
*  even during the UVA thing, you know, I said, look, they made a mistake, but [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4581.219999999999s)]
*  we're, we're doing the right thing. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4586.259999999999s)]
*  We're auditing, we're self auditing. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4587.54s)]
*  Like, you know, this is a great magazine. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4589.339999999999s)]
*  We have a great history, tradition, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4591.66s)]
*  I mean, I was kind of a company man in an embarrassing kind of way. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4595.139999999999s)]
*  Um, but when the, the Russia thing happened, you know, all bets were off and [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4598.78s)]
*  I wasn't the only one there were, there were, you know, there were other people [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4604.86s)]
*  in the business this, this also happened to. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4607.74s)]
*  So, um, but none of them came back the way that you did. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4609.94s)]
*  Oh, I mean, Glenn did. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4615.179999999999s)]
*  Well, Glenn, sure. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4616.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4617.7s)]
*  No. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4618.46s)]
*  Um, well, very few. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4619.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4620.7s)]
*  A few. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4621.139999999999s)]
*  Did you think about just hanging it up and becoming a translator or doing something [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4622.259999999999s)]
*  else? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4625.7s)]
*  No, I mean, I love this job. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4626.94s)]
*  You know, I, I, I, after initially not really loving, uh, journalism, I learned [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4628.58s)]
*  to really love it while I was out, while it was at Rolling Stone, you know? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4636.82s)]
*  And, um, and then, you know, now, um, additionally, I think the country needs [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4640.9s)]
*  journalists and they're the thing that, that you need most of all in journalism [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4649.22s)]
*  to be good at it is you need to be, you need to have some bravery. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4654.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4657.7s)]
*  That wasn't true in American journalism for a long time. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4657.86s)]
*  Um, probably, you know, not, not since the Vietnam days or, or the red scare, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4661.5s)]
*  you know, was there a situation where there was a real social price to pay for, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4667.54s)]
*  for taking, you know, a certain stance on things. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4671.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, now there is, right. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4675.86s)]
*  And if you're going to do certain kinds of reporting, um, you're going to lose [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4678.1s)]
*  all your friends, but that's the job, you know, and not many people are willing [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4682.54s)]
*  to do that and I am willing to do that because, because I never expected to keep [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4686.22s)]
*  friends in this business. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4691.58s)]
*  So, um, I think it's an, it's unfortunately an exciting time to be a journalist, but, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4692.58s)]
*  um, you know, I would feel wrong to quit now, you know, I'm sure you'd [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4700.3s)]
*  probably feel the same way. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4705.1s)]
*  I do feel the same way. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4705.9400000000005s)]
*  That's exactly how I feel. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4706.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4707.54s)]
*  Nicely put. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4707.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you don't. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4708.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4709.14s)]
*  If you're in it to make friends, you're probably, you know, probably [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4709.740000000001s)]
*  in the wrong business, go to church. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4711.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4713.02s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4713.34s)]
*  But, um, tell us about like having been in institutional journalism, you know, at [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4714.38s)]
*  the top of it really, and then finding yourself like having to work for yourself. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4720.34s)]
*  Like what are the advantages and disadvantages? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4726.900000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, being in institutional journalism, there is a little bit overrated, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4729.7s)]
*  right? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4735.78s)]
*  Like I think, um, cause I came from alternative journalism. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4736.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4740.62s)]
*  I, I had financed my, my own newspaper in Moscow. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4740.82s)]
*  Um, and, uh, you know, I did everything from printing to running the plates to, to [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4746.099999999999s)]
*  the printing press and, um, you know, selling ads, everything. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4753.34s)]
*  So, uh, you know, the, the business is, uh, is something that I've always been [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4757.54s)]
*  familiar with and suddenly being involved with a big organization. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4763.219999999999s)]
*  It's nice, but I don't see it as a prerequisite. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4766.259999999999s)]
*  I thought it was really funny at the beginning of Trump's reign when a couple of [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4769.86s)]
*  the reporters were complaining about losing their White House press credentials. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4773.82s)]
*  It's like, who cares, right? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4778.42s)]
*  You're out, you're supposed to be on the outside. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4780.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4781.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4782.38s)]
*  Like, what are you whining about? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4783.14s)]
*  You know, do the job. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4784.66s)]
*  Um, you've been to a White House briefing. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4786.42s)]
*  I have. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4788.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4788.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4789.02s)]
*  You know how soul killing it is. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4789.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4791.18s)]
*  You learn nothing. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4791.46s)]
*  You're captive. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4792.3s)]
*  You eat lunch out of a vending machine. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4793.74s)]
*  Everybody has got like the most distorted value system. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4796.38s)]
*  Like they're so impressed by their hard passes and they're all such a losers. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4799.74s)]
*  Like if you would, uh, you would quit the business, right? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4803.46s)]
*  If you had to do that. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4806.219999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4806.98s)]
*  In fact, one of the first things that I was assigned to do when I went to [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4807.7s)]
*  Rolling Stone, they sent me on a campaign junket with John Kerry. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4812.0199999999995s)]
*  So I was on the plane with Kerry during that campaign for like a month or [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4817.179999999999s)]
*  something like that, and you know, it's a similar dynamic to the [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4821.78s)]
*  White House press corps. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4825.62s)]
*  It's the same people every single day. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4826.82s)]
*  Um, it's very clubby. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4830.42s)]
*  They have extremely, right? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4832.82s)]
*  So the there's even seating arrangements, right? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4834.7s)]
*  That's the worst the New York times gets to sit in the front. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4837.14s)]
*  And then they, they kind of, it's almost, it's like heathers or mean girls. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4840.54s)]
*  You, they, you know, according to how, how well known you are in the business, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4843.74s)]
*  you have to sit further and further back in the plane, right? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4848.22s)]
*  Or farther back in the plane. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4850.9s)]
*  Um, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4852.74s)]
*  and at the very back or the cameraman. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4853.3s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4854.98s)]
*  And, and they, at the time they were angry at Alexander Pelosi because [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4855.9s)]
*  she had filmed some of them. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4860.0599999999995s)]
*  So she was in the back with a bunch of count, a bunch of piles of equipment. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4861.34s)]
*  But, um, but I got frustrated very quickly by the fact that all they were [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4864.98s)]
*  doing all day long was just taking, um, you know, press releases from flax, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4870.42s)]
*  and then they would eat, they would, they would be given these macaroni and [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4876.98s)]
*  cheese, butterfingers. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4880.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4881.86s)]
*  So I went on a hunger strike. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4882.719999999999s)]
*  Uh, in my first trip, I had this like epiphany that they're just giving me too [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4884.32s)]
*  much stuff. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4890.639999999999s)]
*  I'm just not going to take anything from any of these people. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4891.16s)]
*  And I stopped eating. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4893.28s)]
*  I stopped taking the press releases. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4894.799999999999s)]
*  Um, the only one who didn't get fat on a campaign. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4896.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4899.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4900.2s)]
*  Um, and, and when we got to the events, I would not go to the events. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4900.599999999999s)]
*  I would run a mile in any direction and just talk to anybody about anything [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4905.24s)]
*  about the campaign. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4908.84s)]
*  Um, because the, like, this isn't journalism. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4910.04s)]
*  You're sitting there just being, just taking something and then converting [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4915.320000000001s)]
*  it into a press release. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4919.16s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4920.52s)]
*  You know, but the white house is even worse because they have, they have [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4921.4800000000005s)]
*  heirs about it. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4926.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4927.64s)]
*  Um, and, you know, even though I haven't done that beat, you know, uh, for, I [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4927.96s)]
*  think it's an important beat. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4934.52s)]
*  Like you have to, somebody has to ask the president questions, but they don't [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4935.8s)]
*  for the most part, right? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4939.84s)]
*  I know. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4940.8s)]
*  Do they? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4941.04s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4941.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4942.68s)]
*  So, you know, I don't know. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4943.12s)]
*  At best you get some reporter whose goal is not to elicit information, but just to [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4945.52s)]
*  prove that he's like an antagonist of the president. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4950.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4954.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4955.28s)]
*  I'm, I'm, you know, thanks Dan rather, but it doesn't advance the [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4955.72s)]
*  story in any meaningful way. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4959.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4961.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4962.400000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4962.84s)]
*  What they want is, and that's what they were, they were upset about the [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4963.24s)]
*  Jim Acosta's of the world. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4966.28s)]
*  They were upset that they were being denied this, this, um, you know, saleable [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4967.4s)]
*  piece of video where they could stand up and do this, you know, and, and just [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4973.4s)]
*  circulate and, um, I always wondered what Jim Acosta, who I don't know, but I [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4978.5599999999995s)]
*  always wondered, Jim Acosta was always telling me what a journalist he was. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4984.16s)]
*  And a lot of guys were like this. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4987.2s)]
*  Um, including some I've worked with, but I'm a [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4989.12s)]
*  journalist, okay. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4993.0s)]
*  Tornado comes to trailer park. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4994.8s)]
*  Give me 750 words on that. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4996.52s)]
*  Like, I don't think they're capable of writing a story. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=4998.32s)]
*  Do you ever think that like, could Jim Acosta actually just write like a [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5000.56s)]
*  news story or even an expository essay? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5003.4s)]
*  Well, I wonder about that because are they even, you know, once not that long [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5005.96s)]
*  and not to be all back in the day about it, but you wouldn't have gotten a job [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5011.44s)]
*  in the white house press course. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5015.92s)]
*  You hadn't come through, you know, covering town meetings and all that stuff. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5017.12s)]
*  I mean, you know, I did that. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5022.16s)]
*  I covered, I covered alderman. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5024.5599999999995s)]
*  I covered, you know, the police beat fires, stuff like that. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5026.5599999999995s)]
*  You have to be able to do that stuff. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5031.16s)]
*  And that's the basics of the job is, you know, showing up, talking to people on [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5032.88s)]
*  the street, talking to this person, that person, you have to be able to do crime [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5039.4s)]
*  reporting, you know, um, and you got to talk to people who are on the other [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5042.44s)]
*  side of the law, all that stuff. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5047.8s)]
*  I don't think they can do that. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5049.36s)]
*  I mean, I remember seeing somebody, I forget what organization it was, but [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5050.759999999999s)]
*  somebody, one of the kind of mainstream sort of web only sites, one of their [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5055.16s)]
*  columnist was talking about how much he hated the telephone and I thought what [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5063.0s)]
*  journalists hates the telephone. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5068.16s)]
*  How can you do this job if you hate the telephone, right? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5069.679999999999s)]
*  If you, and it's because the new thing is they decide what they think. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5072.24s)]
*  They find links that support their ideas and then they just type the thing. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5077.4s)]
*  Whereas, you know, what you're supposed to do is talk to everybody, then figure [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5083.32s)]
*  out what the story is to add information to the story, right? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5087.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5090.08s)]
*  Not just, you know, the snake eating its tail. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5090.44s)]
*  It's ba it's just all self-reference actually. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5093.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5095.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5095.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5096.639999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5097.639999999999s)]
*  So you get out of that. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5098.72s)]
*  You go, so the business model works in independent media? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5100.2s)]
*  Well, kinda right. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5103.599999999999s)]
*  So it works if you're, if you're cranking out content. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5105.48s)]
*  Um, the, what I don't think it's, they figured out how to do is how to monetize [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5109.08s)]
*  like investigative journalism, which takes a long time. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5114.44s)]
*  It's expensive. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5117.92s)]
*  It's expensive. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5118.599999999999s)]
*  And you don't, you're not producing stuff that's, you know, every couple of days. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5119.5199999999995s)]
*  And even when you do, it's not always the stuff that people like. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5124.96s)]
*  People like reading, you know, op-eds that with strong takes that you can make [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5129.36s)]
*  money doing that. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5135.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5135.92s)]
*  Also you whiff sometimes. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5136.44s)]
*  I mean, a lot of stories don't, it happens to me even now a lot. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5137.92s)]
*  You can waste a lot of time on stuff that's not real or not provable. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5141.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5145.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5146.2s)]
*  Or you think that people are going to go bananas over something and they don't. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5146.72s)]
*  There's that. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5150.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5150.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5151.12s)]
*  What stories have you had that you thought would make a splash have an effect, but [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5151.639999999999s)]
*  that were instantly forgotten? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5156.84s)]
*  Well, I don't know if forgotten, but I would say that a lot of the Twitter [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5160.2s)]
*  file stuff, I expected that to be, I mean, I naively expected a lot of that stuff to [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5164.04s)]
*  be picked up. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5171.12s)]
*  Give us an example of what shocked you that you discovered during that reporting. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5171.6s)]
*  So one of the things was that Twitter heading into the 2020 election had worked [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5176.28s)]
*  out a system with the FBI and the department of Homeland security and the office of the [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5185.16s)]
*  director of national intelligence, whereby they had what they called an industry meeting [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5191.12s)]
*  where once it started off once a month, then it was once a week where these intelligence [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5197.44s)]
*  officials were meeting with Twitter and about two dozen other internet platforms and [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5203.12s)]
*  briefing them on things that they might expect in the information landscape. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5208.6s)]
*  And then there was a system by which basically Twitter was receiving recommendations [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5213.48s)]
*  about content from the federal government, through the FBI, and then from the states [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5224.04s)]
*  through the department of Homeland security. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5229.28s)]
*  It was, it was that organized. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5231.2s)]
*  They like, they had worked it out that like, if it comes from, you know, a local police [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5232.6s)]
*  department, it's going to come from the DHS. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5236.64s)]
*  If it comes from the HHS, it's going to come through the FBI. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5238.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5241.44s)]
*  Like, so they had a very organized system of flags that, where you would see the FBI [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5241.76s)]
*  say, you know, for your consideration, here are some accounts that may violate your terms [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5250.6s)]
*  of service and there'd be an attached spreadsheet with, you know, 400 account names on it. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5257.72s)]
*  And that was just happening constantly. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5263.2s)]
*  It was an industrial process that they had worked out. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5266.16s)]
*  I thought that's a huge story, right? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5269.679999999999s)]
*  Like this, here's the FBI that's devoting resources to looking at social media accounts [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5272.48s)]
*  of ordinary people and worrying about terms of service violations. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5278.639999999999s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5282.5199999999995s)]
*  Why are they not looking for child predators? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5283.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5286.5199999999995s)]
*  And so what was that? [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5288.08s)]
*  Well, it's, it's part of this sort of spiraling, sprawling thing where a whole series of [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5289.92s)]
*  government agencies are very intensely interested in what's online and who's reading [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5297.56s)]
*  what and, and then developing new ways of, you know, suppressing content, deamplifying [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5302.04s)]
*  other things. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5308.8s)]
*  And with COVID, there was a really, really intense effort to, to create rules about what [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5309.280000000001s)]
*  could and could not be seen. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5317.04s)]
*  What would, you know, they were, they would decide that things were, one of the key concepts [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5318.4400000000005s)]
*  that I thought was really, really disturbing was this whole idea that anything that promotes [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5325.96s)]
*  vaccine hesitancy is a kind of disinformation, even if it's not factually incorrect. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5332.4800000000005s)]
*  So if somebody dies after they get the shot, right, that may be true. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5339.68s)]
*  But internally at the company, they're... [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5347.0s)]
*  But knowing that might convince other people not to take the shot. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5351.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5354.36s)]
*  And so they looked at that as a kind of disinformation, even though it's true. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5355.2s)]
*  One of the... [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5362.0s)]
*  Disinformation doesn't mean untrue, correct? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5362.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5365.44s)]
*  It carries the connotation, like the definition involves falsity, right? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5366.08s)]
*  Or misinformation even, right? [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5373.12s)]
*  So disinformation is like the intentional spreading of lies, right? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5374.88s)]
*  But even misinformation, Home and Security has something they called the MDM or they [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5379.6s)]
*  had the MDM committee, which is Misinformation, Disinformation and Malinformation Committee. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5385.92s)]
*  And malinformation is, it's just material, it's true, but kind of politically wrong, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5392.4800000000005s)]
*  right? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5399.68s)]
*  Or inconvenient. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5400.88s)]
*  And that could be something that promotes vaccine hesitancy or, you know, we have the [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5402.4800000000005s)]
*  Supreme Court case now in Mississippi and Missouri that's partly related to the Twitter [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5407.84s)]
*  files and the plaintiffs and a couple of the three of the plaintiffs in that case are doctors [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5413.04s)]
*  who were, who had published true research about COVID, but were suppressed, were de-amplified. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5419.84s)]
*  They were put on, you know, in Twitter, they were put on trends blacklists because, you know, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5426.72s)]
*  their research tended to go against federal policies about lockdowns and vaccination and [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5434.0s)]
*  all kinds of things. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5441.2s)]
*  So to me, that's what the First Amendment is there for, right? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5442.56s)]
*  Like we do not want the government in a role of deciding what's true and untrue because [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5447.4400000000005s)]
*  once you do that, the government has monopoly on misinformation. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5452.4s)]
*  The only protection against that happening is absolutely unfettered free speech. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5456.4800000000005s)]
*  And they're messing with that, you know, because I think there's just this gradual moving away [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5462.96s)]
*  from belief that all the concepts in the Bill of Rights work. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5472.0s)]
*  And so this, but we, what we looked at in terms of the censorship, it's very much in evidence [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5476.0s)]
*  there where they just don't believe that the First Amendment works, I don't think. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5483.12s)]
*  But they're the government, they exist to protect the First Amendment. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5487.28s)]
*  That's the whole point of having a government, right? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5490.8s)]
*  So again, that seems like a prima facie crime to me. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5493.76s)]
*  And as you said, at very least a huge story. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5498.8s)]
*  What happened to that story once you reported it? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5501.68s)]
*  I was denounced as a right-wing tool, right? [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5503.68s)]
*  The Washington Post, their first story about the Twitter, about the Twitter files [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5509.52s)]
*  described me as conservative journalist, Matt Taithi. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5513.2s)]
*  And then they did a silent... [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5518.16s)]
*  I would beg to differ. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5520.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5521.36s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5523.6s)]
*  And then, and you know, that was the line all the way through, even though the reports really, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5524.56s)]
*  they weren't really about suppression of one political party or another, they were really [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5532.16s)]
*  much more about this process, which is just so scary, right? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5536.8s)]
*  And nobody, nobody in the regular press really picked it up. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5540.24s)]
*  And that was a shocker to me because I thought, well, somebody's got to be interested in this. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5545.28s)]
*  And they weren't. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5550.4s)]
*  How long were you there? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5552.08s)]
*  At Twitter doing the story, three and a half months, I would say. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5554.56s)]
*  So we got a lot of stuff. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5560.48s)]
*  We got, I mean, not a lot, 200,000 emails, something like that, attachments. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5561.52s)]
*  We still haven't gone through all of it. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5567.28s)]
*  But the big thing was that there's just lots of evidence of this interplay between government [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5569.84s)]
*  and these platforms. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5576.96s)]
*  I think Elon at one point said publicly that there were Intel operatives working at Google, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5579.12s)]
*  at Twitter rather. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5585.04s)]
*  Lots of them. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5586.08s)]
*  Working there. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5586.96s)]
*  Lots of them. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5587.84s)]
*  And that was another thing we didn't understand. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5588.8s)]
*  You know, when we first got there, we're like, why is there a CIA person here? [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5591.36s)]
*  Why is this person a former national security counsel operative? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5596.8s)]
*  Like, what value do they bring to... [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5602.0s)]
*  A tech company. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5604.4s)]
*  A tech company. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5605.28s)]
*  I couldn't understand that. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5606.0s)]
*  But they're actually working there as employees. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5607.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5609.2s)]
*  And they were making a lot of the big decisions about content, too. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5609.759999999999s)]
*  In fact, one of the biggest emails that we found, there was a debate about whether or not [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5614.719999999999s)]
*  Twitter had the ability to say no to... [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5620.88s)]
*  In this case, it was a State Department request about content. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5624.08s)]
*  And the former CIA employee says, you know, our window on that is closing [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5627.759999999999s)]
*  as our government partners become more aggressive in their attributions. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5633.6s)]
*  Right? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5638.88s)]
*  So what they were basically saying is, our ability to push back is evaporating. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5639.120000000001s)]
*  You know? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5646.0s)]
*  And that, I think, has turned out to be true with these platforms. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5646.400000000001s)]
*  They're increasingly just sort of intertwined with the state. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5651.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5654.72s)]
*  So it's state media. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5655.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5656.400000000001s)]
*  And this is another continuation of the war on terror thing because they began by [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5656.88s)]
*  demanding that these companies fork over information about geolocation of users [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5663.360000000001s)]
*  and other places around the world, even in the United States. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5670.56s)]
*  But now they're venturing into content, right? [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5675.04s)]
*  Content domestically that people see. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5679.6s)]
*  So Google is the biggest, of course, of all these companies and by far the most influential [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5681.76s)]
*  as a monopoly on search, which is your window into all information. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5685.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5690.16s)]
*  If we were ever to see what goes on internally at Google, what do you think we would learn? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5691.12s)]
*  Well, I think we would find that they have massively changed the formula for, you know, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5697.599999999999s)]
*  search returns. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5706.48s)]
*  I mean, they even talked about this in 2017 and 2018 when they had this thing called Project Owl, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5707.2s)]
*  which was designed to change the parameters of the search towards something they called [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5713.76s)]
*  authority. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5723.68s)]
*  And authority was basically the way it was explained to me when I talked to somebody [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5724.56s)]
*  at Google, it was like, if you search for baseball five years ago, you might have seen [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5728.88s)]
*  your local little league team. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5733.12s)]
*  Now you'll see MLB.com come up first. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5734.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5736.72s)]
*  And, you know, you've probably noticed this when you do a Google search, you know, the [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5737.6s)]
*  first 40 or 50 results will all be of a certain type and you'll have to, it's much, much harder [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5744.160000000001s)]
*  to find kind of this counter narrative version of reality now, even if you know exactly what [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5750.56s)]
*  you're looking for or type in the title of the story. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5759.360000000001s)]
*  It's made reporting harder. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5764.4800000000005s)]
*  Don't you think? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5766.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, it actually challenges your understanding, like what is reality. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5767.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5773.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5774.16s)]
*  So, I mean, the potential for mind control, or in fact, the reality of mind control by [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5774.56s)]
*  the state and by affiliated actors dependent on the state or living in a symbiotic relationship [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5780.08s)]
*  with the state, it's like, it's almost impossible to have independent thoughts. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5784.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5789.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5790.0s)]
*  I mean, if most people are getting their information through these searches [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5790.16s)]
*  and through social media exchanges and those things are heavily, heavily, you know, managed, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5794.56s)]
*  then everybody's getting a skewed version of reality and that's going to change the [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5804.72s)]
*  way that they think about everything. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5809.12s)]
*  I think that's really dangerous. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5813.28s)]
*  Obviously, it's not a new concept because we all read about it and, or well, and, you know, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5816.96s)]
*  all of this Huxley and all these other books, but, you know, what happens to people when [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5824.08s)]
*  they're getting their information in a way that's completely inorganic and false? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5829.360000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I think we have to get to the bottom of that. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5834.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5837.76s)]
*  I think it's scary. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5838.8s)]
*  Do you think there's been any slackening of it? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5841.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, we're in the middle of an election season right now. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5845.2s)]
*  It's pretty clear that the people in charge in both parties will do anything to stop Trump. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5848.4800000000005s)]
*  And for reasons probably nothing to do with Trump, actually, but bigger story, but whatever [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5853.92s)]
*  the cause, they're totally determined to control the outcome of this election. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5858.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5863.68s)]
*  Well, can you have a democracy under those circumstances? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5864.16s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5867.68s)]
*  So there was a Supreme Court case. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5870.56s)]
*  There's one that's still going on, Murthy v. Missouri. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5873.84s)]
*  And originally the lower courts ruled that the federal government can't be, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5877.92s)]
*  you know, doing that back and forth with all these platforms. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5887.28s)]
*  And from what I understood, there was a little bit of a backing off point, right? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5891.28s)]
*  Where they weren't so intimately involved. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5897.36s)]
*  But just about a month ago, Senator Mark Warner had a talk and he said that [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5900.72s)]
*  essentially the companies have begun talking to the agencies again. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5907.360000000001s)]
*  This was after the Supreme Court held a hearing on that case. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5913.68s)]
*  And it didn't look so good for the free speech advocates afterwards. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5919.280000000001s)]
*  So that tells me that they're already thinking of coming up with another program. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5922.320000000001s)]
*  I know for a fact, for stories that I'm working on, that there are a couple of different [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5930.08s)]
*  contracting ideas for new sort of content review programs that would be partnerships [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5936.8s)]
*  with government in the same way that there were the last time around. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5945.92s)]
*  Like the last time around, we had this thing called the Election Integrity Partnership. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5949.92s)]
*  It was run out of Stanford, but it was done in partnership with [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5953.360000000001s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security and the Global Engagement Center, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5958.240000000001s)]
*  which is at the State Department and the University of Washington and some other partners. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5961.92s)]
*  But that was a thing where there was a big organized content flagging operation [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5968.24s)]
*  that involved the government. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5975.04s)]
*  They're going to do something like that again. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5976.96s)]
*  It's just a question of who's going to do it, what the method is going to be. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5978.56s)]
*  And my understanding is that it's going to be more aggressive this time around. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5982.24s)]
*  So there have been a number of war games, right? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5988.400000000001s)]
*  Where academics, NGO officials, government officials, it's all sort of this blob, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5992.72s)]
*  it's kind of hard to disaggregate it, but have gamed out various election scenarios. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=5997.92s)]
*  And it sounds a little more to me like contingency planning than like an academic exercise, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6003.92s)]
*  but tell me what you know about that. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6010.64s)]
*  Well, it's interesting that you bring that up. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6012.8s)]
*  So you may have noticed in the news lately that there have been a lot of [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6015.52s)]
*  stories warning about AI deepfakes. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6021.76s)]
*  This is the new, if Russia was the excuse for getting involved in content moderation [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6025.68s)]
*  in 2020 or even 2018, AI and deepfakes are the new buzzword in Washington. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6035.360000000001s)]
*  I thought it was just a way to explain away your porn tapes. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6044.8s)]
*  That's right. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6048.56s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6049.200000000001s)]
*  I didn't make this up. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6050.160000000001s)]
*  It's a deepfake. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6052.080000000001s)]
*  But this is something that somebody took me off to. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6054.400000000001s)]
*  Now, this is not like a secret. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6057.360000000001s)]
*  It's actually public, although nobody has brought it up. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6060.080000000001s)]
*  There is a website that's out there. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6064.0s)]
*  But this is a game, it's basically Elections and Dragons. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6066.4800000000005s)]
*  It's made by InQtel. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6069.84s)]
*  You can see the IQT here, which is the venture capital arm of the CIA. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6071.52s)]
*  Stop. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6078.72s)]
*  Why does the CIA have a venture firm arm? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6079.76s)]
*  To develop technologies that would otherwise probably be prohibited. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6083.68s)]
*  Because there's a lot of things that they get into that maybe are good moneymaking ideas. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6090.0s)]
*  Part of what being in the intelligence business is about is getting out and making money. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6094.320000000001s)]
*  So, but that's kind of a problem if your intel agencies have venture arms. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6100.24s)]
*  Yes, right. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6107.12s)]
*  You would think that would be a problem. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6108.0s)]
*  So this is a CIA-funded election game. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6110.96s)]
*  Yep, it's a CIA-funded election game. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6113.679999999999s)]
*  Just to start, just like Dungeons and Dragons, it has funny dice. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6116.8s)]
*  This is a 10-sided die. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6120.48s)]
*  For the record, are you making this up? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6122.5599999999995s)]
*  Is this real? [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6123.599999999999s)]
*  This is real. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6124.24s)]
*  Haywire is the name of the game. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6125.599999999999s)]
*  If you roll the InQtel symbol, right? [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6129.599999999999s)]
*  It says on the back, if you roll... [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6135.44s)]
*  Basically, the premise of the game is that you are trying to avoid a haywire situation, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6143.28s)]
*  meaning an AI-induced disaster. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6148.32s)]
*  Where the voters get what they want. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6151.5199999999995s)]
*  Basically, yeah. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6153.599999999999s)]
*  If you roll the InQtel logo, it says, Haywire Reverted. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6155.6s)]
*  So basically, if you roll CIA, you win. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6161.28s)]
*  The CIA venture logo looks a little bit like the symbol for nuclear power. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6165.92s)]
*  It does look a little bit like that, yes. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6174.16s)]
*  So this game is used to train... [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6176.88s)]
*  From what I understand, it's used to train people in government to wargame out scenarios [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6181.36s)]
*  that may happen, right? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6188.0s)]
*  Which is why some of these scenarios are so incredible. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6190.0s)]
*  Like if an orange populist were to somehow become president again. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6196.24s)]
*  Well, right. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6200.48s)]
*  When I went through these, I know obviously I just opened this box, but I have another one. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6202.879999999999s)]
*  The one that really jumped out at me is this thing called the Purple Disappeared. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6208.16s)]
*  The Purple Disappeared. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6212.0s)]
*  If you could read out what it says. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6214.24s)]
*  Swing states appear safe on the national electoral map in early polling. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6217.2s)]
*  Later, it emerges that AI-driven election forecasts were wrong because the data scientists [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6221.599999999999s)]
*  overlook significant partisan differences that make swing states highly competitive. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6226.72s)]
*  Discuss your response plan, then draw two injects. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6231.679999999999s)]
*  Real world harm, it says at the bottom. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6236.64s)]
*  Misinformation slash social bias, heightened stress, anxiety, and depression. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6238.4800000000005s)]
*  What's social bias mean? [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6246.8s)]
*  I have no idea, but that certainly sounds to me like they're asking the game players [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6249.360000000001s)]
*  to come up with a plan for some kind of reaction to election results that don't necessarily [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6256.16s)]
*  square with what the polls were indicating, right? [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6270.32s)]
*  I mean, that's basically what they're saying in that scenario. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6272.96s)]
*  Here's another one, mind games. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6277.68s)]
*  An easy to use voice model helps create a viral video [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6280.72s)]
*  suggesting that one of the candidates may have dementia. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6284.96s)]
*  Discuss your response plan and draw two injects. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6290.96s)]
*  It's just full of stuff like this. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6295.36s)]
*  We started to hear about this idea that there were people in this information management [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6298.32s)]
*  censorship content moderation space that were deeply involved with finding new ways to manage [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6306.799999999999s)]
*  information that people see. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6320.16s)]
*  Back in 2010, the army actually got rid of the term PSYOP because they thought it had [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6322.48s)]
*  negative connotations. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6328.56s)]
*  They brought it back in 2017 because there was a widespread belief that we have to engage in [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6330.96s)]
*  influence operations that because Russia is already doing it, because China is already doing it, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6340.400000000001s)]
*  we need to do it. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6346.56s)]
*  Aimed at our own population. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6349.120000000001s)]
*  And that's the thing. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6350.96s)]
*  We did this before. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6352.88s)]
*  Previously, we created phony social media accounts in Arabic and Pashto, right? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6354.48s)]
*  And that's something that we've understood. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6360.88s)]
*  What's different is that they're now doing this in English, right? [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6363.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're now aiming this at domestic populations. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6366.5599999999995s)]
*  I thought that was illegal. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6369.36s)]
*  I would think it's illegal. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6371.599999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of this behavior is just unregulated, not looked at. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6373.36s)]
*  I mean, who's going to go in and tell them they can't do this? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6377.28s)]
*  What body is going to do? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6382.08s)]
*  The New York Times, the Washington Post. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6384.0s)]
*  Democracy dies in darkness. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6386.5599999999995s)]
*  That is the role with the press. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6389.44s)]
*  Yes, but the... [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6391.759999999999s)]
*  To expose excesses and roll them back by exposing them. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6392.32s)]
*  But the problem is that they see, for instance, Donald Trump and the Trump movement as an [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6395.759999999999s)]
*  extension of what they might call the Russian information ecosystem. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6406.0s)]
*  The Global Engagement Center, the State Department has this concept of information ecosystem. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6412.64s)]
*  So if you're too in alignment with Russian foreign policy views on, say, Ukraine or something [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6417.36s)]
*  like that, you can be part of the ecosystem even if you have nothing to do with that country. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6423.68s)]
*  So the idea that the first head of the Global Engagement Center is a former editor of Time [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6430.400000000001s)]
*  Magazine, Rick Stengel. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6438.0s)]
*  He wrote a book called Information Wars that we all had to read when we were doing the [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6440.24s)]
*  Twitter files because we didn't know about this organization. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6444.0s)]
*  Talked openly about how he thought the Trump campaign, in it he recognized the same techniques [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6448.16s)]
*  that he saw from ISIS and from Russia. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6456.96s)]
*  So they see all this as all part of a piece. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6459.68s)]
*  And that is what I think is dangerous is that we're sort of bringing the ethos of [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6464.64s)]
*  military counter messaging from the war on terror. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6470.4800000000005s)]
*  We're bringing that home and the enemy is now the domestic voter. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6473.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6478.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6478.96s)]
*  So military messaging, but the purpose of the military is to kill people in the end [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6479.2s)]
*  and to deter war by the threat of killing people. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6483.92s)]
*  But basically it's killing, that's their business. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6486.24s)]
*  Killing, yes, but also trying to discourage recruitment, right? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6488.639999999999s)]
*  Of course, right. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6492.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6493.12s)]
*  So. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6493.5199999999995s)]
*  But fundamentally, if you were to say like, what's the purpose of military? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6494.0s)]
*  It's to exert force, physical force. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6498.24s)]
*  So if the US military is turning its psyops on the country, like that's not that far, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6500.24s)]
*  the nature of organizations and mission creep from there to like hurting people. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6508.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6513.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6514.56s)]
*  And they actually, you'll find NATO, we found NATO papers that talked about how they found [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6515.04s)]
*  the American belief in inform, not influence or truthfulness. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6522.240000000001s)]
*  That was actually, that's part of an old NATO memo about influence operations that we have to see. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6530.88s)]
*  You can't tell untruths. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6538.88s)]
*  The more modern belief is that that's outdated, that because the Russians don't do that, [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6540.96s)]
*  that we have to, we shouldn't have those restraints. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6547.36s)]
*  So we have to worry now about sort of phony influence operations in the United States. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6551.36s)]
*  And if you look at it in that, things through that lens, suddenly things like Russia, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6557.2s)]
*  start to make a little bit more sense, right? [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6563.44s)]
*  Because you can imagine somebody in the intelligence service is saying, well, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6565.84s)]
*  Donald Trump is part of this nexus of anti-American forces and [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6570.88s)]
*  anything's fair game against that kind of person. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6581.2s)]
*  So what, Russia's central to all of this in the minds of the people doing it. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6583.36s)]
*  And from my perspective, as someone who's never been that interested in Russia, the country, [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6588.4s)]
*  you sort of wake up one day and, you know, 25 years after the end of the Cold War and [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6592.5599999999995s)]
*  realize you're required to hate Russia. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6597.36s)]
*  And I just refuse to go along with that. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6600.08s)]
*  I'm principal, not because I love Russia. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6601.5199999999995s)]
*  I do kind of like Russia actually having been there, but I didn't have any feelings about it [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6603.839999999999s)]
*  a year ago. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6607.36s)]
*  But I just, I'm an adult man and I don't want to be told what to think. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6609.12s)]
*  And I'm not going to be period under any circumstances because I'm not a slave. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6611.28s)]
*  But unanswered is the question like, why? [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6616.32s)]
*  Why is that a requirement of living in the United States where I've lived my whole life, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6618.5599999999995s)]
*  hating Russia? [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6623.12s)]
*  Like, what does that have to do with anything? [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6623.839999999999s)]
*  Like, how do we get there of all countries? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6624.96s)]
*  I don't understand that either. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6628.08s)]
*  And also, you don't, I mean, especially compared to when Russia actually was a major, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6629.2s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't nearly this intense in the seventies and eighties. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6638.08s)]
*  I was here. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6642.16s)]
*  It was not right. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6642.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, of course not. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6644.0s)]
*  In fact, people said, I mean, Russia was actually running actual [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6644.5599999999995s)]
*  psyops against the United States. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6648.719999999999s)]
*  AIDS was created a fort. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6650.5599999999995s)]
*  Me had to kill black people, you know, all these things. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6651.679999999999s)]
*  Like that's, that was a Russian active measures campaigns big time. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6653.36s)]
*  And of course there were all these proxy wars going on even then in Mozambique. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6657.36s)]
*  And they were like actual wars. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6661.52s)]
*  And the prevailing view among people I knew was, you know, Soviets are bad. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6663.44s)]
*  Of course, no one's pro-Soviet in normal person world, but it would be kind of nice to be at [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6669.44s)]
*  peace and nuclear war is really scary. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6674.32s)]
*  And like, let's avoid that. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6677.04s)]
*  I mean, that was the view that I remember as a child, right? [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6678.4s)]
*  Sure. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6681.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6681.68s)]
*  I mean, we had staying telling us the Russians love their children too. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6681.84s)]
*  Which is true. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6686.32s)]
*  And, you know, when Gorbachev came on the scene, I remember very distinctly people saying, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6686.96s)]
*  you know, that we have to find a way to get along with these people. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6694.88s)]
*  Like that we're spending too much money on, on defense and that this is, this is costing [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6698.4800000000005s)]
*  both of our societies. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6705.28s)]
*  But that's not where we're at now. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6708.08s)]
*  And oddly enough, the current American government, it feels a lot like the Soviet [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6710.16s)]
*  government of the early eighties, right? [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6716.8s)]
*  Where, you know, Joe Biden would, would have fit in perfectly in the politburo of the early [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6719.6s)]
*  years. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6724.64s)]
*  Brezhnev, I thought many times. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6724.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6726.4s)]
*  I mean, he's, he's the doddering old physically dead leader who his, who still has a title [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6726.8s)]
*  because, you know, he hasn't actually expired. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6734.48s)]
*  Presiding over a decade, cynical society that no longer believes in the slogans. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6736.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6741.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, the Russians have a joke where Gorbachev gets in the limousine. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6741.76s)]
*  He's late for work. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6749.6s)]
*  So he drives too fast. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6750.400000000001s)]
*  The cops pull him over. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6751.76s)]
*  And his Gorbachev's driver is drunk, passed out in the back. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6754.08s)]
*  So he had to drive himself. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6758.8s)]
*  He gets stopped by the police and the cop sees him, salutes, goes back to the car. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6760.160000000001s)]
*  And the other cop says, who is that? [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6765.2s)]
*  And he goes, I don't know, but garbage office is driver. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6767.04s)]
*  And that's how you feel about America. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6770.88s)]
*  Now who's running this country? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6772.88s)]
*  Does anybody know who is running the country? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6775.12s)]
*  Is it Jake Sullivan? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6778.08s)]
*  I mean, I mean, you'd have to make a guess. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6779.12s)]
*  Would you, wouldn't you? [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6781.84s)]
*  I mean, somebody has to have the final say about these things and it can't be Biden. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6783.12s)]
*  I just think that's a very weird thing to not know. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6788.48s)]
*  And no one seems curious about it either. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6791.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6793.28s)]
*  Where are the stories about that? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6793.84s)]
*  Who's that? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6795.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, the Wall Street Journal just did a story about that. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6795.52s)]
*  You read it? [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6798.32s)]
*  They broke the seal on that. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6798.96s)]
*  But it's kind of a silly, dishonest story, but in it were quite a silly, dishonest story. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6800.64s)]
*  I thought, but whatever. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6807.2s)]
*  But there were certainly things in there that had not been in the Wall Street Journal or big paper before. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6807.84s)]
*  For sure. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6812.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6812.72s)]
*  They took a, you know, they dipped a toe in the lake of, right? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6814.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6818.08s)]
*  But still, you know, in a real country, we would be scrambling to find out. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6818.56s)]
*  Well, the president is clearly not capable. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6824.400000000001s)]
*  So what's going on? [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6827.84s)]
*  You know, nothing. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6829.04s)]
*  There's not a hint of anything, which is just, it's so bizarre. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6832.0s)]
*  Well, and especially given the consequences, I mean, if this were 1995, you could sort of sit [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6835.84s)]
*  and sort of run some autopilot and, you know, Tim Cook and the captains of industry can pitch [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6840.080000000001s)]
*  in and sort of keep us on the track. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6844.64s)]
*  I mean, that would be the view, right? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6846.8s)]
*  But now we are on the brink. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6848.32s)]
*  We're closer to nuclear war than we've ever been, closer than the Cuban Missile Crisis right now. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6850.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6854.5599999999995s)]
*  To total nuclear annihilation. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6855.12s)]
*  And if the commander in chief is noncompensatis, and I mean, the ship is listing, it's on its side. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6857.2s)]
*  Where are the people saying, you know, I hate Trump, I love Biden, [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6864.08s)]
*  politics don't even matter at this level. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6867.76s)]
*  We're on the verge of nuclear war? [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6869.92s)]
*  That's not acceptable. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6872.719999999999s)]
*  Let's pull back. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6874.08s)]
*  I have not even heard any person say that. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6875.12s)]
*  What is that? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6878.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6879.28s)]
*  Where's the public concern about that either? [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6880.08s)]
*  I mean, if this were 1986, and we were at this level of antagonism with Russia, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6883.36s)]
*  if there had been an exploded pipeline, if there was a shooting war in Ukraine, right? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6891.28s)]
*  Or some kind of proxy territory where our weapons were killing Russian troops and vice versa. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6897.44s)]
*  Because, you know, some of ours were over there too. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6904.48s)]
*  Quite a few. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6907.44s)]
*  And, you know, people would be panicking, right? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6908.16s)]
*  Because at any minute, you know, we're all relying on somebody like Putin being rational, [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6912.08s)]
*  which is already, you know, I made that mistake in thinking that he would never invade Ukraine. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6918.32s)]
*  I thought that too. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6924.879999999999s)]
*  And so, what are we banking on the idea that if, you know, we if we launch some kind of a weapon [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6925.839999999999s)]
*  into the Russian territory that they're not going to hit us? [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6933.92s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6937.52s)]
*  I mean, I think the people who are prosecuting the conflict from our side, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6939.28s)]
*  I'm very familiar with their mindset because I knew a lot of these folks when I was in Russia. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6947.92s)]
*  They're not, it's kind of like all the presidents men. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6953.6s)]
*  These aren't very bright guys. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6956.56s)]
*  And things have gotten out of hand. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6958.64s)]
*  And I think that they have no idea what they're doing. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6960.4s)]
*  And this could easily get out of hand very, very quickly because they're messianic about this. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6965.679999999999s)]
*  They think they must continue this conflict. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6972.879999999999s)]
*  Whereas the one thing that I thought Barack Obama was sensible about was, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6977.599999999999s)]
*  you know, when the Crimea thing happened, he said, look, it's not, you know, [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6980.879999999999s)]
*  it's always going to be more important to them than it is to us. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6985.2s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6987.839999999999s)]
*  Very important to them, by the way. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6988.4s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6990.08s)]
*  So I hear these people, including the US ambassador to Ukraine and, but many others, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6990.88s)]
*  just sort of blithely announced that, well, we're going to take Crimea. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6994.64s)]
*  And that, again, I don't have strong feelings about Crimea. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=6999.5199999999995s)]
*  I've never been there, but I think I know as a factual matter that that is a trigger [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7002.4s)]
*  for nuclear war right there. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7006.64s)]
*  For sure, for sure. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7008.32s)]
*  And it, you know, it's kind of a jump ball also, like, should that place be? [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7009.68s)]
*  I think it is Russian at this point, but. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7015.6s)]
*  Right. And it's been Russian historically. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7017.76s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of weird stuff about Ukraine's history, like the, you know, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7020.320000000001s)]
*  the fact that they gave the, they created the territory as sort of on a whim, [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7024.08s)]
*  you know, in the middle of the Soviet period. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7029.52s)]
*  The lines are very arbitrary. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7032.88s)]
*  They're not drawn along, you know, real linguistic or cultural lines. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7034.96s)]
*  And if you've heard, if you've been to the place, you'll find that it's, [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7038.88s)]
*  it's very Russian in some parts and very Ukrainian in others. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7042.72s)]
*  I'm sure that's changing now, but the people who are pushing this, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7046.08s)]
*  they have no knowledge of that whatsoever. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7052.72s)]
*  It's the same thing as when I was in Russia, they've been told one thing. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7054.5599999999995s)]
*  And so, you know, Ukraine to them is like Switzerland and we're saving it from Russia. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7059.2s)]
*  Whereas the reality is that it's nothing like that in reality. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7065.2s)]
*  And I don't know how dangerous do you think they are? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7070.5599999999995s)]
*  I think they're crazy. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7073.68s)]
*  I think they're the most dangerous. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7075.120000000001s)]
*  I think they're seized by hubris. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7076.88s)]
*  I think there is a messy inequality to this. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7079.04s)]
*  I think the entire leadership class of the country is determined to commit suicide. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7080.96s)]
*  I think that they've boxed themselves in. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7086.72s)]
*  They're criminals. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7088.88s)]
*  They know that they will be exposed as such. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7089.68s)]
*  And they've also reached kind of the apogee of American empire anyway. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7091.6s)]
*  It's all downhill from here. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7095.04s)]
*  I do think that they feel this. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7096.8s)]
*  And I think they want to extinguish the society. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7099.280000000001s)]
*  That's such an incredibly dark thing to say. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7103.28s)]
*  I hesitate even to say it, but I don't see a rational explanation for any of this behavior [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7104.799999999999s)]
*  at all. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7110.0s)]
*  I don't think it advances anyone's aims, including their own. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7110.24s)]
*  I don't believe that Larry Fink is like orchestrating all this so Black Rock can get even richer. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7113.12s)]
*  I think they want to get richer. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7117.839999999999s)]
*  I think Larry Fink's a bad guy, obviously. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7119.12s)]
*  But I don't think it's- [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7121.12s)]
*  Or Lockheed Martin. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7121.839999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7123.04s)]
*  The defense contractors and that. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7123.759999999999s)]
*  That's all true on one level, but that's not the explanation. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7125.44s)]
*  No. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7129.36s)]
*  No, it's way deeper than that. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7129.839999999999s)]
*  I think it's a spiritual thing. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7131.44s)]
*  And I do think societies kill themselves just as people do. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7133.2s)]
*  And I think that's what we're seeing. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7138.16s)]
*  Clearly, that's what we're seeing. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7139.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, tell me how that's not what we're seeing. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7141.28s)]
*  And I think that's just such an ugly idea. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7143.44s)]
*  Again, it hurts me to articulate it, but you asked. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7146.96s)]
*  So that's what I honestly think. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7150.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, what other explanation is there? [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7151.919999999999s)]
*  Well, kind of. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7155.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7155.759999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7155.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, I've kind of run out of... [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7156.32s)]
*  I made the mistake, I think, for years of trying to think, [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7160.0s)]
*  well, what's the angle on this? [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7163.44s)]
*  That's right. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7164.719999999999s)]
*  That's how I thought. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7165.12s)]
*  You know? [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7165.84s)]
*  Like, there's got to be some end game that they're going for. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7166.24s)]
*  And the only way to make sense of this is to give that up, I think. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7171.36s)]
*  Because there's something darker going on in the culture of people who run this country. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7175.599999999999s)]
*  That it's inaccessible if you're trying to assign motives to it. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7183.04s)]
*  Just to take the problem of Donald Trump. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7189.44s)]
*  They could easily defeat Donald Trump as a political entity if they were thinking as [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7191.36s)]
*  political consultants did in the 90s or 80s. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7198.8s)]
*  They would just make some subtle adjustments. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7203.04s)]
*  They would throw a bone to working people. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7205.28s)]
*  And they would put forward a candidate who isn't physically dead and they would win. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7208.719999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7218.24s)]
*  But no. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7218.799999999999s)]
*  For them, I think it's a principle that a certain kind of voter not have a say in things. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7220.4s)]
*  That's just totally counterintuitive to me. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7228.08s)]
*  I just don't understand that. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7230.5599999999995s)]
*  So in other words, it's not just Trump. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7235.04s)]
*  It's the idea that the people who like Trump, those people might have power or be rewarded. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7237.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7244.48s)]
*  We cannot legitimize the negative feelings of those voters, is how they think. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7246.8s)]
*  Whereas it's incredibly obvious if you go out in the campaign trail and talk to people who [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7254.64s)]
*  vote for Trump, that they do it for a million different reasons. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7261.44s)]
*  Ranging from the town that I live in used to be a booming economic center and now it's dead. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7265.52s)]
*  Right? [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7274.400000000001s)]
*  It looks like a third world country. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7275.6s)]
*  There isn't a functioning hospital within 300 miles of where I live. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7279.52s)]
*  The Walmart is now the only place where you can buy anything for 50 miles. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7283.12s)]
*  Like there's a million reasons. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7286.88s)]
*  Then there's some social issues too. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7291.84s)]
*  But once upon a time, I remember not so long ago, even Bill Clinton talking about trying [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7294.72s)]
*  to reclaim some of those working class voters. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7300.4800000000005s)]
*  And that was like a legitimate activity. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7303.68s)]
*  Bill Clinton won West Virginia. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7305.4400000000005s)]
*  He won every county in West Virginia. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7307.6s)]
*  Imagine every county in West Virginia in 1992. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7309.280000000001s)]
*  And of course, I think he lost California. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7314.16s)]
*  Wow. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7316.400000000001s)]
*  And so imagine a Democrat winning any county in West Virginia. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7317.04s)]
*  Well, they wouldn't want to win. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7322.56s)]
*  No, they wouldn't. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7323.76s)]
*  Right? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7325.2s)]
*  That's totally true. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7325.52s)]
*  Right? [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7326.88s)]
*  That's totally true. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7327.2s)]
*  I mean, they go in there with this scolding attitude. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7328.08s)]
*  Learn the code. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7331.280000000001s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7332.400000000001s)]
*  There's this punitive attitude about it, which is, as you know, if you've covered campaigns, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7335.04s)]
*  you cannot win if you have hostility towards the voters. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7341.04s)]
*  Well, that's Trump's secret is he doesn't hate them. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7344.8s)]
*  He loves them. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7346.96s)]
*  I know. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7347.68s)]
*  That was immediately apparent from his first campaign is that he got up there [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7349.280000000001s)]
*  and people say, well, what does a billionaire have in common with ordinary people? [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7353.36s)]
*  He's liked them in a lot of ways. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7359.28s)]
*  He has the same. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7360.639999999999s)]
*  He probably does the same thing in the spare time. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7362.32s)]
*  He goes to the same websites. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7364.4s)]
*  And we eat to the same restaurant. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7366.24s)]
*  We know that. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7367.679999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7368.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7368.5599999999995s)]
*  And so when he opens his mouth, people think, yeah, I can connect with this guy. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7369.839999999999s)]
*  Now, a lot of it is fake. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7375.36s)]
*  Right? [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7379.28s)]
*  And the policy prescriptions may not make any sense, but you can understand why. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7379.6s)]
*  At the level of Viceroy, he's affection. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7385.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7390.320000000001s)]
*  And they have hate. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7390.96s)]
*  And I think that's the thing that shocks me most. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7391.84s)]
*  Like, I think I'm way too autistic or something to understand a lot of the things that are [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7394.160000000001s)]
*  happening right now. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7398.240000000001s)]
*  But I think in terms of like, well, outcomes. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7398.8s)]
*  And that's not what any of this is about. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7403.200000000001s)]
*  And the thing that shocks me most is the actual hostility that people in DC, where [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7405.36s)]
*  effectively I'm from, have for the rest of the country. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7410.719999999999s)]
*  Like, they hate the people in the country. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7413.12s)]
*  They do. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7414.719999999999s)]
*  They don't just look down on them. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7415.599999999999s)]
*  I thought it was just like looking down on them in a snobbish way. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7416.719999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7418.88s)]
*  No, it's like a hostility. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7419.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7420.88s)]
*  When they die. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7421.04s)]
*  And you saw this during COVID. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7422.4s)]
*  Oh, he didn't get the vaccine. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7423.599999999999s)]
*  He died. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7424.48s)]
*  I'm glad he died. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7425.12s)]
*  Like, I'm glad he died. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7425.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7426.88s)]
*  American. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7427.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7428.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7428.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7428.88s)]
*  I'm not happy when a gang member dies in the South Side of Chicago. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7429.36s)]
*  No, I'm serious. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7433.2s)]
*  I couldn't be more opposed to gang members South Side of Chicago. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7434.24s)]
*  But like, I don't know. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7436.16s)]
*  It's like a, it's a human being. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7437.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7438.96s)]
*  American. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7439.2s)]
*  Like, I think it's sad actually. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7439.76s)]
*  Oh, I mean, the hostility during the COVID thing was also, it was unbelievable to watch. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7441.84s)]
*  What was that? [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7446.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7447.28s)]
*  I mean, Jimmy Kimmel does this whole Annie Vax Barbie thing where it's just, you know, [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7447.5199999999995s)]
*  it's the worst kind of, you know, cosmopolitan looking down at the, at the, at the HIC kind of [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7454.16s)]
*  thing. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7460.72s)]
*  And, and they, they hate these people. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7461.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7464.320000000001s)]
*  But why? [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7464.56s)]
*  I don't understand. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7465.68s)]
*  You know, like once upon again, not long ago, entertainers wanted to connect with ordinary [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7466.88s)]
*  people. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7474.240000000001s)]
*  Now they, they don't like that audience. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7474.56s)]
*  They wouldn't want to get applauded from that audience. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7476.400000000001s)]
*  And politicians don't either. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7481.360000000001s)]
*  They, they, they want to be elected by the right people or they want to, they want to [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7483.12s)]
*  do it without the help of the wrong kind of voters, but they can't because they're outnumbered. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7488.88s)]
*  You know? [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7494.0s)]
*  So I, it's a crazy time, but, but I do think you're right that if you try to figure this [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7495.2s)]
*  out by assigning rational motives to any of this, it doesn't make any sense. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7502.96s)]
*  It won't work. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7507.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7508.400000000001s)]
*  So we're on a slide, as you said, at the very outset into authoritarian government, a different, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7508.88s)]
*  certainly a different form of government, not a democratic government at all. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7514.96s)]
*  Some kind of oligarchy. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7519.6s)]
*  I'm already there. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7521.52s)]
*  Does that, is there any way to arrest that or slow it down? [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7523.04s)]
*  Is it inevitable? [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7526.08s)]
*  Like what, if you could project, what would, what do you see? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7527.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't think so. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7530.96s)]
*  Part of the reason that I'm so spun up about a lot of, a lot of the stuff that's happening [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7534.56s)]
*  is because I got to, I watched what happened when, you know, speech freedoms, even limited [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7539.12s)]
*  ones like the ones in Russia, they disappear. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7545.4400000000005s)]
*  They don't come back, you know, like that, that's kind of what happens. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7547.84s)]
*  And, uh, they don't come back. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7551.28s)]
*  That's true. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7553.6s)]
*  Isn't it? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7554.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7554.72s)]
*  And, and, you know, in the United States, uh, there was a reverence once for, for, um, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7555.04s)]
*  the first amendment for the whole bill of rights that it just doesn't exist anymore. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7563.360000000001s)]
*  There's this kind of like defeatist or unbelieving attitude about it. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7568.08s)]
*  And that's been another revelation of, you know, working on stories like the Twitter [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7572.400000000001s)]
*  files is finding out that people don't really, they don't have the same feeling about the [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7576.56s)]
*  first amendment that people did in the eighties and nineties or even the early two thousands. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7581.6s)]
*  I mean, even Rob Reiner does the American president, right? [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7586.64s)]
*  And it's all about how, um, you know, the ACLU and, you know, being allowed to burn [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7589.6s)]
*  the flag and he's, you know, he's on the other side of this thing now, right? [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7595.360000000001s)]
*  Like, and, and so what happened to all those people? [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7601.76s)]
*  What happened to that? [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7605.04s)]
*  That belief in the system may mean for all of them, uh, you know, you mentioned that you and I [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7606.24s)]
*  came from probably from different political, uh, places at one point in time. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7612.72s)]
*  I think we probably both share a belief that America on some level worked, right? [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7618.96s)]
*  It had, it had all kinds of flaws. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7624.24s)]
*  Um, but you know, immigrants came here from all over the world. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7627.12s)]
*  They built good lives and they chose to stay here. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7631.04s)]
*  I mean, my family, you know, came from different parts of the world and, um, this, [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7634.16s)]
*  this country is screwed up. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7639.2s)]
*  I like the fact that it's screwed up, uh, but it works. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7641.12s)]
*  This, this, this system, um, has, has been a great thing and people don't believe that. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7644.5599999999995s)]
*  I think they've lost that belief, I think, um, which is so sad. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7649.44s)]
*  Uh, I don't know. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7654.8s)]
*  Do you feel that? [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7656.48s)]
*  I mean, I feel it really strongly. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7657.12s)]
*  And I also feel that, um, any semblance of national unity or common belief, shared culture, [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7659.28s)]
*  even shared language, but particularly the culture, um, is gone. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7666.4s)]
*  And I noticed it in talking to you because actually, you know, maybe you voted for one [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7670.72s)]
*  guy voted for the other, but our core beliefs about the, you just articulated them right there. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7675.28s)]
*  I've never doubted that a day in my life. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7679.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7681.76s)]
*  I just didn't, you know, cause like, yeah, America, yeah, screwed up in a lot of ways, [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7682.16s)]
*  of course. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7686.4800000000005s)]
*  First of all, it's huge. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7687.2s)]
*  So of course it's screwed up. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7687.92s)]
*  Everything big is screwed up. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7688.96s)]
*  But the best, the system works. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7691.2s)]
*  And, um, I don't feel that there's a national consensus on that at all anymore. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7694.48s)]
*  And it seemed to have evaporated very, very fast. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7699.44s)]
*  And I'm not quite sure how, maybe that's the problem with being in your fifties, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7701.84s)]
*  things change and you didn't see the change coming. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7705.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7708.32s)]
*  That's still a mystery, right? [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7709.2s)]
*  Like where did that happen? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7710.5599999999995s)]
*  There had to have been a moment in time where. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7712.24s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you part of what happened is the people who were deputized to defend it, [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7714.8s)]
*  refused to, and mixed angles of the world who was supposed to be, he was literally a guardian [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7718.08s)]
*  in the first amendment. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7723.52s)]
*  He's the editor of time magazine. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7724.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7725.6s)]
*  And all the next thing you know, he's a federal official working for Obama against the first [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7725.84s)]
*  amendment. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7729.52s)]
*  And you're like, well, that's a dereliction of duty. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7729.92s)]
*  That's a major sin. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7732.0s)]
*  I think it's a crime. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7733.28s)]
*  I think you should be punished for that. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7734.16s)]
*  Actually, you can't allow that. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7735.28s)]
*  I mean, if you're in a battle and the officers desert, they get shot for that. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7737.4400000000005s)]
*  Not allowed to do that. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7741.28s)]
*  Like you need leadership in order to preserve whatever it is that you have. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7742.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7746.0s)]
*  And so I blame the leaders a hundred percent. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7746.88s)]
*  And without leadership, of course, things fall apart and no one's willing to stand [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7748.639999999999s)]
*  and be like, no, you know, the dignity of the average person is not just a good thing. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7751.84s)]
*  It's the core of the enterprise. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7758.4s)]
*  It's essential. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7760.24s)]
*  You give that up, we're done. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7760.96s)]
*  And, you know, you're not allowed to do this. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7763.28s)]
*  Period. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7766.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7767.36s)]
*  And, you know, not now, you know, the role, the role of the media, I think is an important [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7769.839999999999s)]
*  one in American society. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7777.28s)]
*  We were given a very important responsibility to, to tell the public when things aren't [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7780.639999999999s)]
*  going right. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7788.24s)]
*  And to do that continually, no matter what, you know, the, which way the political winds [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7789.92s)]
*  are blowing, stick to that. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7796.88s)]
*  And so now it's kind of more important than ever to, to keep, to keep doing that. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7800.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, you asked me like, what does this get turned around? [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7804.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7807.52s)]
*  But the only thing I know is I think, you know, you have to keep doing this stuff and [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7808.0s)]
*  telling people about it in the hopes that it will get turned around. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7814.64s)]
*  So last question, you, you spent 10 years within a society that, you know, punished [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7817.84s)]
*  journalists physically at times for telling the truth. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7824.8s)]
*  You're watching political figures go to jail and whatever you think of the charges or [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7829.12s)]
*  convictions or whatever, in every single case, you know, for a dead certain fact, that person [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7834.88s)]
*  hadn't been in politics on the wrong side, he would not be going to jail. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7838.88s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7841.6s)]
*  So they're using jail as a political instrument. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7843.360000000001s)]
*  How long until that comes to journalists? [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7847.12s)]
*  Like, do you worry that at this rate, like you wind up indicted? [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7849.68s)]
*  I've, I've started for the first time to worry about that. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7855.76s)]
*  You know, because because I spent so much time in Russia and I knew people who, [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7859.68s)]
*  you know, physically suffered for what they did, right. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7864.400000000001s)]
*  Whenever people talked about taking risks as a journalist in the United States, I always [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7867.4400000000005s)]
*  said, look, please, you know, like in other parts of the world, they actually go through [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7871.04s)]
*  hardship. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7875.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7876.320000000001s)]
*  Try that in Mexico. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7876.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7877.52s)]
*  See what happens, you know? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7879.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7880.08s)]
*  You know, but it's gotten weird here. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7881.84s)]
*  I mean, even looked even, even the Bannon story, there's an element of that where [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7883.68s)]
*  it may not be as much about him as a political figure as it is about war room necessarily. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7889.04s)]
*  Well, it's a hundred percent that right. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7895.84s)]
*  And no one wants to say it, but at this point in his life, as of today, Steve Bannon is [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7897.84s)]
*  a journalist. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7901.84s)]
*  That's what he is. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7902.4800000000005s)]
*  You may disagree with him completely. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7903.200000000001s)]
*  He hosts a talk show every day. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7904.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7907.200000000001s)]
*  It's like, what is that? [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7907.4400000000005s)]
*  And the most influential one. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7909.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7910.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7911.12s)]
*  And, you know, you hear people like Rick Wilson getting up and saying, yeah, it's four months, [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7911.84s)]
*  but it's four important months. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7916.88s)]
*  It's where it's four key months. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7918.64s)]
*  He said, you know, like, you know, the Republican strategist, he said that. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7919.84s)]
*  The Lincoln Project. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7925.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7926.32s)]
*  The Lincoln Project guy and the former Dick Cheney aid, you know, like I saw that and I [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7926.4800000000005s)]
*  was like, wow, they were kind of saying that out in the open, you know? [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7931.68s)]
*  And, and even, even my experience, look, look, you had the FISA thing happened. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7934.4800000000005s)]
*  When I, when I did the Twitter files and IRS agent showed up in my house while I was [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7941.52s)]
*  testifying to Congress. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7945.52s)]
*  So that's absolutely crazy. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7950.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7951.92s)]
*  No, I thought it had to be a coincidence, but I don't think I now no longer think it [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7952.16s)]
*  is. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7958.0s)]
*  And I do worry about it. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7958.24s)]
*  I mean, I haven't even shared this with my wife yet, but I thought it might be time for [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7959.6s)]
*  us to get another house in some other place that doesn't have an extradition treaty. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7963.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7968.400000000001s)]
*  Well, there aren't many, you know? [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7968.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7970.88s)]
*  Which is a problem. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7971.12s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware of that. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7972.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7973.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7973.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7973.6s)]
*  And I never had those thoughts even, even a year ago, but you must have had them. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7974.16s)]
*  I've had some thoughts. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7982.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7983.6s)]
*  I've had some experiences that, you know, pretty shocking, I would say. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7983.84s)]
*  Not interested in talking about it, but yeah, for sure. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7988.8s)]
*  Really, really shocking, but it's still kind of all hard to believe. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7990.88s)]
*  I guess it's always that way, right? [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7995.2s)]
*  When your society changes, it's hard to believe it's actually happening. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7996.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, it's happened slowly. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=7999.52s)]
*  Somewhere along the line, I became conscious of the fact that obviously somebody must be [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8004.4800000000005s)]
*  listening to, you know, the people who I have in my contacts list, a lot of them are [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8009.4400000000005s)]
*  out of the country or running from the law or on the wrong side of the intelligence services. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8016.56s)]
*  And, you know, there's no way that somebody's not aware of what's going on, you know, of [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8022.72s)]
*  what I do. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8031.68s)]
*  And that's unnerving on one level. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8032.08s)]
*  But yes, this recent thing about, you know, even the stuff involving the Epic Times and [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8034.4800000000005s)]
*  Alex Jones, you know, I was never a fan of his. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8045.280000000001s)]
*  He had some choice things to say about me, but I think this whole thing started with [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8049.28s)]
*  the decision to take him off the internet. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8054.639999999999s)]
*  And that's troubling, you know? [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8058.5599999999995s)]
*  They clearly see journalists and information as a threat. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8062.96s)]
*  And I don't think it's an accident that there aren't that many places left to publish. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8069.12s)]
*  And there aren't that many people left doing real journalism. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8075.68s)]
*  So yeah. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8079.200000000001s)]
*  Do you think Twitter will stay open for the duration of the election? [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8079.76s)]
*  Yeah, it probably will. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8085.360000000001s)]
*  But, you know, Trump's not on anymore. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8089.92s)]
*  I mean, Trump's Twitter account is what won him, I think, the 2016 election. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8092.240000000001s)]
*  And that was one of the reasons I think journalists hate him is because [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8099.04s)]
*  he proved that in the internet age, you don't need reporters. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8102.08s)]
*  That's right. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8106.56s)]
*  If you're a politician, they couldn't stand that. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8107.04s)]
*  I mean, I listened to those conversations. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8109.92s)]
*  They were very resentful, the fact that he didn't have to go through their approval system. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8112.56s)]
*  But he's not on Twitter anymore. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8121.76s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, it's extraordinary that Joe Biden's the only candidate in this election [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8123.76s)]
*  who hasn't been censored in some way. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8130.56s)]
*  RFK has been censored. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8133.200000000001s)]
*  Brahmaswami has been booted off LinkedIn for periods of time. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8134.8s)]
*  I mean, like... [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8138.72s)]
*  Jill Stein, for that matter? [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8139.92s)]
*  Jill Stein. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8141.120000000001s)]
*  We found her in the Twitter fell. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8142.160000000001s)]
*  She was on a list called is underscore Russian, which was... [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8143.52s)]
*  Jill Stein? [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8148.56s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8149.280000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8150.400000000001s)]
*  Can they hear themselves? [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8152.160000000001s)]
*  I mean, can they? [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8153.120000000001s)]
*  By the way, I like Jill Stein and know Jill Stein, not against Jill Stein, [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8154.320000000001s)]
*  not voting for her, but like fine. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8157.76s)]
*  But if you find yourself thinking that Jill Stein, Dr. Jill Stein is the threat to America, [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8160.0s)]
*  like you're a buffoon too. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8167.04s)]
*  But they think that, right? [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8169.52s)]
*  They have the hostility towards Jill Stein the same way they had a hostility [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8173.12s)]
*  toward Ralph Nader once in a day. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8177.84s)]
*  And the difference is now, if you're Jill Stein, they see you as part of the Trump [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8180.96s)]
*  apparatus. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8188.08s)]
*  You're no different from Trump to them. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8189.76s)]
*  Assange, Jill Stein, ISIS, whatever, they're all lumped together. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8192.16s)]
*  Ed Snowden. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8197.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8197.84s)]
*  So Snowden, exactly. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8198.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8199.44s)]
*  So these are crazy times. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8200.24s)]
*  Is there anything that could get you to stop? [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8203.44s)]
*  No. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8207.28s)]
*  I mean, I've got kids, so I'm obviously not completely invulnerable, right? [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8207.68s)]
*  But I think the world, America needs journalists. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8212.08s)]
*  And again, the first thing that we have to be is tough about it, right? [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8218.8s)]
*  And so you got to get knocked off before you give up. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8225.52s)]
*  I think you shouldn't give up, right? [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8229.28s)]
*  All my heroes in journalism didn't do that. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8232.88s)]
*  So I'm not going to do that, I don't think. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8235.28s)]
*  But I mean, you wouldn't, would you? [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8238.72s)]
*  Under any circumstances. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8241.519999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8242.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8243.839999999998s)]
*  Matt Taibbi, thank you. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8245.199999999999s)]
*  Thanks so much, Tucker. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8246.4s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyADwZrQFqE&t=8247.279999999999s)]
