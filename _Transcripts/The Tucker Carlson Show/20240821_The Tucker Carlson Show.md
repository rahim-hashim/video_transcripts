**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs)
*  You having a pretty good Democratic convention so far? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=0.0s)]
*  It's awful [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3.92s)]
*  We found a way we think we can make it a little bit better or at least entertaining so Thursday night [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6.24s)]
*  930 Eastern Time we are going live in real time to relate react to Carmela Harris's primetime speech [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=11.76s)]
*  Joining us will be Jason Whitlock our old friend one of the best at this set at this table to assess her speech as [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=18.88s)]
*  She gives it in real time. This is airing only at Tucker Carlson [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=26.44s)]
*  Calm and we highly recommend you join us we invite you in fact in the meantime [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=31.84s)]
*  Here's our latest episode with Bethany Hamilton [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=36.92s)]
*  How do you deal with fear [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=56.12s)]
*  Okay, so I deal with fear [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=58.68s)]
*  Maybe more naturally and better than your average human [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  But I would say it's not like a really thoughtful process for me [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  It's truly just facing my fears and not letting my fears like [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=69.64s)]
*  overtake me so much that I get paralyzed and so I think [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=73.96s)]
*  Maybe since I you know, I've been in the world for a while now [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  I think maybe since I you know when I lost my arm when I was 13 years old [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=83.56s)]
*  I had such a deep passion for surfing that my decision to get back in the ocean was [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=89.56s)]
*  based off of like [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=95.64s)]
*  Getting back to my passion and my love for riding waves and not [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Just facing my fears, you know [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=101.64s)]
*  I had like a deeper reason like I just loved doing what I did [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=103.16s)]
*  And so I wanted to see if it was possible with one arm [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=107.4s)]
*  So I truly just faced my fears and over time [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=110.27999999999999s)]
*  I think facing them over and over and over again. I [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=114.28s)]
*  Eventually became less fearful of sharks so to say [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  And it's funny. I've heard that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=122.28s)]
*  sharks and motivational speaking are like [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=125.24s)]
*  people's two greatest fears [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's like the two things that I do I surf with sharks in the ocean [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  Or I've like, you know overcome my like incident with the shark and then [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=136.68s)]
*  I do motivational speaking which I would say I didn't like that at first [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=141.16s)]
*  But eventually I overcame that like that dislike or that fear or that uncomfortability [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=145.48s)]
*  And I think so often in life we naturally want to like run from discomfort [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=151.56s)]
*  You know, we want to make things as easy and worse comfortable as possible [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=157.32s)]
*  And so if you can learn to recognize that sometimes you can't do that and sometimes you have to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=162.04s)]
*  Like walk into uncomfortable, you know, I find them like relationships for example [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes you have to have the uncomfortable [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  conversations [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=177.14s)]
*  To make that relationship more beautiful. Yes, but a lot of us just want to like avoid that instead and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  The in the long run that just makes the relationship less beautiful and less meaningful [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=187.24s)]
*  And less filled with depth and then eventually that relationship [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=192.92s)]
*  May dissipate [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=196.76s)]
*  Absolutely, right. Um [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=199.0s)]
*  That's a more subtle process [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=201.32s)]
*  Of course that's sort of like, you know getting diabetes doesn't happen all at once. It's like over time [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=203.64s)]
*  Getting in the ocean to go surfing again is a very abrupt experience [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=209.32s)]
*  Yeah, and I think for me it wasn't like I was going out to like the sharkiest location, you know [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  As a surfer there's certain spots that you're like, oh I got the heebie-jeebies here or you know when you surf at sunset [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=220.76s)]
*  Hour or if the water is a little more murky you're like, oh this feels a little more like sketchy or more uncomfortable [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=227.16s)]
*  So I started off in like the shallow clear blue waters and it was so [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=233.64s)]
*  My initial surf with one arm [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=238.6s)]
*  Wasn't filled with a deep fear like of course I was thinking of them. I mean it was so recent [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=241.0s)]
*  I started surfing with one arm [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=247.16s)]
*  Three and a half weeks after I lost my arm three and a half weeks. Yeah [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's that's why I was on a mission [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=254.04s)]
*  I basically went as soon as the doctor said I could and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=256.68s)]
*  my my healing was really fast because everything was really clean cut and I had a great surgeon and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=260.12s)]
*  You know, I just had one of those cases that was um, I would say a little easier than most [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  You know trauma traumatic limb loss [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  And so here I am less than four weeks later getting back on my board [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=276.28s)]
*  And what did your parents say? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  Uh, I think my mom was scared that I wouldn't be able to do it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=283.0s)]
*  So she's trying to come up with new, you know options like you could be a photographer or like we can go [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  To we can go to the mountain and snowboard [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=293.08s)]
*  um [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  But my dad [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=297.8s)]
*  I think he saw it and he was like, let's go [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=299.4s)]
*  And he was like there with me trying to help me catch my first waves and i'm like no dad [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  I got this on my own and lo and behold I popped up on my third wave and rode it all the way to the beach and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=308.2s)]
*  felt like one of the best waves in my life just tears of joy and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=315.32s)]
*  Just that sense of like wow I can do this [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=319.96s)]
*  Yeah, I I surfed as a child. I don't I don't see how just the paddling part. I don't see how you could do that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=323.96s)]
*  Yes, it's definitely I've adopted in my own unique way and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=330.28s)]
*  Thankfully, I have one really strong arm. So we make the most of what we got here [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=335.96s)]
*  But [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=342.52s)]
*  Yeah, my approach to catching waves is different like a lot of times people will take like 10 15 strokes [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  Whereas me i'm trying to position as close to the takeoff as possible so that I take one to three strokes [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  To catch the wave and so it's definitely different. Um [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=356.44s)]
*  But I make it work [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=360.84s)]
*  Wow, but your father didn't hesitate in bringing you back to the ocean. No, I think my dad just he [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=362.76s)]
*  Like both my parents were surfers so they get it they get that love for the ocean they get that need to like [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=368.44s)]
*  Get back out there [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=374.68s)]
*  And yeah, you know you could be fearful of sharks [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=376.68s)]
*  I think that's like one of the number one questions I get it's like why would you go back into the ocean? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=381.08s)]
*  um [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  but for me [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=388.28s)]
*  You know [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=390.28s)]
*  It was my way of life. It was something I did every single day and even though I was young [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=391.48s)]
*  I wanted to be the best in the world and I had the potential to be the best in the world at that age like [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=397.0s)]
*  Very highly competitive. I was winning just about every event that I entered [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=402.92s)]
*  Um the summer before at 13 or 12. I finished second in the national titles in the 18 and under division [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=407.64s)]
*  So I was like kind of heading on that trajectory so to say of like she could be world champ [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  um [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=421.64s)]
*  And so on top of being competitive though like competition aside [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=422.92s)]
*  I could care less about a jersey at the end of the day [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  Like I just love being in the ocean and now fast forward. I'm a mom of four and i'm passing on my love to my children [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=429.16s)]
*  Yeah, um, you don't i'm just so struck. We just had breakfast to end [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=437.64000000000004s)]
*  Your total lack of bitterness or self-pity [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  Um, which leads to optimism and joyfulness, of course, but how how long did that take? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=446.76s)]
*  to reach [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=453.72s)]
*  I am so grateful, you know, I have [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=455.24s)]
*  My mom was very encouraging to me in my childhood to know god and to have faith [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=459.08000000000004s)]
*  And so I look at my 13 year old self and really think like childlike faith [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=465.32s)]
*  Like that's what bethany had at that time [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=469.96000000000004s)]
*  And that helped me to overcome that season and to be grateful for life. Like I woke up thinking [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=473.16s)]
*  I could have died but i'm still here and i'm so grateful to be alive [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=480.28s)]
*  And even though my life felt upside down and my future felt uncertain and like it was obviously a really hard chaotic time [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=484.44s)]
*  But I had this piece that I believe only god can bring [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=493.24s)]
*  um that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=496.52s)]
*  Even though I didn't know what my future was gonna hold I trust that there's more for my life and i'm grateful to be alive [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=498.12s)]
*  And that gratitude really pushed me forward I think like I didn't mope a lot [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=506.44s)]
*  I didn't like sit and focus on like the negative of the situation and how awful it was and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=511.32s)]
*  I would even say too like I did media really early on [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=517.5600000000001s)]
*  um [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=521.64s)]
*  Kind of willingly like as a little 13 year old because I had a heart for other people and I wanted to encourage other people and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=522.6s)]
*  So I started surfing four weeks later and then people were like, oh my gosh [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=529.88s)]
*  Just you little girls like learning how to surf with one arm right after she loses her arm to a shark [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=533.08s)]
*  So people were just awe inspired. This is like before social media, but my story truly went super viral [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=537.96s)]
*  And I would get letters from all different walks of life like inmates to like people all over the world like little girls [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=545.0s)]
*  Like if Bethany can surf with an arm I can overcome my challenge [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=552.84s)]
*  And so I had a heart for other people and so I was willing to talk about my story and like share what I had [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=557.0s)]
*  went through and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=562.44s)]
*  My desire to keep going and overcoming [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=563.72s)]
*  And but I think talking about it really helped me to overcome the trauma traumatic side of it [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=566.9200000000001s)]
*  like just facing that traumatic incident and talking about it like now I think I can think about that exact moment and I [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=572.84s)]
*  don't feel like [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=580.5200000000001s)]
*  Overwhelmed with sadness or anger or you know, it's just it is what it is sort of a feeling [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=582.58s)]
*  And I think talking about it really helped that in its [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=589.4s)]
*  If I understood you correctly you woke up the next day after losing your arm feeling grateful. Yes [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=593.24s)]
*  That's wild. Yeah, I was in the hospital and I was just really grateful to be alive [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=599.08s)]
*  And I think the doctors painted the picture of like hey you lost over 60 percent of your blood [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=604.6s)]
*  You could have died like it's a blessing that you're still here [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=609.72s)]
*  But more importantly [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=613.96s)]
*  I trusted that god had more for my life and that certainly did you know [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=616.12s)]
*  What did you think you were gonna do? Did you have any sense of what your life would look like? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=621.48s)]
*  Oh, I had no clue and I think that uncertainty felt really hard and [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=624.9200000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people who face traumatic [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=632.2s)]
*  situations [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=635.3000000000001s)]
*  They want to just get back to normal life [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=637.0s)]
*  So maybe that was part of my desire to get back into surfing was like let's just get back to normal life [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=639.1600000000001s)]
*  Like I want to be back in the ocean doing what I love being with my friends, you know [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=644.2800000000001s)]
*  And so once I proved that I could do it then there was no turning back [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=649.6400000000001s)]
*  I started surfing all day or not all day but surfing every day again and just getting back to normal life and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=654.2s)]
*  It took time to adapt and adjust and figure out how to do things and there was definitely days where I'd be completely [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=661.24s)]
*  frustrated and crying and like the waves were just sending me back to the beach and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=667.62s)]
*  Just so frustrating like I think anyone who spends time in the ocean can know that like it's such a humbling place [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=671.96s)]
*  No matter how [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=679.4s)]
*  Strong or capable you are will humble you [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=681.24s)]
*  Regardless, oh and it can hurt you at any time. Yeah, and so doing it with one arm [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=684.98s)]
*  I think that also gave me confidence to face the other challenges in my life [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=690.6s)]
*  I'm like if I can surf with one arm, what else is possible with one arm and like all the other areas in my life? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=694.6s)]
*  So [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=699.64s)]
*  It really set me on this trajectory to be willing to adapt and to just make the most of what I have [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=700.6s)]
*  And have caught and so [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=706.04s)]
*  Lo and behold little bethany just adopting in every which way [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=709.16s)]
*  Did you ever think you would have four children? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=713.32s)]
*  I always really looked forward to being a mom [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=716.04s)]
*  And I think because my mom had so much fun with me [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=718.6800000000001s)]
*  And I was a parent that she loved being a mom and that she loved adventuring with me and my brothers [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=721.72s)]
*  And I think that was one of the first things that [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=727.48s)]
*  that [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=731.32s)]
*  Showed and so I think that inspired me to want to be a mom and so [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=732.2s)]
*  Yeah, fast forward being a mom. It's such a joy in my life [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=738.36s)]
*  And I always thought I would have three but here we are. We have four how that happened. It just happened [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=741.96s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy like we got married and you know [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=749.08s)]
*  Wait five years before we have children and then like about a year and a half later. I got pregnant. I'm like, okay, let's go [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=752.6s)]
*  Even though I felt scared at that time like I think god's timing was perfect and I loved [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=759.96s)]
*  Just basically bringing our little guy into our life and taking him along for the ride [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=767.16s)]
*  I was in a unique season in that I kind of quit competing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  And thankfully I did because that's when I met my husband [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=778.36s)]
*  And then we got married and he was like hey [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=781.96s)]
*  What else do you want to do in surf because it's not like that's something you can do forever [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=784.04s)]
*  So let's just like do a little more surfing and you can like check off all your goals and your dreams in surf [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=788.36s)]
*  So we started traveling and filming my documentary unstoppable and then I get pregnant. I'm like, oh my gosh [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=795.56s)]
*  Like I felt like my world was flipped upside down [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=801.64s)]
*  But I just ended up we brought our little tobias along for the ride with us [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=804.44s)]
*  And I had some of my greatest success in surfing in that season after having my first child [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=809.0799999999999s)]
*  um, and I've [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=816.28s)]
*  Finished my documentary and then then you brought him with you [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=818.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=822.12s)]
*  So my one-year-old had like more passport stamps than like your average human and we did I remember this one flight [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=822.5999999999999s)]
*  It was 13 hours [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=829.88s)]
*  across the world to the Maldives and we did some shooting down there and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=831.88s)]
*  And then i'm like nursing him and about to paddle out for my heat in fiji competing and [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=837.24s)]
*  We just made it work. You know most young parents [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=843.48s)]
*  You know, I include myself in this find it really hard to travel with little kids [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=847.88s)]
*  Oh my gosh, like having babies on an airplane is not easy. And so [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=851.4s)]
*  But we kind of just figured out how to make it work [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=857.56s)]
*  And I think because we immersed into that early on you get your little tricks on the on the road and [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=861.0s)]
*  You just become more adaptable. I think like I think routine's so good for children [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=867.24s)]
*  But we definitely had a lot of routine disrupt and we just had to like create our own routine on the road [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=872.2800000000001s)]
*  and [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=879.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was really a lot of fun. I like look back on that season [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=880.44s)]
*  And I mean my season hasn't changed that much [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=883.96s)]
*  We still travel quite a bit with all of our four four little well i've noticed that they're all here here on the other side [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=887.0799999999999s)]
*  Of the world from where you live and you brought all of your children and they're young [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=892.76s)]
*  Your little one's one. Yep. My little one's one and then I got a three-year-old six-year-old and nine-year-old [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=897.4s)]
*  It's it's interesting that you do that. What did you decide that you were just gonna stay a unit wherever you went? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=905.4s)]
*  Yes, I think we realized that we [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=912.4399999999999s)]
*  were [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=916.1999999999999s)]
*  Just still traveling a lot and we actually were trying to create a business. Um that would [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=917.2399999999999s)]
*  Be sustainable within hawaii and we actually ran into some business trouble. So [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=924.1199999999999s)]
*  We had to like reconfigure how we did did everything and it just ended up being that traveling for work [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=930.04s)]
*  I do a lot of motivational speaking which I absolutely love doing that [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=936.1199999999999s)]
*  I love being able to be an encouragement and inspire people but [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=939.64s)]
*  Obviously traveling with a family of six is not ideal [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=944.04s)]
*  Yeah, but I like the last thing I want to do is leave them home. Like I would have inner angst and [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=948.1999999999999s)]
*  um, I just wouldn't [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=955.48s)]
*  I know that it wouldn't work for me [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=957.88s)]
*  Like I would lose my mind and I know that my greatest god-given role is to be a mother [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=960.12s)]
*  And if i'm neglecting that role like I won't be able to live at peace [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=966.4399999999999s)]
*  And so just bringing them along is the way we've done [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=970.92s)]
*  We're doing it right now and it's working and they're just blossoming as humans [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=973.8s)]
*  like it's really fun to see [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=978.8399999999999s)]
*  them growing in their own ways and um, yeah just being [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=980.8399999999999s)]
*  Being along for the ride. I mean they must get closer to each other. Oh, yeah [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=985.56s)]
*  Last night yesterday was rough. We were all super jet lag. We had done a red eye [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=990.6s)]
*  And i'm like at one point i'm like go outside like don't come back in until you're ready to be at peace [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=995.16s)]
*  So, you know, there's rough moments, but for the most part, um, they get along really well [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1001.7199999999999s)]
*  I love that and and you travel with your husband everywhere. Yes. So we're just family unit [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1006.5999999999999s)]
*  My husband and I teamwork everything so he's kind of like behind the scenes making things happen [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1011.9599999999999s)]
*  and then i'm [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  showing up and doing a lot of like what we do and so [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1019.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's really a unique life and [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1025.0800000000002s)]
*  I love doing it though with my husband and it's just like we're the ultimate team [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1029.48s)]
*  and then the littles are like our little [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1035.4s)]
*  Minions along for the ride [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1038.8400000000001s)]
*  It's just a completely different model of living [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1041.3200000000002s)]
*  from the one that most americans certainly I grew up with where [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1044.76s)]
*  You know the father or both parents sort of [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1049.24s)]
*  Head out, you know in the morning to their own totally separate spheres of work [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1052.1200000000001s)]
*  And then the kids go out to school their separate spheres and then possibly they all meet together for a meal at night [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1057.8s)]
*  And then they go to bed [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1063.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely different and [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1065.24s)]
*  I think what made me more open to this life that we've chosen to live [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1068.44s)]
*  Was I homeschooled from seventh grade on? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1074.92s)]
*  And we grew up being homeschooled. Yeah, I grew up being homeschooled myself [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1077.8s)]
*  So my mom kept me home from seventh grade on I did elementary school and then I stayed home after that [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1081.6399999999999s)]
*  And it was primarily like there was a few different reasons. Our local public school was super bad [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1087.72s)]
*  We couldn't afford private and I was also like really highly competitive. I was already starting to travel for surf and so [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1092.6s)]
*  My parents decided to keep me home [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1100.9199999999998s)]
*  And save that drive time to our school is really far away. It's like 45 minute drive hour [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1103.48s)]
*  hour [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1109.64s)]
*  One way so two hours just driving to school. And so we just decided to stay home [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1111.0800000000002s)]
*  and [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1117.24s)]
*  My parents just kind of let me run with things [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1118.44s)]
*  And then I started surfing with one arm and even competing with one arm and that started [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1120.8400000000001s)]
*  less than a year later after losing my arm and so [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1127.24s)]
*  Two summers later, I won a national title and then I started competing [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1130.2s)]
*  In the world qualifying series. So just like the biggest league in surf to be a professional [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1135.0s)]
*  And so I started traveling international around 16 17 18. I'm like traveling around the world already [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1142.1200000000001s)]
*  So just being able to finish school while i'm traveling and have that flexibility was really just made it possible [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1150.04s)]
*  Just made it possible [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1158.52s)]
*  You know some of my peers did finish normal school and then they started competing so there's different ways about it [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1160.36s)]
*  Either way, you can be highly competitive. You just have to work with what you got, you know [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1167.1599999999999s)]
*  but I feel like traveling and surfing taught me more than [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1171.8799999999999s)]
*  you know school [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1176.52s)]
*  did and so [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1178.4399999999998s)]
*  It just made me a savvier human. It made me like understand the world more, you know [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1180.76s)]
*  I saw a lot of different cultures and you know, I had to build my own independence really young [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1185.56s)]
*  and it just [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1192.76s)]
*  You know, I blossomed a little younger. I would say than most people [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1194.6s)]
*  I haven't always been proud of the companies that have advertised on shows i've had over the years [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1199.08s)]
*  But now that we have our own company we decided well [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1202.6799999999998s)]
*  We're only going to take ads from people we like and agree with and admire so it is with actual pride that we announce [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1205.24s)]
*  Partnership with bass pro shops, you know bass pro shops [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1212.2800000000002s)]

*  What you might not know is if for over 50 years bass pro has been a leader in conservation efforts throughout the continent [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1222.1200000000001s)]
*  Bass pro is led by our friend. Johnny morris. He's the visionary founder visionary is not too strong [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1229.3200000000002s)]
*  By the way of that company and he's put conservation at the core of their mission from the very first day [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1234.1200000000001s)]
*  And by conservation we're not talking about some weird theoretical climate scheme [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1239.48s)]
*  We're talking about preserving the natural landscape [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1243.72s)]
*  Preserving the land the natural resources that we inherited created by god [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1248.1999999999998s)]
*  So for the last decade bass pro is average giving back more than 10 percent of their earnings to conservation [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1253.0s)]
*  And advancing their mission a critical mission of introducing people to the outdoors getting them away from screens into [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1258.36s)]
*  god's great nature [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1265.6399999999999s)]
*  Advocating for the rights of sportsmen and conserving wildlife and habitat, which is essential you hunter fish, you know [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1267.64s)]
*  So customers are invited to round up their purchases in store and online to support bass pro shops and cabela's outdoor fund [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1275.0800000000002s)]
*  Which gets invested directly with conservation projects and organizations in the communities they serve. It's all real [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1282.8400000000001s)]
*  So rounding up that little bit of pocket change adds up over time particularly with a big company like bass pro [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1289.3200000000002s)]
*  And it makes a big difference [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1294.68s)]
*  So stop into your nearest bass pro shops or cabela's to gear up for all your outdoor pursuits hunting fishing being outside [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1296.28s)]
*  And while you're there, we recommend rounding up for conservation. What did you I mean? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1302.84s)]
*  What'd that do to your relationship with your mom? Did you get along with her when she was homeschooling? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1307.24s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think like most teenagers we got along but there was like a little sandpaper too [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1312.04s)]
*  Yeah, she did the best she could and in hindsight I look back and i'm like, you know [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1318.36s)]
*  I had some teenage vibes going on but [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1323.0s)]
*  For the most part like yeah [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1325.64s)]
*  I think for the most part we had a really awesome relationship and my parents would take turns traveling with me. So [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1328.12s)]
*  You know, we lived in hawaii price of living is really high and they're just barely scraping by but they still gave me [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1335.88s)]
*  So much to support and you lived on an outer island. Yeah, we lived on the outer island too [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1343.0s)]
*  So we're always in our island hopping and then once we started traveling more internationally [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1347.24s)]
*  It was just a lot on them. But [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1351.98s)]
*  Thankfully like I was surfing so well and I had I started supporting myself around age 16 [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1354.0400000000002s)]
*  Financially, so I was traveling [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1361.88s)]
*  Under my own dollar at that point [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1364.3000000000002s)]
*  but my parents would come along for the ride with me sometimes and I think sometimes they're pitching in but [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1366.38s)]
*  uh [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1372.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I just kind of started young for me. What a different childhood [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1374.14s)]
*  Yes, very different and I think too being a professional athlete [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1378.0600000000002s)]
*  you learn [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1382.46s)]
*  Diligence and ownership over your life. You have to push yourself. You have to be self-motivated you have to [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1384.52s)]
*  You know really work hard at your sport and nobody else is going to do it for you [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1391.74s)]
*  And so I learned that really young and that has served me in so many different ways [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1397.02s)]
*  Throughout my life. Are you going to homeschool your children? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1402.94s)]
*  Yeah, so we're in the early stage of homeschooling and it's a beast [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1406.22s)]
*  Is it I think it is but I also think we make it more of a beast than we need to be and [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1411.4199999999998s)]
*  Can you just I mean think a lot of people? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1418.22s)]
*  Um, well certainly my age whose kids are grown, you know sort of think well [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1421.74s)]
*  Probably should have done that didn't even really think about it should have done it [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1425.4199999999998s)]
*  but now with [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1428.9399999999998s)]
*  You know the sort of obvious evil going on in government schools and private schools [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1430.46s)]
*  I think a lot of people would like to homeschool. I mean, but how hard is it? What is it? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1436.5400000000002s)]
*  What is it exactly? The rate of homeschool is grown by like millions and millions of more [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1441.8200000000002s)]
*  Americans homeschooling and so what's really cool is there is a lot of resources and tools and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1447.72s)]
*  information to make it more possible [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1454.2s)]
*  And I think a lot of people get overwhelmed at the thought of homeschool because you think of traditional school, which is [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1457.2600000000002s)]
*  seven hours a day [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1463.8200000000002s)]
*  But a lot of that time is wasted time that isn't actually learning or educating [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1465.98s)]
*  and so [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1472.38s)]
*  taking the model and changing it to be less than two hours a day and [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1473.9s)]
*  Chances are they're learning more than they would [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1480.5400000000002s)]
*  In a school day plus there wait less than two hours a day [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1483.66s)]
*  Yes [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1487.82s)]
*  Yeah, you don't need a whole lot of time to accomplish [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1488.54s)]
*  a lot of your educating [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1492.1399999999999s)]
*  in each day [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1494.78s)]
*  And so then why are we sending? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1496.3799999999999s)]
*  Kids to school all day. I I mean that's a big question, right? Yeah, it is [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1499.42s)]
*  You know, I [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1508.06s)]
*  I think it's primarily the financial system you you bring it back to the financial system [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1509.18s)]
*  And it is a lot harder to survive on one income [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1515.3400000000001s)]
*  Now fast forward in this day and age. It's it's a you know [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1519.74s)]
*  My parents made it work in that my mom was working and so there was a little pass back and forth [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1524.22s)]
*  Or I would go stay with my friend if my mom was working a night shift [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1529.66s)]
*  and so I just remember like [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1534.22s)]
*  She just worked the restaurant industry both my parents were in the restaurant industry [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1536.94s)]
*  So they're very like simple life like not a high income just barely getting by but they did show that you can [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1541.82s)]
*  Homeschool on a lower income. Yes, and still do a whole lot. And so [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1548.76s)]
*  I think seeing them worked hard was really inspiring for me because I just saw them dedicate a lot to me [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1556.3s)]
*  but also work really hard and [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1562.3s)]
*  I think [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1564.6200000000001s)]
*  a lot of people are overwhelmed at the thought of homeschool because [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1566.06s)]
*  You know parenting in itself is pretty hard [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1570.3s)]
*  Yeah, it is. Um, but I wonder why it's become so hard for us like [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1573.58s)]
*  for me, I've had to unpack a lot of like my habits or [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1579.02s)]
*  You know things that I'm not necessarily proud of like, you know [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1583.3400000000001s)]
*  I had a season where I was really like short-tempered and like I had to work through some health things to [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1586.8600000000001s)]
*  Get on to the other side of that and like support myself to better mother my children [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1593.1s)]
*  And I look back on that season and I hate that version of myself like I mean i'm forgiving of her [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1598.06s)]
*  But i'm like, why was I like, how bad was she? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1604.06s)]
*  I was just like really like, you know, I think women tend to be more emotional and [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1607.58s)]
*  And they're hard on themselves. That's yeah, and [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1613.8999999999999s)]
*  I look back on that season and I realized that it was more than just [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1616.78s)]
*  Being a woman like I wasn't being supported nutritionally [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1621.18s)]
*  Like my sleep was really bad and like there was a few other things going on where I was like just high stress [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1625.26s)]
*  And I was very like easily angered and I had to really like work on my nutrition and my lifestyle habits [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1631.74s)]
*  Like I stopped watching tv [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1638.94s)]
*  At night like sometimes, you know [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1641.18s)]
*  I'd want to just like wind down and I stopped doing that and I would just focus on getting to bed sooner [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1643.18s)]
*  Making sure i'm eating enough in the day getting enough protein and carbs throughout the day [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1648.94s)]
*  And just making some health shifts that really like changed who I was like i'm way more patient now [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1654.46s)]
*  I'm way more like I can hold the needs of my children and their emotions because children are more [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1660.8600000000001s)]
*  Like they're not as emotionally stable and I really think that we help them stabilize by how we are [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1668.22s)]
*  You know and a lot of people are just struggling to remain calm when their child's having a full-blown tantrum [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1673.74s)]
*  It's like the parent is having a tantrum with the child. Yes, but we need to do the opposite [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1680.14s)]
*  We need to like hold steady while they're having their tantrum and like help them work through that [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1684.94s)]
*  And so yeah mothering has taught me a lot and has challenged me in ways that [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1690.7s)]
*  No other role in life has challenged me [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1696.86s)]
*  And but i'm so grateful for that because it's sharpened me it's made me [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1701.26s)]
*  You know really have to dig deeper and like work through my issues and work through my challenges that [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1706.14s)]
*  Where some some of them were probably learned too like [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1712.6200000000001s)]
*  My mom's my parents are amazing, but I still like had some learned habits that weren't great that I needed to like unlearn and like [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1716.3s)]
*  Reform and currently still working through some of them, but you know for the most part I can look back on this season that [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1723.9s)]
*  Wasn't so good and i'm so grateful that I was willing to adapt and challenge myself and look for help and [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1731.1000000000001s)]
*  educate myself and dive into health and like be an advocate for myself because [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1737.8200000000002s)]
*  At the end of the day nobody else was going to do that for me [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1743.5s)]
*  And fast forward even to like the new season [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1747.74s)]
*  And fast forward even to like the influence I have on my household and like helping my husband to be healthy and helping him to [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1750.46s)]
*  Take ownership in that area as like the leader of our household [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1760.22s)]
*  and now i'm like [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1764.94s)]
*  Just the alignment that we have as a family as a married couple [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1767.18s)]
*  Like continually working through the different little challenges along the way [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1771.9s)]
*  we're a unit and [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1776.46s)]
*  As him and and I as the like leaders [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1779.18s)]
*  We're leading our children and I think that [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1782.78s)]
*  You know, we looked through some of the challenges we've had along the way [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1786.38s)]
*  And our children are watching this and we're literally their role models and we're shaping this next generation [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1790.94s)]
*  And so there's a lot of weight that comes with that and I feel like society has let go of that in a sense of like [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1800.06s)]
*  We're just we're going to school and we're going to sports and we're just trying to get by [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1806.94s)]
*  And there's lack of intentionality in the household [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1813.58s)]
*  And so I think I have a heart to not only work with teenagers specifically in america and help them to think through their future better [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1817.34s)]
*  But now like seeing the influence that you know, the family has in society. It's so important [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1826.38s)]
*  And so going back to like the foundation of the family husband and wife and what does that relationship look like and how can you [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1833.98s)]
*  You know work through your challenges together and overcome together so that you grow closer together as you go through life rather than growing apart [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1842.22s)]
*  and um [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1850.54s)]
*  Yeah, just seeing the way society is now and like the talk on the family and the talk on young people and their [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1852.78s)]
*  Um [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1860.14s)]
*  Their gender so to say and like the way social media has a role in society [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1862.7s)]
*  There's a lot that's not good and that we have to like think through and be intentional about and [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1867.02s)]
*  So yeah, you say there's a you said there's a lack of [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1873.9s)]
*  Of intentional behavior intentionality in the household. What do you mean? I feel like [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1877.48s)]
*  kind of like what [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1883.98s)]
*  I would want to word it is [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1886.7s)]
*  Maybe it's just a passiveness [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1889.26s)]
*  Like we're just kind of being passive about things and we're letting things happen versus like choosing how we [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1890.8600000000001s)]
*  See things happen in the household [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1898.78s)]
*  We're just being passive and letting our children grow up letting them see and learn whatever they can learn out in society [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1901.18s)]
*  You know children are given [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1908.3s)]
*  iPads and iphones super young and they're instantly being like told a lot of different compelling [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1910.38s)]
*  Things that aren't necessarily filled with truth and so [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1917.92s)]
*  I think [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1923.3600000000001s)]
*  As a role as a mom and you know, my husband as a father [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1924.56s)]
*  um, you know, we're thinking through that because our children are still young, but our nine-year-old is going to be a teenager and [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1929.68s)]
*  You know a few years and like life's gonna change and so how can we be proactive and [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1936.16s)]
*  And [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1942.8s)]
*  not just be passive in his life, but really like mentor him and speak into his life and [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1944.08s)]
*  You know help him find his career path so to say and help him to become a brave and [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1950.08s)]
*  Leading young man, even if his nature isn't necessarily a leader actually [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1957.2s)]
*  Our eldest is a natural leader [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1961.84s)]
*  But i'm just saying like we'll look at our other boys and maybe they won't be natural-born leaders [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1964.0s)]
*  But they're gonna have to lead at some point and so equipping them to lead and like [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1968.64s)]
*  Showing them the way more than just by example, but really like coming alongside of them and helping them find their way [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1973.76s)]
*  Until they truly are ready to spread their wings and then letting them know that the phone is always there and like the arms are always [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1981.68s)]
*  open so [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1989.1200000000001s)]
*  So you said that um of your you've got three boys and one daughter your oldest son is a natural leader [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1991.2s)]
*  He's the oldest not surprised [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=1997.68s)]
*  But that all your boys are gonna have to be leaders. What did what did you mean? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2000.0800000000002s)]
*  And how would you train them to be leaders? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2003.44s)]
*  yeah, you know, I just think of [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2006.0s)]
*  the god-given beauty of [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2009.28s)]
*  marriage and matrimony and [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2012.16s)]
*  That relationship and when done right like the man is meant to be the leader. Yes [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2015.2s)]
*  and I feel [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2022.72s)]
*  I think that [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2024.48s)]
*  in society [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2025.92s)]
*  You know with the current culture, especially in america [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2028.1599999999999s)]
*  a lot of that's been flipped upside down and [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2031.6799999999998s)]
*  disregarded and [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2035.26s)]
*  It's not serving society. And how is that working flipping that upside down? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2037.28s)]
*  like just the woman is maybe maybe she's not overtly [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2042.32s)]
*  leading the household, but maybe she's manipulating the household or [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2047.52s)]
*  Maybe she's living in the same household but doing her own thing and it's just kind of like two separate lives together [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2052.5600000000004s)]
*  But like she's doing her own thing and not really necessarily following a lead or maybe it's simply that the husband isn't leading [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2059.76s)]
*  And he's being passive. Yes, and that is affecting the household in ways that maybe the husband and wife don't really [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2066.32s)]
*  realize and [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2074.78s)]
*  it's harmful and [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2076.96s)]
*  It doesn't serve the household and it's hard to recognize it at first but at some point it will backfire [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2079.68s)]
*  And I think that's partially why there's so many broken marriages now [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2087.28s)]
*  But there's so much we could impact there [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2093.28s)]
*  right, there's so much to society that [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2095.76s)]
*  is broken and lacking wholeness [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2098.96s)]
*  and you know, maybe the husband isn't being faithful or [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2102.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe the wife is being [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2107.12s)]
*  You know reacting in a way that's pushing him away and there's just so much to unpack [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2109.92s)]
*  You know, i'm not like a marriage expert and you know, I don't think you've identified the big ones though. Yeah [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2114.8s)]
*  Actually, it sounds like you are a marriage expert because you've just described [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2120.48s)]
*  The many varieties of dysfunction in a household and the passive husband [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2124.2400000000002s)]
*  Is a much more common thing than it used to be [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2129.28s)]
*  Yeah, and it's hard because a lot of like what we know is what we've been taught or what we've [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2131.2s)]
*  You know learned from our own parents and so you could hardly blame the husband for for being that way [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2137.3599999999997s)]
*  They maybe never had someone come alongside of them and truly show them the way in a healthy way [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2145.12s)]
*  And or simply having conversations that are intentional around this area [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2150.8799999999997s)]
*  Like hey, like these are things you're going to need to do as like the leader of your household [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2155.6s)]
*  Like just simple conversations that are never held if you were to give that advice to one of your boys, what would you say? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2159.76s)]
*  Oh [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2166.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean from a mother's perspective is just knowing that like hey like you need to provide for your wife [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2167.1200000000003s)]
*  mentally emotionally and physically [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2174.48s)]
*  And what that looks like is this this this and this and if she's reacting in certain ways [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2177.0400000000004s)]
*  It's likely that you're not providing in one of those [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2182.7200000000003s)]
*  Key points and so being willing to problem solve as like a husband [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2185.52s)]
*  and you know to be honest like it's because i've felt this in my own marriage and [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2190.8s)]
*  Having to work through that with my husband and rather than like letting the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2197.12s)]
*  The [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2204.56s)]
*  Rather than letting like the darkness tear us apart and pull us apart like [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2206.16s)]
*  Our faith has grown us closer to our husband [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2210.72s)]
*  Our faith has grown us closer. We've had to work through some of our issues and [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2213.84s)]
*  Just seeing him grow as the leader of our household has been really beautiful and [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2219.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm just so grateful, but I felt like the before and after so are you saying maybe make it more general? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2225.84s)]
*  So, yeah, I definitely make it more general, but you know what you're talking about [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2232.32s)]
*  Do you think that um a woman should encourage explicitly encourage her husband to be a leader a better leader? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2236.88s)]
*  I think I mean, yes for sure [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2243.52s)]
*  We should be encouraging like that is our role is to be encouraging and cheer on and support and [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2245.44s)]
*  You know be supportive [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2252.6400000000003s)]
*  But also to allow that to happen and sometimes you have to let go of things too [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2256.7200000000003s)]
*  but I also like there's a lot of conversation that comes with that and like talking about it and working through it and [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2263.6800000000003s)]
*  And um, it's it's hard because this is such like a deep deep issue [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2269.84s)]
*  and [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2276.2400000000002s)]
*  But it's the core issue [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2277.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and if a husband and wife can't get along then how does society continue? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2278.6400000000003s)]
*  No for sure and that's why I talked like when I started opened up this little can of worms. I was like [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2283.04s)]
*  Talking about it from the perspective of like society. Why is there so much brokenness in society? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2289.6800000000003s)]
*  We've lost our problem solving abilities and instead of like [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2295.8399999999997s)]
*  You know having those deep meaningful conversations that are essential over time not having those conversations [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2300.3199999999997s)]
*  Then they just break apart. Okay, so let's be specific. You've got four kids. I have four kids [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2309.12s)]
*  So I know I know what it's like to have, you know [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2314.48s)]
*  Nine through one [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2317.12s)]
*  And what it really is is just kind of chaotic [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2318.64s)]
*  There's just a lot going on a lot of people with immediate needs that must be met [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2321.2s)]
*  A lot of filth that must be cleaned, etc. Etc a lot of noise [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2325.68s)]
*  Hard to have conversations with your spouse under those circumstances. We are living it. So how do you [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2329.68s)]
*  Have a conversation like that's that heavy and that important when you've got all these other demands [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2336.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's super hard and that's why like I talked I always bring up my health journey [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2343.52s)]
*  Um, it's not like I went super deep in on that but realizing that I needed the energy [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2348.72s)]
*  You know throughout the whole day not half of the day the whole day until I make it to my bed at bedtime [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2354.8s)]
*  Yeah, I need the energy to serve my family well [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2360.7200000000003s)]
*  and so i'm very passionate about health because [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2364.0s)]
*  I recognize that like the common meme is like but first coffee but first like [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2367.36s)]
*  I need some me time to like survive this chaos [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2372.88s)]
*  But we're really not as resilient as we should be because our health isn't being supported in the way that it needs to be [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2376.6400000000003s)]
*  To be the best mother to be the best [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2382.7200000000003s)]
*  wife to be the best daughter, um in life and so [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2386.1600000000003s)]
*  first supporting yourself so that you can um [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2390.88s)]
*  Overcome the hardship that comes your way [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2395.28s)]
*  and so for me like [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2398.4s)]
*  You know, i'm not watching netflix or tv or anything at bedtime [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2400.8s)]
*  I'm going to bed or i'm having a conversation with my husband [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2406.0s)]
*  So it's like the relationship and my health first before any entertainment [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2410.7200000000003s)]
*  and trying to feel like just to [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2416.4s)]
*  Pause on this for a second because I think it's a it's a big thing particularly for busy people people with little kids. It's like [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2419.36s)]
*  All right, the second they go to bed. I'm just going to zone out in my own world with netflix or whatever [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2424.96s)]
*  Why why is that bad? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2430.2400000000002s)]
*  well [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2432.32s)]
*  You know, why did you stop doing it? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2433.84s)]
*  I stopped because I felt like I needed to stop for my own like survival [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2436.32s)]
*  survival like [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2442.88s)]
*  like [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2444.4s)]
*  You know, I do try to find, you know a 20 30 minute sometimes hour and a half window for myself in the day [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2445.52s)]
*  Which that looks like surfing or getting a little movement or going on a walk or laying in my bed praying or doing something [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2452.88s)]
*  Just by myself for a quick minute [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2460.4s)]
*  But there's like so much time that is wasted whether it's scrolling on social media or watching tv [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2463.28s)]
*  It's a very consumeristic [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2470.7200000000003s)]
*  and I want to create and I want to [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2473.28s)]
*  build and [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2478.32s)]
*  Um make beautiful [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2480.1600000000003s)]
*  And to me consuming doesn't allow for that as much, you know when i'm consuming [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2482.2400000000002s)]
*  i'm [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2488.56s)]
*  essentially not creating [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2489.44s)]
*  And so I knew it would be worth asking you that question because that's a wonderful answer when i'm consuming i'm not creating [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2491.68s)]
*  Yes, and so for me, you know, we always want to justify our actions. Um [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2497.76s)]
*  Every now and then I like to sit down and watch alone and it's usually with my husband and sometimes with my children [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2504.32s)]
*  Like that's the one tv show we watch lately [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2510.48s)]
*  in the last year [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2513.12s)]
*  But otherwise i'm not consuming and you know, I am on social media [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2514.7200000000003s)]
*  But I try to like keep tabs on that and not let it like overtake my life. I have it [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2518.88s)]
*  Typically have it on a separate device. Um lately I haven't because I broke my old device phone [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2523.92s)]
*  But I I had to move it off my main phone device [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2529.52s)]
*  Because I was like needed to control that time so to say spent like not [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2533.52s)]
*  randomly scrolling when I didn't necessarily want to [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2538.8s)]
*  You know kind of putting some boundaries there because yeah [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2542.48s)]
*  It became like a easy reflex to like kill time and space [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2545.8399999999997s)]
*  And so I I moved it to a separate device and that was a game changer for me [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2550.72s)]
*  I know not everyone can just have a separate extra device [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2555.44s)]
*  But if you can and if it is stealing that much of your time [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2558.3199999999997s)]
*  Then maybe it's worth investing that extra little chunk if you aren't willing to give it up [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2562.16s)]
*  um [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2567.9199999999996s)]
*  but [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2569.6s)]
*  Yeah, anyway [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2570.96s)]
*  So if you're old enough to remember when the internet started you remember the promises that accompanied it this was going to make [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2572.24s)]
*  Everything easier. This was going to spark innovation and this was above all going to bring freedom to the world [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2577.7599999999998s)]
*  So back when using a search engine wasn't some big tech mind control operation. That was true [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2585.2799999999997s)]
*  You'd have to take out your credit card every time you wanted to read a newspaper or you weren't bombarded by pop-ups and cheap foreign ads [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2592.08s)]
*  of some kind [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2598.64s)]
*  Those days are long gone. Unfortunately [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2600.08s)]
*  Many of us go online knowing the truth. You're being watched. You're being recorded. You're being tracked. You're being manipulated at all times [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2602.24s)]
*  It's depressing as hell, but you can't get around it because you need the internet to live [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2609.2s)]
*  Right now your internet service provider can probably see your entire browsing history. It's none of their business, but they can see it [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2613.68s)]
*  And thanks to our public servants in the u.s congress [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2620.7999999999997s)]
*  They can even sell that public information to the highest bidder your private information being sold and by the way [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2623.6s)]
*  Governments can buy it and they do [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2630.0s)]
*  And who knows what they plan to do with that information big tech companies or governments our own or foreign governments [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2632.8799999999997s)]
*  That's all bad. And that's why here at tcn we get around it. We avoid it. We protect ourselves from it with express vpn [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2638.72s)]
*  Express vpn is a virtual private network that reroutes 100 of our online activity [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2646.56s)]
*  Through secure encrypted servers and that shields what we're doing online from the prying eyes [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2651.6s)]
*  Eyes of our internet service provider and third parties big companies and governments [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2657.7599999999998s)]
*  Because we believe in privacy because it's a prerequisite for freedom [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2662.96s)]
*  Express vpn hides our ip address [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2666.3199999999997s)]
*  That's the number that can personally identify you on the internet and that means that data brokers cannot track us [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2668.3999999999996s)]
*  It's simple. It takes one tap to connect and express vpn works on every device. You've got your phone tablet television desktop [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2675.12s)]
*  You can even have express vpn up to eight devices at once running on all of them and that's more than enough to protect [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2683.94s)]
*  everybody in your household [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2690.5s)]
*  So if you want online privacy back and who wouldn't want that? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2692.5s)]
*  Or cheap get express vpn. You can use our special link to get three extra months of express vpn for free [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2697.06s)]

*  Slash tucker express expr. Ess [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2706.6600000000003s)]
*  vpn.com [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2710.1600000000003s)]
*  So it sounds like you're when you said households are not intentional in the way that they make decisions live [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2712.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost like we're more reactive to life rather than proactive [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2720.7999999999997s)]
*  so reacting to what comes our way and just kind of reacting to the time and [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2725.12s)]
*  Just doing what we have to do to kind of get by [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2730.3999999999996s)]
*  Versus like planning and being proactive and saying no to certain things and saying [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2733.12s)]
*  You know like choosing what comes in the household and how we use our time and how we converse with one another and [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2738.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, I think of like the marriage is the foundation of the household and so being proactive in that relationship and like really working [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2746.5600000000004s)]
*  for that rather than letting time kind of [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2754.4s)]
*  Turn it into this passive relationship that eventually fizzles out because we weren't proactive in it and so [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2759.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be fun if adam was here. He could speak to that in his own [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2767.6s)]
*  Sense and I i'm grateful to god for him every single day [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2772.3999999999996s)]
*  and we've had our own journey of like growing and learning and [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2776.64s)]
*  Becoming more proactive and like working through our challenges [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2781.3599999999997s)]
*  one thing i'm struck by is you [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2786.24s)]
*  You're you keep coming back to time how you spend time? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2788.48s)]
*  And when you said that homeschooling can be done a child can be educated to at least the standard of a public school in two hours [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2791.84s)]
*  And then you said but for most parents just like send your kids to school take them to sports [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2800.0s)]
*  There's like a whole kind of program that families sign up for that [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2804.2400000000002s)]
*  They have no control over at all that may or may not be good for their children and they just react to it [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2808.1600000000003s)]
*  But you're instead figuring out how to spend, you know the other 22 hours of the day with your kids [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2813.76s)]
*  That's that's a big change from the way most people live. Yeah, it is a big change and I [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2820.0s)]
*  I think it's because [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2826.4s)]
*  You know [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2829.3599999999997s)]
*  I was like the last generation [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2831.2s)]
*  To not have social media for most of my childhood [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2833.8399999999997s)]
*  So I remember I got an instagram about when I was 15 and I had this season where I was highly addicted to it [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2838.4s)]
*  I would be with all my friends and I would like randomly start scrolling and then I would try to show them stuff and they're like [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2845.68s)]
*  We're having fun together. Like we don't need that [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2852.08s)]
*  And so I was this last generation to like I grew up [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2855.2s)]
*  diving into the ocean and swimming with turtles and going surfing and playing kick the can in the yard and [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2859.52s)]
*  Filming little movies on a camcorder [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2867.68s)]
*  That were like gory and we put ketchup on my left arm and like we were truly children like [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2870.48s)]
*  Filming horror movies in our backyard because it was hilarious and funny and like just being really creative [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2876.48s)]
*  And now I look at this generation and you'll be driving and you'll see kids on the side of the road hunched over looking at devices [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2882.3199999999997s)]
*  waiting for their school bus like [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2889.6s)]
*  Not full of life like not full of joy and beauty and [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2892.8799999999997s)]
*  Passion and creativity but rather being [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2897.9s)]
*  Sent into this society realm that is [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2902.7200000000003s)]
*  just [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2907.6800000000003s)]
*  Passive it's uh being entertained. It's being consumeristic [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2908.96s)]
*  it's just [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2914.8s)]
*  Lacking this beauty in life that I really like I look back on my childhood and I love my childhood [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2916.32s)]
*  You know, I did grow up with amazing parents that you know, they they devoted a lot of time [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2923.84s)]
*  Because you're famous for being attacked by a shark and losing your arm in your childhood. And yeah [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2929.84s)]
*  How was your childhood the best? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2935.92s)]
*  It was well, that's just [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2938.32s)]
*  Yeah, it was so amazing [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2940.88s)]
*  And you know the the loss of the arm was just like a little speed bump in the road [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2942.88s)]
*  Like I continued to have like an amazing childhood after I lost my arm [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2948.24s)]
*  And so now i'm looking at this generation. It feels like you really mean that yeah, I do mean that I loved my childhood [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2952.48s)]
*  even the the hardship that I faced like [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2958.72s)]
*  It created me to be an overcomer to be an adapter to be someone who? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2961.84s)]
*  Has to work through a challenge in a healthy way and I did figure that out [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2967.36s)]
*  I would say for the most part, you know, there's always things we have to unpack at some point or another but [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2971.36s)]
*  Yeah, and now being fast forward being a mom and i'm like looking at this generation and it's just so vastly different [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2977.12s)]
*  I will say like I did watch my I would leave my house at like eight in the morning to go surf [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2984.16s)]
*  My brothers were gamers [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2990.8799999999997s)]
*  So I would leave the house and like go do a bunch of different things and then I'd come back like eight hours later [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2993.04s)]
*  And like my brothers hadn't left their spot on the couch [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=2998.3199999999997s)]
*  And that also had a huge impact on me I was like, what are you guys doing? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3002.24s)]
*  You literally haven't left the couch for like eight hours straight [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3006.48s)]
*  and I hated seeing that I think being like a nature lover and someone who like grew up in nature and like [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3011.04s)]
*  Found my creativity in waves granted both my brothers were great [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3017.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh ocean men as well. They were like really talented on waves [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3022.3199999999997s)]
*  So it wasn't like they were so stuck to the gaming that they didn't go surf [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3025.2799999999997s)]
*  But I saw this like side that I just didn't like and I was like [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3029.6s)]
*  there's no way i'm allowing that in my household as I grew up or as i'm raising my children because I want them to be creating and [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3033.44s)]
*  um [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3042.08s)]
*  You know, I want them to just be super healthy. I think too like I have like a unique perspective of like [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3043.12s)]
*  being an uh [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3049.7599999999998s)]
*  former professional athlete really having to push it physically and mentally and like knowing that I had to support that [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3050.88s)]
*  Nutritionally and [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3058.8599999999997s)]
*  Just through various avenues of health I now bring that into my household and i'm like if there's one area in your life [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3060.64s)]
*  As a parent to not be passive. It's like well actually I don't think I can narrow it down to one thing [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3067.4399999999996s)]
*  But it's like your faith [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3072.56s)]
*  and health [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3075.04s)]
*  Like at least give your children those two things because otherwise society will eat them up [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3076.3199999999997s)]
*  And there's so much junk out there that will like okay. Well, let's [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3082.24s)]
*  I'm first of all, I feel like a consumer slug listening to you [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3086.3199999999997s)]
*  I've never played a video game, but I have wasted a lot of my life now that i'm thinking and I think of it [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3090.72s)]
*  I'm sorry that I have [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3095.8399999999997s)]
*  But let's just stop with those two things you the two things you said you can give a child [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3097.2799999999997s)]
*  Or four children or faith and health [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3102.4s)]
*  So let's just start with faith. How do you do that? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3105.92s)]
*  Well, I guess you have to go on the journey yourself [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3108.4s)]
*  um first [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3112.88s)]
*  You have to be able to know what you believe. Um, you know my parents [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3115.04s)]
*  encouraged me to know god at a young age, um in the christian faith and [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3119.36s)]
*  I mentioned earlier after I lost my arm [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3125.04s)]
*  I had a piece that I believe only god could have brought like through that season [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3127.44s)]
*  Even though it felt chaotic and upside down and like the most unimaginable [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3132.24s)]
*  Happened to me [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3137.84s)]
*  and i'm a very rare human to have that [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3139.36s)]
*  circumstance but [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3142.38s)]
*  Even in the chaos I had a sense of peace that god was with me and he was not going to leave my side [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3144.0s)]
*  And I don't think that he ever did like the way I worked through that season was so beautiful and so [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3148.96s)]
*  full of a confidence that I believe only god could have brought and [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3156.16s)]
*  I'm thankful that you know, my mom and dad weren't perfect [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3161.84s)]
*  But they were there for me and my mom would read the psalms and proverbs in particular because it's very inviting [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3165.12s)]
*  I like the proverbs because it unpacks the wisdom of god [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3170.8s)]
*  Like there's 31 proverbs y'all could read one proverbs a day and it would be less than five minutes of your day [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3175.36s)]
*  Could you take five minutes of your day to like read god's word? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3182.2400000000002s)]
*  I think so and they're amazing and they even if you don't believe in god an atheist could read the proverbs [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3186.48s)]
*  And come away improved. Yes be blessed by the proverbs [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3192.96s)]
*  But the proverbs and psalms was like one thing that my mom did read with me [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3196.72s)]
*  She would read that and pray with me at bedtime [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3200.8799999999997s)]
*  And that was such a blessing and I think that helped sprout my own faith my own childlike faith that eventually grew into its own as I [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3203.52s)]
*  Grew into an adult and now I want to give my children that so that if they have [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3212.08s)]
*  Something like a shark attack in their life. They're gonna be able to work through that with or without mama like [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3217.8399999999997s)]
*  They'll be able to survive the challenges of this world [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3224.7999999999997s)]
*  They'll be able to see through the lies that are being spoken on a daily basis in our society [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3227.6s)]
*  They'll be able to see through [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3234.7999999999997s)]
*  The lies that aren't going to serve them in their life [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3236.96s)]
*  and I believe that that's in god's word first and foremost and so [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3240.56s)]
*  For me, it looks like praying with my children at bedtime and throughout the day and [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3246.0s)]
*  It's reading the bible and it's encouraging them in their faith and talking through [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3251.68s)]
*  philosophical ideas that [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3256.78s)]
*  At the end of the day, you can look to god's word and know what is truth [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3259.6s)]
*  and so [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3264.64s)]
*  I forget your original question, but how do you oh, yeah. Yeah, how do you impart faith and health? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3266.48s)]
*  Yeah, and and then too just like praying for my children because at the end of the day [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3271.28s)]
*  It's not me who does their faith. It's god [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3275.44s)]
*  God will gift you that faith. He will speak into your life. And so to me the most important thing is to [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3278.8s)]
*  Read god's word because that is the thing that will [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3286.24s)]
*  sharpen them and speak into their life and it's ultimately [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3289.84s)]
*  The lord says that that is his word and when we hear his word that [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3294.08s)]
*  Can work and move in our hearts and minds and so [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3298.64s)]
*  and then when it comes to health like just [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3302.72s)]
*  Uh living out healthy healthy lifestyle teaching them what is good and what is not good [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3305.7599999999998s)]
*  My children know that like we're not eating red dye five because it's not good for us [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3311.44s)]
*  So they're choosing not to do that [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3315.7599999999998s)]
*  At six and nine already [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3318.56s)]
*  And they know like we still have treats so it's not like they're so deprived that like they're like [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3321.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh my gosh, I need the red dye five because I have this opportunity to have it [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3326.96s)]
*  The red dye five pardon my ignorance [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3330.8799999999997s)]
*  What's red dye five? You know the red dye that they put in food, but it's not really like food and it's like highly toxic [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3334.3199999999997s)]
*  You need a deep dive that tucker. Come on. Get your act together. I don't know if I want to know [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3341.04s)]
*  It sounds bad though. But like if you go into the grocery stores now like [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3346.24s)]
*  Majority of the grocery store is not even things we should be consuming and I know a lot of people are like well, that's expensive [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3351.6s)]
*  You know to a certain extent it is going to take a little more investment to bring real food into your house [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3360.8799999999997s)]
*  But when you educate yourselves and start to understand why [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3368.8799999999997s)]
*  It becomes an easier decision and there's a lot of things you can do [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3373.7599999999998s)]
*  That are more affordable to just eat real food. Basically, what do you serve your kids? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3378.48s)]
*  Um, and that's the cool thing is i'm the one with the wallet so I get to bring [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3384.88s)]
*  What is in the house my husband and I of course? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3390.2400000000002s)]
*  And he does half of the grocery shopping whoever just is out there picking up most money in every household is spent by the woman [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3393.04s)]
*  She makes those decisions. Yes. Yes [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3400.48s)]
*  So, you know, i'm the one that's choosing what comes into the house [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3402.8s)]
*  so it's easy to make the household healthy because [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3406.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not gonna buy the junk that doesn't serve them and their health in the long run [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3410.4s)]
*  um, so for example for breakfast we'll have crepes pancakes waffles or like [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3415.12s)]
*  Egg toast and i'm like blending it in the blender and i'm putting the ingredients in there [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3421.12s)]
*  And it's all wholesome ingredients and like lots of good eggs eggs are such a great way to start your day [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3426.24s)]
*  My children are fairly like mentally stable and I think it's because we eat really good like we eat clean healthy food [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3433.12s)]
*  and they're not like [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3440.32s)]
*  You know very roller coaster-y in their mental stability [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3442.08s)]
*  And so i'm seeing it play out in real time like wow, there are really healthy children [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3447.2s)]
*  Because their sugar levels aren't spiking and crashing. Yeah, and and then you know, it's not even that we don't eat sugar [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3453.44s)]
*  We're just making sure we're getting enough protein to balance out that glucose. So [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3459.6s)]
*  As long as you're balancing out your diet [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3465.2799999999997s)]
*  You're going to be okay if you have a little treat here and there but there are a few things we avoid like red die-fives [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3468.0s)]
*  artificial ingredients [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3474.32s)]
*  seed oils, uh [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3476.64s)]
*  A few other things that just aren't really like real foods. And so we just keep it wholesome and real we eat a lot of your like [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3479.2s)]
*  normal meals [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3488.08s)]
*  but just the healthy version of it and none of the junk process and like [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3489.6s)]
*  You know, we'll stop shop at like cosco for example, because that's like the one of the only grocery stores we have on our island [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3494.16s)]
*  and [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3500.8799999999997s)]
*  90 of what's in there. We're not bringing home [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3502.0s)]
*  So we're choosing to find the good stuff that is wholesome and real but no lucky charms for mountain dew. No [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3505.04s)]
*  We might have a little root beer here and there but [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3512.3999999999996s)]
*  interesting [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3515.8399999999997s)]
*  So all of us have a long mental list all the things that you should be doing [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3517.04s)]
*  But you keep putting off folding your laundry go into the gym. Stop eating oreos doing the dishes, etc, etc, etc [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3521.84s)]
*  Shopping for life insurance probably shouldn't be on that list [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3528.7200000000003s)]

*  I'm like we're going to the beach. We're going to nature. We're getting out of the house and into like [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3635.06s)]
*  um, just this place where they can be creative and uh [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3640.9s)]
*  Just be grounded again, you know, and so I found that like I definitely thrive as a mother in nature. So [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3645.3s)]

*  Thrive in life [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3657.86s)]
*  How much contact do you have with your larger family? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3660.42s)]
*  Yes, I mean we have such a beautiful setup [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3664.18s)]
*  My parents they live on the same property as us and my both my older brothers live within a 10-minute drive [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3667.62s)]
*  And so [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3674.42s)]
*  I got all my niece and nephews my brothers. We have about 12 or 13 grandkids now my parents and so [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3675.54s)]
*  It's just like and they all live next to each other [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3683.54s)]
*  Yeah, we're all like within 10 minute drive of each other [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3686.18s)]
*  so it's really easy to get together and like help each other raise each other's children and [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3688.74s)]
*  My mom is a super grandma. She's so supportive and like is truly there for us and like [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3694.74s)]
*  Um, you know if i'm having a rough season in motherhood, which they come and go, you know [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3699.94s)]
*  It's just part of life. I'm like [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3705.14s)]
*  My mom's there and she's giving me advice and i'm asking her for advice and i'm like [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3707.14s)]
*  How do I get through this mom or on the rare occasion? Please take the children before I lose my mind [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3712.8199999999997s)]
*  Which isn't very often because I have a great relationship with my children and [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3720.1s)]
*  I am healthy. So it's not like I need that all the time, but [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3724.74s)]
*  It is just a blessing to have that so just for perspective because you're famous [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3728.18s)]
*  I people might think well, you know that you can live that way when you're really rich [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3733.1400000000003s)]
*  But um having just been in hawaii recently. I was reminded it's I think the most expensive state [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3738.02s)]
*  It's one of the hardest places to live [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3742.9s)]
*  Um, and it doesn't sound like your family's rich [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3745.94s)]
*  No, I mean right we make decent money and we are a unique situation but [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3750.34s)]
*  I grew up with five of my best friends from childhood born and raised in hawaii [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3756.1000000000004s)]
*  They're now married and have children and almost all of them are homeschooling [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3761.22s)]
*  And they're living a normal very normal life and they're getting by and [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3766.18s)]
*  They're choosing to live a lifestyle that is different, but [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3771.22s)]
*  They aren't anyone [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3776.1s)]
*  You know unique or out. So that's kind of what i'm saying. It's achievable then [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3778.5s)]
*  You can choose to live a certain lifestyle, you know [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3782.74s)]
*  And I think [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3786.74s)]
*  The common thing in america too is like we want to live above our means [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3787.8599999999997s)]
*  so figuring out what is your means and are you living within your means and what [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3792.3399999999997s)]
*  Adaptations can you make so that you could make your dreams come true? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3798.96s)]
*  If you have certain dreams, so to say [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3803.2999999999997s)]
*  And if you choose to not go down that route at least being intentional with the time that you do have your with your children [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3806.3399999999997s)]
*  So when they come home from school having that energy and that mental [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3813.14s)]
*  Capability to be intentional to give them eye contact to give them that quality time [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3819.52s)]
*  I feel like specifically from junior high to high school. It's like the most pivotal years besides obviously childhood's pretty pivotal [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3825.46s)]
*  And their world views are pretty formed. I'm very young but there's these pivotal years [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3835.22s)]
*  Where parents get very little time with their children because they're in school. They're in sports [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3842.34s)]
*  Then they come home and they have homework [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3849.62s)]
*  and random chores maybe [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3852.34s)]
*  and the parents barely get that time with their children and so [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3854.7400000000002s)]
*  Obviously my children aren't in those years, but i'm thinking about those years and how i'm going to approach it [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3859.94s)]
*  And I don't want it to be [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3865.78s)]
*  Mundane or unintentional like I want my husband to have quality time with his son so that [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3868.7400000000002s)]
*  His sons have a good grasp on the world and what they're getting themselves into as they become adults, you know [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3875.78s)]
*  And so what do you think they're getting themselves into as they become adults? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3882.98s)]
*  No, really? I mean you've got three boys and yeah, I mean there's a lot out there [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3887.1400000000003s)]
*  But I I hope that they'll like, you know find a wife pretty young and be good leaders of their household and [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3891.94s)]
*  I want to encourage them and like help them find their way so that they can afford to [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3899.6200000000003s)]
*  Be a husband and a provider [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3905.78s)]
*  So working with them to like figure out what their talents are and like what sort of work they could do to survive [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3908.5800000000004s)]
*  And not just survive but thrive [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3915.5400000000004s)]
*  Um [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3918.02s)]
*  and to say no to the temptations of the world and to respect women and to [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3919.22s)]
*  You know choose a life that is honorable [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3926.42s)]
*  And just and not just go with the flow of like what society is currently at and I think as a male in particular [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3930.1s)]
*  there's a lot of temptation around women and pornography and [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3937.7799999999997s)]
*  None of that really serves society. It's become so normalized [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3942.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, you look, you know, I grew up in hawaii and like [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3947.54s)]
*  it's [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3951.62s)]
*  the most [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3952.74s)]
*  uncovered [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3953.94s)]
*  Area of the world like people are literally walking around and in close to nothing on a regular basis and [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3955.7s)]
*  But I feel like now young men in particular. It's like there's social media and it's just there's so many dark [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3962.82s)]
*  Holes they can get caught up in [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3969.62s)]
*  And even gaming like I am really against gaming. I haven't even really talked about that publicly [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3972.02s)]
*  but [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3977.7s)]
*  There's no way i'm bringing that into my household because I want my boys creating [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3978.58s)]
*  Becoming like building up their skills in life. Like I want them to have [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3984.32s)]
*  You know mentor under a plumber electrician like mechanic have these basic skills so that they're not completely helpless when they [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3989.7799999999997s)]
*  You know start living on their own like just basic life skills that instead they could be gaming [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=3998.74s)]
*  And where is that going to get them and then when they have to start living a real life [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4004.98s)]
*  And they run into challenge [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4010.7400000000002s)]
*  What are they going to do? Are they going to problem solve or are they going to just go zone out and gaming? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4013.22s)]
*  There's a lot of husbands that aren't showing up because they're busy gaming or pornography [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4018.58s)]
*  and so [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4024.26s)]
*  Equipping our boys to say no and to say yes to the good and beautiful things that they could be doing in life [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4025.78s)]
*  And to learn how to provide and serve and protect [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4032.02s)]
*  You've got such an interesting way of presenting [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4037.22s)]
*  What you think so you have a very gentle affect and calm and laid back but what you're saying is like [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4040.66s)]
*  Really radical as compared to [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4046.34s)]
*  I mean, I think every word you've said is true just for the record [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4048.9s)]
*  But it's so different. It's so different. You live on an outer island in the farthest away state out of 50 [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4052.66s)]
*  In a pretty rural state, I think [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4058.74s)]
*  So maybe you don't know how radical what you're saying. Do you have a sense of how different? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4061.54s)]
*  How you live is from how many other people live? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4066.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, i've started to realize that in raising children of like trying to find good friends for my children [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4069.8599999999997s)]
*  And just like some of the boundaries that we are setting on behalf of our children and trying to like [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4077.4599999999996s)]
*  You know what who can they play? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4084.8199999999997s)]
*  What who can they play with what households are good for them to be in and it's it [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4087.3s)]
*  I think it's gonna get even harder in the teenage years [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4093.3s)]
*  So it sounds like you think you have the right to make those decisions as a parent [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4095.78s)]
*  Oh a hundred percent like I think that [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4098.9800000000005s)]
*  if I didn't [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4102.9800000000005s)]
*  Lead guide and protect them like nobody else will [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4105.06s)]
*  Yes [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4109.46s)]
*  No, I mean I couldn't agree more and and don't we have an understanding that the brain isn't fully developed [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4111.06s)]
*  Till 25. Yes for males. I think it is mid 30s for somewhere around there [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4116.9s)]
*  So why would you like hold back protecting them and helping serve and guide and lead them in a healthy direction? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4123.7s)]
*  I think of myself as super healthy [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4132.339999999999s)]
*  And so of course i'm gonna like help lead and guide them along the way and not like just let them [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4134.259999999999s)]
*  Hopefully float out there and figure it out [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4140.42s)]
*  I think that's the strategy for many parents [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4142.98s)]
*  But even to the extent of like hey you're invited to question me son like question what i'm saying [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4144.98s)]
*  Question what your auntie your uncle is saying ask questions and don't be so passive that [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4152.5s)]
*  Everything mama and dada says is you know the end-all say-all [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4159.46s)]
*  so [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4164.58s)]
*  To the extent of like yes, you respect your mother and father, but you're still allowed to ask questions [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4165.62s)]
*  and have your own opinion [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4171.38s)]
*  but [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4173.86s)]
*  You know [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4176.42s)]
*  I do see it in my nine-year-old how much he looks up to his dad and me [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4178.42s)]
*  And how he's willing to like he knows that when mama says like don't eat red dye five [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4184.1s)]
*  It's because she loves him and she's protecting him from eating these neurotoxins [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4189.22s)]
*  That will give him adhd and he doesn't have that currently so we don't want him to get that [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4194.5s)]
*  But he could have it if he keeps eating those over and over and over again [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4200.58s)]
*  And so he trusts me in that I explain why i'm not just like nope [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4204.74s)]
*  You can't have that I explain why he can't have that and why I don't want him [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4209.22s)]
*  And you know what if he ate it once or twice a year i'm not making a huge deal out of it [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4213.54s)]
*  I'm just like hey like we're not bringing that into our household at least [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4218.26s)]
*  How are you going to navigate marijuana? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4222.82s)]
*  Oh, I mean [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4226.5s)]
*  I mean [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4229.3s)]
*  For me, it was actually a really easy one to navigate as a teenager [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4230.5s)]
*  because [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4235.7s)]
*  I think like the way my mom might have talked about it and then even in the public school was like I was highly athletic driven and so I [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4236.98s)]
*  could see that [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4246.74s)]
*  It was a common theme that people lost their drive in life [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4249.06s)]
*  With marijuana in particular and then even i've had a mother-daughter mentorship program and one of our colleges focus on drugs [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4253.54s)]
*  And the coolest thing is we'll show the girls the brain without marijuana and alcohol [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4261.219999999999s)]
*  And the brain with and they look very different like it's very noticeable how healthier [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4267.7s)]
*  Like we had a brain specialist kind of explain the differences and you could see it with your own eye [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4275.139999999999s)]
*  And so that was really cool to me as an adult who's chosen not to like, uh [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4280.74s)]
*  Do marijuana or anything like that, but just talking about it from my perspective of health [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4287.62s)]
*  So that's why you know, I said earlier like encouraging your children and faith and understanding health is so important [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4292.98s)]
*  And talking about like I talk about hey, you know if you go through a challenging season in your life [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4300.26s)]
*  Do you want to go to alcohol or do you want to go to god like what's going to be your strength? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4306.820000000001s)]
*  What's going to serve you and your family is alcohol going to serve your family or is god? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4312.900000000001s)]
*  Like what's going to lead you forward and help you to overcome and adopt and persevere through the challenges that will inevitably come your way? [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4318.34s)]
*  um [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4327.46s)]
*  Certainly not alcohol and drugs which a lot of society is going to that because we [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4328.58s)]
*  Essentially aren't happy with our life or we're looking for an outlet that [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4334.34s)]
*  um numbs some of the pain [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4340.26s)]
*  And so, you know working with our children [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4343.22s)]
*  To face their hardship and to work through their pain and to have a plan for when that comes if they don't have any of that prior to [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4347.22s)]
*  Leaving the household like having a good plan. Like what are you going to do when you face hardship? Are you going to [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4356.74s)]
*  Go to these outlets? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4362.66s)]
*  Are you going to come back to mom and dad or someone who's respectable in your life to help you work through it? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4363.860000000001s)]
*  Because there's certainly been seasons in my life where like why didn't I go to someone? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4369.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah to help me through that exactly and I tried to navigate it by myself and it was [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4375.38s)]
*  It sucked and it was hard and it was awful and i'm like, why didn't I ask for help? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4380.820000000001s)]
*  and [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4386.18s)]
*  um [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4387.46s)]
*  I just like that's not what I want for my children [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4389.62s)]
*  I want them to go and ask someone for help whether it's me or not like that's okay [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4392.42s)]
*  But I hope it's me and if it's not me like [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4396.66s)]
*  They're gonna have a few other people in their life that i'm gonna be like this would be a great person [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4399.78s)]
*  If you don't for some reason don't feel comfortable talking to me [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4403.62s)]
*  Go to this person and like have them spend time with that person in their [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4406.98s)]
*  Um late teen years so that they have a relationship. That's [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4411.7s)]
*  You know encouraging [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4416.0199999999995s)]
*  Why do you think of this pretty common human experience but people? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4418.18s)]
*  Have problems that they could probably sort out quickly if they articulated them in front of somebody else [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4422.900000000001s)]
*  But they don't why? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4430.02s)]
*  Oh my gosh, I feel like there's a lot of reasons why and [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4432.580000000001s)]
*  I think [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4438.900000000001s)]
*  You know [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4440.820000000001s)]
*  that's why [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4442.1s)]
*  Earlier in our conversation I talked about working through some of my issues and motherhood is because [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4443.22s)]
*  you know, I think sometimes we get closed in life or we [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4450.18s)]
*  Are open to teaching or wisdom or you know respecting our elders [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4455.62s)]
*  it's almost like there's this [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4462.900000000001s)]
*  Untalked about level of being where [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4465.2s)]
*  We have pride and we just think we can do it ourselves [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4469.22s)]
*  And I feel like that's almost growing even more now with social media because they're like, oh I can just google what to do [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4473.46s)]
*  Yeah, rather than ask [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4478.820000000001s)]
*  Someone respectable in your life. Like hey, like do you think this is a good life decision? Like should I go down this route? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4481.22s)]
*  um [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4487.9400000000005s)]
*  so [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4488.900000000001s)]
*  for me [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4490.18s)]
*  I don't know i'm kind of going about this answer in a long way but [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4491.46s)]
*  I'm now asking three different people for advice if I have something that feels overwhelming or challenging [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4495.860000000001s)]
*  I mean i'm going to the three different people and trying to see if it will align for them if their advice to me will align or [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4502.6s)]
*  you know [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4510.52s)]
*  Like just having someone respectable to speak into my life over challenging subjects that feel like I need help in this area [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4511.8s)]
*  So you're approaching your own life with humility. You're acknowledging that you don't you don't know [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4518.76s)]
*  Every answer to every question. Yeah, and you know if it feels like something really hard [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4524.12s)]
*  Just not being afraid to ask for help and [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4529.72s)]
*  you know, maybe there is this level of like [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4533.72s)]
*  That distancing in junior high and high school where like you're almost like separating from your parents too early [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4538.2s)]
*  Yes, and then you go off to college and adult life and you're like, well, I don't really have that relationship with my mom and dad [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4545.16s)]
*  So i'm not going to ask them for help or we didn't work through some of our issues [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4551.48s)]
*  As in that relationship through the high school years and so there's not that level of like you can come to me like i'm here [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4556.12s)]
*  For you and i'll like accept you no matter what the challenge is [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4562.92s)]
*  and so trying to keep that relationship open and [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4567.24s)]
*  just [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4571.5599999999995s)]
*  communicative so that [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4572.58s)]
*  When the real challenges come there is an openness and like [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4574.599999999999s)]
*  they'll be willing to ask for help and obviously there's different characters and [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4578.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, you know, I can see already like trying to raise the different characters in my children [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4583.24s)]
*  I'm like, they're very different and it's going to require like some problem solving or adaptability to their different [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4587.96s)]
*  You know personality and character and so yeah genetics is real. Yeah. Yeah, the kids are different [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4595.639999999999s)]
*  So, um, you said you have a mentor [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4601.08s)]
*  ship program [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4604.2s)]
*  Where you're dealing with young people who are not your children? Yeah, what do you notice about them? What? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4605.8s)]
*  Yeah, so [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4613.16s)]
*  I've always just had a heart for teenage girls and maybe it's because of what I faced at such a young age [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4614.759999999999s)]
*  Like when I lost my arm, I was 13 years old and it's such a pivotal season [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4620.28s)]
*  going into those teenage years, but then there was this one woman who [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4625.32s)]
*  Would pick up my girlfriends and I and speak into our lives [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4629.5599999999995s)]
*  She would mentor us and encouraged us in relationships in particular. She like like equipped us to [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4632.679999999999s)]
*  Um enter into the dating realm and to look for a husband in a healthy way [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4639.5599999999995s)]
*  and this woman wasn't like [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4644.68s)]
*  super [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4647.62s)]
*  Appealing so to say like I would say the fact that she like brought chocolates [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4648.68s)]
*  Brought chocolate and like brought us to the beach was like the lure so to say [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4653.0s)]
*  But she was willing to just show up and like even if she wasn't like super cool, you know [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4658.28s)]
*  Like as a teenager you're looking for those cool people to hang out with [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4663.4s)]
*  She wasn't like super cool [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4667.8s)]
*  but she like spoke into her lives and she made the most of what she had and she made such an impact in my [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4669.16s)]
*  life and so I just feel like i've been given a unique platform to speak into young people's lives and [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4675.4s)]
*  I'm very passionate about [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4681.96s)]
*  like [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4684.76s)]
*  Social media as well. Like the big thing i've noticed is the girls who you know [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4685.56s)]
*  i'm working with girls between like 9 to 18 [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4691.08s)]
*  And they're alongside of their mothers, but the girls who are highly active on social media like you can just tell right away [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4695.58s)]
*  Like they dress more promiscuous. They're very aware of their being [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4703.18s)]
*  um, you know, they're very like [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4707.5s)]
*  aware of just how they look and how they carry themselves [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4710.22s)]
*  And it's almost like they've got something to prove [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4715.42s)]
*  um, they're trying to be cool or like, you know be accepted in a certain way and I just [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4718.54s)]
*  I really just noticed a vast difference in the girls that are active on social media and the girls that are not [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4724.7s)]
*  and [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4731.34s)]
*  You know either way, they're very lovable. Who's happier? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4732.7s)]
*  Definitely the girls that are not active on social media. Oh, it's that less obvious. Yes [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4736.86s)]
*  they have a lot less issues and um [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4742.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely really interesting and there have been extreme cases where we've had some girls who are really struggling [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4746.94s)]
*  in their life and their mom's like we've already done everything we've done counseling we've done like [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4754.46s)]
*  Drugs to try to like calm them down or like help them not be depressed and it's just not working [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4758.9400000000005s)]
*  And so they're coming into this program like let's just like try it [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4763.66s)]
*  You never know and I think there's just something about the community element and like talking about the truth and the challenges of the world [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4767.42s)]
*  So we're talking about all these different [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4774.46s)]
*  topics dating drugs conflict resolution faith [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4776.46s)]
*  um [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4780.9400000000005s)]
*  All the different topics that i'm like naturally passionate about and even like health and stuff and like just trying to equip the girls [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4782.3s)]
*  But at the end of the day like the young girls might be really excited to see bethany [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4789.66s)]
*  Like as their mentor, but the goal is not me. It's their mom [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4794.3s)]
*  So their mom's coming in and doing it with their daughter and it's about that mother daughter relationship because [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4798.46s)]
*  I remind the girls i'm like hey girls [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4804.38s)]
*  Like i'm not going to be there for you when the going gets rough [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4805.9800000000005s)]
*  But your mom is like she's the one that will die for you and like do whatever it takes to [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4809.1s)]
*  Be there for you in your tough seasons [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4814.540000000001s)]
*  And so maybe you don't see eye to eye with her on everything and maybe you have a little sandpaper of a relationship, but [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4816.860000000001s)]
*  Your mom loves you so much. And so it's just kind of about bringing back that family unit [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4823.26s)]
*  and making that be the focal point of [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4829.5s)]
*  the mentorship [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4833.02s)]
*  Experience program and so it's just been yeah, it's really interesting though to unpack like [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4834.46s)]
*  The difference in the children who are being exposed a lot more and then the ones who are not and [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4839.9s)]
*  To me it feels a little devastating because i'm like, oh, I had such a good childhood like [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4846.94s)]
*  You girls should be like adventuring in nature and filming like cute little like funny movies on a little camcorder [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4851.9800000000005s)]
*  and instead we got like tiktok dancing and like just like [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4859.74s)]
*  endless media scrolling and tv watching and [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4864.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, I don't want to be so negative because I know there's beautiful moments in everyone's lives, but [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4868.94s)]
*  um, I just feel like there's so much more to be had when [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4874.38s)]
*  we're creating and [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4878.7s)]
*  um being artistic and letting our strengths and talents be used and [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4880.7s)]
*  um pursuing like the good and beautiful things in life and having like really open like [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4886.94s)]
*  relationships and quality time and [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4893.74s)]
*  One thing i'm working with my children is like teaching them like I try to look in their eyes [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4896.38s)]
*  Like i've met a lot of people and it's like we almost are losing eye contact [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4900.94s)]
*  like something as simple as that like trying to look people in the eye and [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4905.1s)]
*  Starting in your own household like once you start to be aware of it. You're like, whoa like [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4909.18s)]
*  They haven't looked me in the eye today [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4913.9s)]
*  And so you have to but like I have to lead my children to be able to look [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4916.38s)]
*  Me in the eye and so like making sure i'm not so busy that I can't like slow down and like [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4920.46s)]
*  Check them out and like give them that eye contact that they deserve in that like quality time [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4925.900000000001s)]
*  so one thing I love to do with my six-year-old in particular and [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4931.18s)]
*  He's super sweet and but he has like this interesting personality that you know [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4934.860000000001s)]
*  It feels a little harder to get through to and so one thing I like to do with him is play rummy cards. So [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4940.3s)]
*  He's only six and he's doing so amazing like he beats me all the time at rummy and like he'll be like calculating how much points [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4945.820000000001s)]
*  He has versus how much points I have throughout the game [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4952.780000000001s)]
*  And like this is like one way that I like to connect with him that is really sweet and there's nothing else going on [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4956.46s)]
*  I mean, obviously there's little sissy trying to steal the cards, but for the most part [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4962.22s)]
*  It's just him and me having this moment to not checking instagram during the games. No [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4967.5s)]
*  Phone set aside and it's just like him and I my six-year-old who [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4973.18s)]
*  Actually can play cards really well and like he's doing math at the same time, but he's like connecting with mom [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4978.14s)]
*  A lot of bad things going on in the world that honestly not many of us can have an effect on rising crime [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4984.46s)]
*  Failing schools a tanking economy. What can you do about that? Well [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4991.34s)]
*  Not a lot, but you can get your own house in order and above all [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=4996.38s)]
*  You can spend money with merchants with companies that support your values that are making us a better country and not a worse country [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5000.459999999999s)]
*  But how do you find those companies? Well, that's where public square comes in [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5007.58s)]
*  Public square actively curates the best products from america's small businesses to help families lead happier healthier more productive and connected lives [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5012.0599999999995s)]
*  That means fewer errands to big box stores [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5020.7s)]
*  Let's searching to find wholesome alternatives to the garbage being offered in our culture and more quality time spent with people you love most [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5023.42s)]
*  If you want to fix your country, you've got to strengthen yourself and your home and you need to spend your dollars where they do good [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5031.179999999999s)]
*  and not bad [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5036.78s)]
*  Rebuilding america takes place one small change at a time with wise spending supporting people who support your family [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5038.54s)]
*  Not funding people who hate you [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5046.94s)]
*  If you want to do that public square.com is the answer public square.com [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5049.339999999999s)]
*  How [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5054.54s)]
*  Rare are your views where you live? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5055.58s)]
*  Um [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5059.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's interesting. Yeah, I think it's fairly rare [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5060.54s)]
*  Um, you know like one thing for example, like my children are looking out the window [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5063.82s)]
*  when we drive so [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5069.099999999999s)]
*  That's becoming more and more rare like children don't stare out the window [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5071.66s)]
*  They don't have that moment to be bored i'm like I grew up staring out the window and looking at the clouds like [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5075.0199999999995s)]
*  And like looking for dead animals on the side of the road, you know [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5080.7s)]
*  This is like the life I had i'm like you boys can do the same [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5085.099999999999s)]
*  I'm not giving them my phone to entertain them while we drive even if they're being a little fussy or whiny [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5087.98s)]
*  Like it's just not an option. Like I don't allow that [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5093.9s)]
*  and so [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5097.419999999999s)]
*  We'll turn on stories i'll let them um pitch in sometimes they get to [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5099.74s)]
*  Pick the music so like my six-year-old he either wants country music or he wants piano [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5104.94s)]
*  That's his top two choices. And so i'll give them ownership sometimes like or take turns with sometimes we're listening to mama music [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5110.62s)]
*  Sometimes we're listening to baby music if the baby is fussing and then sometimes we're listening to like classical piano or um a story [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5117.9s)]
*  on the podcast [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5125.179999999999s)]
*  audiobook [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5126.54s)]
*  and so [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5127.82s)]
*  That's an example of like yeah, we're using technology [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5128.86s)]
*  But we're not like giving our phones to like shush our children so to say [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5131.9s)]
*  And it's interesting because it doesn't really ever cross my mind to need to like quiet my children with a device [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5137.179999999999s)]
*  Like because we just have things established and they're already [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5143.9s)]
*  You know doing their own how do you handle long flights? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5149.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, we let them watch movies on long airplane rides and they're stoked and they're like getting their movie time [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5152.86s)]
*  But then like it makes them look forward to traveling and I feel okay with that because it's like we're not consuming all the time [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5159.42s)]
*  And it's not like the 20th movie they've watched this this week [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5166.0599999999995s)]
*  Um, do your neighbor so you said you had five friends from childhood all kind of wound up living like you [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5170.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah, very similar, but we're all kind of scattered throughout the island [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5175.66s)]
*  Sometimes they'll meet up at the beach, but we don't see each other as much as we like [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5179.9s)]
*  But are do you stick out in your community? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5183.98s)]
*  I think I do [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5187.58s)]
*  But also I would say a lot of people in hawaii are spending like we live to live we don't work to live [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5189.26s)]
*  Like we're all going to the beach as soon as we're not working everyone's like [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5196.14s)]
*  Checking the surf forecasts and scheduling their life around the surf forecast [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5201.26s)]
*  I mean if they can sometimes like you gotta work when you gotta work, but [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5206.38s)]
*  I feel like people in hawaii my friend actually brought this up the other day like we very much so live to live [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5211.099999999999s)]
*  And we're going to like enjoy the sunset a lot and like [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5216.62s)]
*  You know get out in nature [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5220.94s)]
*  Because it's so easy to access out there [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5223.0199999999995s)]
*  But there's also like people live in beautiful places and never go outside. Yeah, true. That's probably true [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5227.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know. I try not to like pay attention too much to what everyone else is doing [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5232.7s)]
*  But you're not considered like a freak or people are nice to at the grocery store. Yeah, I know like [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5237.82s)]
*  It's very like low-key, I mean I would say hawaii has a lot of pocket of like [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5242.54s)]
*  You know people living outside of the box [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5248.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but you're I mean, how is christianity viewed? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5251.5s)]
*  I feel like that's an interesting one and it feels like it's changing right now [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5256.299999999999s)]
*  With like kind of this new world religion of like the pride lgtq plus [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5262.46s)]
*  Quokk whatever movement [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5268.7s)]
*  You said the acronym wrong and i'm glad [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5273.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so anyway [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5275.98s)]
*  But I feel like there's like this new surge of a new religion and it's almost like anti-religion [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5278.3s)]
*  So it doesn't matter what your religion is. It's like against all the religions so to say unless the religion tends to be a little more [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5284.14s)]
*  like uh [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5292.94s)]
*  Like relaxed so to say [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5295.099999999999s)]
*  um, it's definitely anti-christian and [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5297.42s)]
*  I think because it feels attacked by christianity because there's moral ground in christianity like the bible says thou shall not lie [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5301.820000000001s)]
*  But then it has all the other ten commandments and when you look at someone's life who maybe lives more in that fashion [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5310.860000000001s)]
*  They bring a lot less pain into the world [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5319.58s)]
*  You know when you're lying killing stealing like that's not good for the world [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5322.62s)]
*  Yeah, and so like there's so much beauty within it [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5327.82s)]
*  But people are rejecting it because there's a few of the things like you should be faithful [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5330.86s)]
*  Before you're even married you should be faithful [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5337.0199999999995s)]
*  And let society does not want to be faithful [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5339.66s)]
*  and so that is a [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5343.099999999999s)]
*  it's a [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5345.099999999999s)]
*  It feels unachievable and unapproachable [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5346.54s)]
*  Because society has normalized being unfaithful and so [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5350.08s)]
*  People feel defensive when they feel like they are being told what to do. Yes, but yeah [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5354.48s)]
*  Someone who lives out a faithful life is such a blessing [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5360.32s)]
*  right [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5363.599999999999s)]
*  they [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5364.88s)]
*  like, you know when you meet a married couple who've been married 50 years you're like [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5365.76s)]
*  That is incredible. Like that's so beautiful and they've been faithful and they've chosen to [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5370.96s)]
*  Love and serve whoever they committed their life to their spouse and that is such a blessing in society [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5377.68s)]
*  and it's likely that their children are more stable and healthy in society and so [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5384.56s)]
*  I just get so stoked on that like i'm like when I meet the couple that's been married 50 years [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5391.68s)]
*  I'm like give me advice. Tell me like what should I do? Like how can I achieve what you've achieved? Do you know? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5396.64s)]
*  And what do they say? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5402.64s)]
*  Uh, I mean the answers are very different but um, i'm just always willing to like ask them for advice. I can't think of any [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5404.24s)]
*  Any big ones right? I can't think of any if you could give advice [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5412.5599999999995s)]
*  You haven't been married 50 years, but you have a successful marriage [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5416.96s)]
*  we're at 11 years and uh [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5420.24s)]
*  I would say [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5424.5599999999995s)]
*  the biggest thing in our relationship [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5426.16s)]
*  Is truly the grace of god and looking to god to be the author and finisher of our faith to [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5428.9800000000005s)]
*  Understand that like his grace is sufficient for me [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5436.820000000001s)]
*  And when I understand that [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5440.74s)]
*  Then I know his grace is sufficient for my husband [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5443.780000000001s)]
*  And if god is sufficient for my husband then that then leads me to be gracious on my husband and vice versa him on me [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5447.7s)]
*  And that is the foundation of a healthy marriage and no matter what you're going to go through and like how hard the seasons may be [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5456.9800000000005s)]
*  You're going to be able to work through it because your foundation is not in yourself and your ability to be [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5464.900000000001s)]
*  The perfect husband or wife but your foundation is in the ability to trust in god or not even the ability but [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5470.820000000001s)]
*  To allow god to work through your life. Yes, and so [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5478.900000000001s)]
*  I think that's my number one advice. So that's great advice. So you said that you see the rise of a global religion [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5482.5s)]
*  Um, are you ever confronted by people who believe in that religion? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5490.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean and how do you how do you respond [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5496.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting because i've just been trying to unpack to unpack it so I can better understand it and [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5500.74s)]
*  It's being promoted under the lens the lens of being loving right, right [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5508.740000000001s)]
*  to be loving towards all those people but [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5515.38s)]
*  To everyone around you regardless of their views [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5520.26s)]
*  And so it's almost disregarding having an opinion or a worldview or you know a belief system [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5523.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like disregarding having any kind of like moral foundation [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5531.3s)]
*  And that you have to love and be accepting of whatever they want to do regardless of how destructive it may be [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5536.52s)]
*  um [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5544.360000000001s)]
*  and so [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5545.56s)]
*  You know to me like I think faithfulness is essential for a healthy society [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5546.84s)]
*  And yet people don't want to embrace that [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5553.240000000001s)]
*  Um, they want to be free so to say and like do whatever they want with whoever they want [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5557.4800000000005s)]
*  Um at any point in time in their life and [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5564.12s)]
*  What they don't understand is that that is painful in the long run [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5568.5199999999995s)]
*  to not have a relationship that is stable and faithful and [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5573.16s)]
*  Committed and enduring that is hard and that is painful [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5579.0599999999995s)]
*  and yet [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5584.44s)]
*  Society just wants to promote that as if it's a good like it's you know, do whatever makes you happy in the moment [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5586.04s)]
*  and so [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5593.320000000001s)]
*  I the way I view it is like [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5595.320000000001s)]
*  To be unfaithful is not good. It's not healthy [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5598.200000000001s)]
*  for a strong society it doesn't lead for you know [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5601.88s)]
*  confident children when their parents are [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5607.56s)]
*  you know breaking apart and [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5611.080000000001s)]
*  You know, maybe you have already [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5614.76s)]
*  Maybe you've already hit that point in life where you've split from your partner it became unbearable [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5617.799999999999s)]
*  It was painful [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5623.16s)]
*  And I wouldn't go so far as to say like god's grace is not sufficient for you [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5624.599999999999s)]
*  Like his grace can be sufficient for you no matter how awful things may be [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5628.44s)]
*  And he can work in your children's lives. So i'm not like saying [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5633.08s)]
*  you know [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5637.719999999999s)]
*  But I just think that if society [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5639.719999999999s)]
*  Can strive to be faithful [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5643.4s)]
*  Like that alone could flip society on its head to be more beautiful and more [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5645.879999999999s)]
*  um [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5651.96s)]
*  just full of life and passion and purpose and [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5653.48s)]
*  you know, I think most of society when they see a [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5659.08s)]
*  Married couple who are in good relations with one another 50 years later [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5663.08s)]
*  Like everyone's celebrating like everyone's cheering that on and like in awe of that [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5667.48s)]
*  Because it is hard and it is hard to make it that long I think [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5672.839999999999s)]
*  and it's already seen to be you know, you look at the the [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5677.0s)]
*  Divorce rates so to say and it's it's super hard out there and people aren't making it very far [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5681.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's that's probably harder than sticking together long run. Yes, totally [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5687.24s)]
*  So tell me about brave books [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5693.08s)]
*  so [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5696.5199999999995s)]
*  I feel like the last few years has been crazy starting with 2020 like [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5698.12s)]
*  I would say I was pretty passive when it came to like the world views so to say like [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5702.84s)]
*  I had my world views and I had things I wanted to live out in my own life [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5708.12s)]
*  But I wasn't like hyper aware of like what's going on in society [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5712.2s)]
*  And then when like you I can't overstate i've been to where you live. So I know how far away you were [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5716.68s)]
*  Yeah, and so then 2020 2021 hit and like all this craziness started happening and like you can kind of start to see [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5722.84s)]
*  Through like what is actually going on here? Because I don't think it's as simple as a virus [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5730.92s)]
*  Being you know, you don't [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5736.76s)]
*  Just emerge from wet market organically and no [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5739.4800000000005s)]
*  so so then [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5743.56s)]
*  You know [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5746.04s)]
*  I just started to realize like who I partner with and where I put my money matters [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5747.0s)]
*  And as a professional athlete like you're given all kinds of deals [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5753.16s)]
*  That you know could make you money, you know [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5757.8s)]
*  And but they're not necessarily like good things, you know [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5761.48s)]
*  Like for example, i've had a professional career in surfing and I never took a deal with an energy drink [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5766.68s)]
*  Because I just don't believe in those and [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5774.52s)]
*  That was an area where I drew the line because I didn't think it was healthy and it's not something I want to promote [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5777.400000000001s)]
*  To anyone let alone children who look up to me [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5783.160000000001s)]
*  What if it was? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5787.160000000001s)]
*  Mountain dew berry blast no mountain dew berry blast [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5788.92s)]
*  Okay, just what i'm trying to find your red lines. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I do drink coffee [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5793.400000000001s)]
*  So I might have promoted a little coffee drink here and there. I love coffee [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5797.88s)]
*  Um [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5801.4s)]
*  You know [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5802.84s)]
*  But i'm promoting smoothies and i'm promoting like finding your fuel and energy and food and taking care of yourself and like just living a healthy lifestyle [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5803.24s)]
*  But fast forward 2020 and all that chaos hits and i'm like where what are we promoting? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5813.0s)]
*  And so I get this opportunity to I get brave books emailing me and being like hey [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5819.16s)]
*  Do you want to write a children's book with us and i'm like, oh, yeah, let's go [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5824.44s)]
*  But this company is standing against a lot of the societal norms and they're trying to build the family [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5828.68s)]
*  They're trying to build up children to have solid identities to say no to the lives of the world to [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5835.320000000001s)]
*  Be aware of like the challenges that they're gonna face [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5843.72s)]
*  As they grow about life and now i'm reading them to my children [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5847.72s)]
*  I'm like this is the raddest book ever to be able to read my children to sleep [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5851.24s)]
*  And when you say something for people not from hawaii when you say something's the raddest book ever that's good good epic [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5855.96s)]
*  So like for example one of my favorite brave books besides my own [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5864.04s)]
*  I mean like I like my book but i'm just not like that [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5867.64s)]
*  But um, it's about this little boy who has to save his sister and he has to like go on this crazy journey to find [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5870.2s)]
*  This ice flower and if he drips the little ice flower on her lips, she'll she'll survive the [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5877.400000000001s)]
*  The pokey that she stepped on that's gonna poison her and so he's having to like basically become a man and like [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5883.88s)]
*  Save his little sister and it's like the sweetest little story and now my three-year-old's like [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5891.48s)]
*  I'm gonna go find an ice flower for my baby sister [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5896.36s)]
*  And it's like it's computing in his head like the life that he should live is to save the [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5899.96s)]
*  the young women in his life and to protect her and to [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5906.68s)]
*  um, you know [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5910.5199999999995s)]
*  Face his fears on her behalf and he goes on this like gnarly journey and he's crying at one point and it's just this [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5913.0s)]
*  Rad little book. Uh, it's a I think it was called the son of truth [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5919.4800000000005s)]
*  No, no, it wasn't the son of truth, but that's another one. That's really good, too [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5923.400000000001s)]
*  But anyway, i'm like my agent's like hey, are you sure you want to partner with this company? [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5927.0s)]
*  Because when's all the big [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5931.240000000001s)]
*  Corporational sort of companies see you partnering with brave books. They're not likely gonna want to [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5932.900000000001s)]
*  um [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5938.280000000001s)]
*  Partner with you as much anymore and i'm like, oh my gosh [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5939.16s)]
*  It felt like I was like walking off a cliff and I think I kind of did walk off some sort of cliff [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5942.28s)]
*  But like I felt like a good one a good cliff [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5947.24s)]
*  Yeah, and and then like [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5950.599999999999s)]
*  So I partnered with brave books. I wrote my book surfing past fear. It's a really sweet story inspiring children to overcome their fears [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5953.4s)]
*  and and then [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5961.16s)]
*  about [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5963.32s)]
*  nine months later [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5964.5199999999995s)]
*  The world surf league starts allowing males to compete in the female division and [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5966.28s)]
*  I'm the only one walking off that cliff [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5972.92s)]
*  Saying no like this is not okay and we're not about to allow males to compete [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5976.2s)]
*  Against i'm not about to have males competing against me willingly [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5982.5199999999995s)]
*  and [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5987.16s)]
*  That was a whole nother [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5988.12s)]
*  Just step of faith in that [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5991.0s)]
*  Someone's got to say no and nobody else did [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5993.8s)]
*  Literally, I don't think one female maybe like a couple lesser known like kind of like not [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=5998.52s)]
*  very vocal girls, like I think there was a lot of women not for it, but [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6005.64s)]
*  the unfortunate thing was the world surf league had all the [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6010.92s)]
*  Athletes say like hey, you're not allowed to say anything deemed derogatory or negative towards the world surf league [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6014.6s)]
*  Or we will find you and disqualify you from competing [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6021.16s)]
*  So shut up and obey. Yeah, and so that was like the [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6026.44s)]
*  The contract they had signed um the december prior to that year [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6030.5199999999995s)]
*  And they literally get an email they didn't even get a vocal warning like hey males are now allowed to compete in the female division [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6035.48s)]
*  As long as their hormones reach this certain level [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6042.76s)]
*  And they didn't even get a warning. They just get an email in the inbox [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6045.72s)]
*  And i'm like, oh no way, this is not okay, and i'm not for this and [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6050.04s)]
*  I think I lost some major deals that year. I think I had had a deal on the table with ford [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6057.16s)]
*  And that never happened [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6064.44s)]
*  And I think it was around that time when I was like, nope [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6066.28s)]
*  I'm not for this and I like made a public statement and and what kind of reaction did you get to that? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6069.48s)]
*  I would say it was mostly positive like but there was some gnarly negative intertwined [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6075.64s)]
*  But I feel like most of the I had people out of the woodworks like stopping me in our local grocery store [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6081.32s)]
*  Like thank you so much for speaking up like we're so proud of you [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6088.12s)]
*  But there was also some really aggressive like I have like this shark gang on tiktok that like they're like we're on team shark [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6092.04s)]
*  Like what [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6100.12s)]
*  Yeah, some like crazies out there but you know what [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6103.08s)]
*  Whatever side of the spectrum you are. I feel like there's crazies in the mix of like [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6106.280000000001s)]
*  either end like there's just extremists that are hateful and harsh and will say gnarly things and [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6110.84s)]
*  But it definitely was like an intense season and I probably let it like affect me more than I should though [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6117.8s)]
*  I didn't look too much. I was like, hon [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6123.8s)]
*  You can look if you want but i'm not looking because I need to go to sleep tonight [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6125.88s)]
*  Good for you. Not looking is a is a huge step. I know sometimes you just have to not look and [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6129.400000000001s)]
*  I'm not a looker. Yeah, you're probably better off much better off. Yeah, and [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6138.04s)]
*  Yeah, so anyway partnering with companies like brave books and now i'm partnered with public square [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6144.28s)]
*  Like you can literally put your dollar where your values matter and I think that really matters like [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6149.4800000000005s)]
*  There is a team of amazing people trying to build a parallel economy that isn't founded on these [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6155.24s)]
*  weird agendas and these [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6163.16s)]
*  Hate division death. Yeah, just this gnarliness or this new world religion that they're trying to shove down children's throats to make them [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6165.72s)]
*  Like more confused than ever and so brave books is inspiring families to speak into their children's lives [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6174.84s)]
*  Early on so that they can go into society and not be confused not be [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6181.72s)]
*  hateful on themselves and you know reject their god-given beauties but to embrace their god-given [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6187.8s)]
*  talents and the person that they've been [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6195.4800000000005s)]
*  Formed to be and I feel like this new world religion is like, oh just be whatever you want flow [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6198.360000000001s)]
*  Whatever direction you want and like [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6204.52s)]
*  It really doesn't lead to happiness. It leads to just [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6207.240000000001s)]
*  darkness it leads to despair and darkness and you know, you can even look at the statistics and know that [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6210.6s)]
*  You know some of these people that are choosing to amputate their body parts are not healthy [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6218.200000000001s)]
*  And they're regretting their decisions and they're taking hormones that essentially make them get disease earlier on in life than they should [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6224.360000000001s)]
*  And i'm like we're cheering this on because they just feel like they want to be different than they actually are [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6232.84s)]
*  Like I have one arm. I would never wish that on anyone [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6240.2s)]
*  Like why would you amputate perfectly good body parts just to look a certain way? [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6244.04s)]
*  Like it doesn't make sense to look and be a certain way and like to do such extreme measures [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6248.36s)]
*  And yet society is like let's go granted. I think after I spoke out against males in female sports [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6254.12s)]
*  I think [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6262.76s)]
*  This majority of society is like nope this ain't okay [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6264.12s)]
*  But they just might not be voicing their opinions. Did the surf league change their position? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6267.96s)]
*  No, and I think ultimately they're trying to be accepted into the olympic [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6273.88s)]
*  Rules so they're following the olympic rules. So the olympics [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6281.48s)]
*  Is choosing to allow males into female sports and so the world surf league is just following their lead [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6286.44s)]
*  so to say [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6293.8s)]
*  So joke. Yeah, I mean I would say the athletes are incredible and I would like highly [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6295.4800000000005s)]
*  I highly celebrate the athleticism and the hard work of these athletes [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6302.84s)]
*  But the organization behind is definitely not serving the athletes to the best of its ability [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6307.160000000001s)]
*  And it's not looking at the realities of like a male competing against a female is just simply not fair and like should never be okay [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6312.92s)]
*  I couldn't agree more [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6320.68s)]
*  So I wanted to end on something that we were talking about off camera that I thought was so cool and revealing [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6323.08s)]
*  we're talking about social media and [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6328.280000000001s)]
*  One of my daughters is a huge fan of yours. So she was showing me her social media last night [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6331.320000000001s)]
*  I don't actually have the app instagram, but she's showing me this. Yeah, so cool [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6334.68s)]
*  And she was saying this woman has the most beautiful children i've i've ever seen [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6340.04s)]
*  Um, so we were talking about social media this morning and you were saying what you just said on camera [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6345.16s)]
*  Which is that you really notice its effects on young women [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6348.68s)]
*  And but you've chosen to put your own children in some of your pictures and videos for a very specific reason that I want you [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6353.16s)]
*  To explain because I thought it was just wonderful [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6360.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean i've gone back and forth on like do I share my family life on social media or not? And [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6362.52s)]
*  I just [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6370.4400000000005s)]
*  from my perspective like [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6371.8s)]
*  I want to inspire the next generation to embrace and look forward to motherhood [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6374.360000000001s)]
*  And [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6380.2s)]
*  There are people that I follow that make me like just look forward to waking up to my children every day [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6381.08s)]
*  They have a really positive outlook on motherhood. They inspire me to be the best mother's mother I can be [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6387.16s)]
*  And they're not hiding their family life so to say and so there is this like kind of balance [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6393.639999999999s)]
*  That like a lot of people will just refuse to show family, but I really want to inspire this next generation [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6399.48s)]
*  And I think like so many people i've gotten so many messages of like your family's so beautiful [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6406.3s)]
*  Like I want to be a mom someday and like that to me is like [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6412.38s)]
*  So encouraging and I just want [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6416.46s)]
*  People to know that motherhood is a blessing and to be a mom is one of the greatest roles in life [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6419.34s)]
*  And I feel like there's a big movement that is against that right now [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6425.9s)]
*  And it's you know, there's a lot of memeing around [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6429.66s)]
*  Oh, I just can't wait to go to bed can't wait to like silence the children like just kind of like [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6434.14s)]
*  frustrations over like motherhood [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6439.96s)]
*  And I want to just encourage women to know that motherhood is such a blessing and that children [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6442.700000000001s)]
*  are [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6449.26s)]
*  You know [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6450.860000000001s)]
*  Like that is the high of my day. I go to bed and even if I had an amazing day aside from them [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6452.06s)]
*  Like they are my highlight they're the thing that i'm thinking about when I go to bed and i'm like, oh my gosh [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6459.34s)]
*  Even on the rough days. I'm like there's always that sweet moment that [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6465.66s)]
*  I [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6469.82s)]
*  Am like thinking about how my three-year-old came and gave me a big hug and kiss when I gave [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6471.0199999999995s)]
*  Came back from surfing or something like that [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6476.7s)]
*  And he was the highlight of my two-hour window like it wasn't the surfing by myself [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6479.66s)]
*  It was like the coming home and getting a big hug and kiss from my three-year-old and so i'm hoping to inspire this [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6485.18s)]
*  next generation to know that [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6490.9400000000005s)]
*  Motherhood is such a gift and to look forward to that because it's such a blessing [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6493.1s)]
*  I won't even ask why anyone would want to deny people the greatest pleasure in life [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6498.54s)]
*  But I just commend you for reminding the rest of us that it is the greatest pleasure in life. It is it's such a blessing [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6504.46s)]
*  Bethany hamilton, thank you very much [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6510.46s)]
*  So it turns out that youtube is suppressing our show I know [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6515.18s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year with everything at stake google would be putting its thumb on the scale and preventing you from hearing [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6521.64s)]
*  Anything that the people in charge don't want you to hear but it turns out it's happening. So what can you do about it? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6530.06s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, but that's a waste of time [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6535.34s)]
*  I'm not in charge of google or we could find a way around it a way that you could actually get information. That's true [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6538.14s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6545.26s)]
*  And the way to do that on youtube we think is to subscribe to our channel subscribe [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6547.34s)]
*  And you'll have a much higher chance [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6552.700000000001s)]
*  Of hearing what we say and we hope you will [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzl3VH9PwRs&t=6555.18s)]
