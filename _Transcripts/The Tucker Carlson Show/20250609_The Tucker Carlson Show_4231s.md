# Pavel Durov Speaks Out for the First Time Since His Politically-Motivated Arrest in France
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg)
*  Well, I'm glad you're still here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm also glad I'm still here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4.48s)]
*  I mean, those of us who know you and who have followed you looked at our phones one morning [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=5.48s)]
*  in August, I think. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=9.6s)]
*  And it was, Paulder, disappears in France, arrested. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=11.44s)]
*  And then, you know, no one heard from you for several days. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=15.84s)]
*  It was kind of, it was actually kind of a pivot point in the way I understand Europe, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=18.52s)]
*  speaking for myself. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=23.88s)]
*  So if you don't mind, I don't think you've done any interviews since then. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Like, what happened that day? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=28.36s)]
*  Just like the events of the day, let's start there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=30.72s)]
*  August, last year. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=32.96s)]
*  August last year, I arrived to Paris and I'm greeted in the airport by a few... [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=34.64s)]
*  What were you doing here? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=40.64s)]
*  I just, for touristic purposes, I was just hanging around for a couple of days and then [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=41.84s)]
*  I was supposed to go to Finland after. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=47.44s)]
*  And I wasn't supposed to stay. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=50.2s)]
*  There was no business meeting of any kind. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=53.28s)]
*  I was greeted by policemen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=57.2s)]
*  They asked me certain questions, asked me to follow them. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=59.04s)]
*  Were you confused? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=62.72s)]
*  Like, why are policemen meeting me at the airport? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=63.72s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=65.36s)]
*  At first, I thought there may be some additional security checks because of the Olympics, the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=66.36s)]
*  Paralympics, something's going on. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=70.8s)]
*  Julia, my girlfriend, she was worried. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=73.32s)]
*  She was asking me, is it all right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=75.84s)]
*  I said, it's all right. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=77.44s)]
*  It's France, it's fine, of course. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=79.04s)]
*  And then they read me a list of charges, like, I know, 16 charges, all kinds of crimes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=83.2s)]
*  I was very confused at first because I have nothing to do with crime. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=89.2s)]
*  I've never been convicted. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=93.04s)]
*  We are a company that is trying to comply with the best standards. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=94.68s)]
*  And so at that moment, I realized that it's not something I did, it's something other [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  people did using the app I created, Telegram, which is used by a billion people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=108.56s)]
*  So probably some people- [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Do you know all of them? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=115.84s)]
*  Unfortunately not. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=120.0s)]
*  I try my best to meet more. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=121.0s)]
*  So yeah, and then I was put into a car with a small motorcade, police cars with sirens, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=125.12s)]
*  which is funny because in the previous countries that I visited, I also was accompanied by [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  motorcades because I was visiting the heads of states there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  And here in France, there was certain consistency. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=144.88s)]
*  So I was greeted in the same way, so to say. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  Were you like texting? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=150.32s)]
*  I couldn't because they took my phone and I wasn't allowed- [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=151.72s)]
*  Like they immediately took your phone? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=154.76s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't allowed to contact anyone except for my assistant, who I asked to find me some [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=155.76s)]
*  lawyers and reach out to certain friends that I have and try to understand what was going [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=163.32s)]
*  on. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=169.44s)]
*  And then I spent four days in police custody at the building in south of Paris that is, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=171.44s)]
*  I think, run by the customs police officers or department, whatever. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=181.36s)]
*  And there I had to answer a lot of questions. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=188.16s)]
*  But you spent four days with no phone in what kind of accommodations? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=191.84s)]
*  Was a seven square meter room or a 70 square feet room, no windows, concrete block, a bed [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=198.72s)]
*  this narrow, no linen, no pillow, mattress this thing, like yoga mat this thing, maybe [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=210.68s)]
*  one centimeter, half inch. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=218.8s)]
*  And constantly blinking light, which was a bit annoying. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=221.44s)]
*  Locked door? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the door was very securely locked, I must say. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  So you're in a cell? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=231.96s)]
*  Yes, it was a solitary cell, so to say. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=233.52s)]
*  There were no other people there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=237.36s)]
*  So they put you in solitary confinement? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  You could say that, yes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=240.74s)]
*  Well, that sounds like that's what it is. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=241.74s)]
*  Well, it wasn't a prison or jail. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=243.36s)]
*  If there's a locked door, no pillow. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=246.52s)]
*  But legally speaking, it wasn't. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=248.24s)]
*  Yeah, legally speaking. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=250.68s)]
*  So legally speaking, why were you being held against your will by the French government? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=252.56s)]
*  Did you ever, in the first four days, did they make it clear to you? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=257.72s)]
*  So I understood that they were worried about the alleged lack of response from Telegram [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=262.16s)]
*  the judicial requests coming from France, which turned out to be not true because we've [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=272.98s)]
*  never received a single legally binding legal request coming from France. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=278.54s)]
*  So I was even more confused. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=284.14000000000004s)]
*  And I asked the French policeman, why haven't you been following the European law and serving [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=286.1s)]
*  your legal requests in the way prescribed by this law? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=294.56s)]
*  It's defined by the Digital Services Act. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=297.94s)]
*  It's there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=300.18s)]
*  You can Google the process. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=301.52s)]
*  You can read the privacy policy of Telegram. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=304.24s)]
*  It's easily accessible on the website. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=307.4s)]
*  So why didn't you do it? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=309.56s)]
*  And they didn't answer. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=312.08s)]
*  But thanks God they started to do it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  And then they started to receive responses helping them to identify criminal suspects, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=316.96s)]
*  meaning we would disclose IP address and phone number of people who were suspects in criminal [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=322.24s)]
*  investigations when we received court orders signed by a judge. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=330.2s)]
*  And this was something that we had in place since a year ago before that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=335.28s)]
*  So it's not something that the French have forced us to do. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=340.32s)]
*  It's something that we already had in place. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=345.32s)]
*  We had a company in Belgium processing these requests. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=347.12s)]
*  Other countries have successfully been using this process. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=350.56s)]
*  But somehow the French have ignored it completely. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=354.24s)]
*  This is why I was very surprised. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=359.24s)]
*  They said, why haven't you been doing this? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  This is the process. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  And to be clear, I think this is standard for social media companies. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  A company, whether it's Facebook or X or Snapchat or any of them, get a court order from a country [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=368.12s)]
*  in which they have users. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  And the court order says, we have reason, this person's a criminal, can we have the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=375.88s)]
*  IP address? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  I think they all comply with that, correct? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=381.76s)]
*  Well, it's the DSA law. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=382.76s)]
*  If you don't comply with it, you can be fined, you can be banned. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=384.2s)]
*  Well, it's a question of whether you want to continue providing your service in the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=389.2s)]
*  European Union. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=393.12s)]
*  But it only concerns the identification data, meaning IP address, and in some cases, phone [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=394.28s)]
*  number of the suspect. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  It has nothing to do with, for example, private messages of a person or other kinds of activity, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=405.0s)]
*  which is much more protected and much more private. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=411.48s)]
*  And if we wanted to, we wouldn't be able to disclose this information. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=413.88s)]
*  But it's not required by the law. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=417.11999999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=418.91999999999996s)]
*  But what you're describing is the state of play across Europe anyway for all the companies. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=424.96s)]
*  So, but because this is like a normal thing that's already taking its process that everyone [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=425.96s)]
*  recognizes and it's been ongoing, you must be very confused as to why you're being held [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=431.2s)]
*  in this jail that they're not calling a jail. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=436.12s)]
*  Were you confused? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=438.96s)]
*  Were you worried? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=439.96s)]
*  It was very hard to understand. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=440.96s)]
*  I got off an airplane and a bunch of cops showed up, took my phone away and threw me [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=442.08s)]
*  in the back of a car and took me to a cell, even though they pretended it was not a jail, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=446.12s)]
*  but wouldn't let me out and lock the door for four days without being able to contact [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  my family. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=453.2s)]
*  I'd be concerned. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=454.2s)]
*  Were you concerned? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  That was very surprising. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=457.88s)]
*  I was shocked. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=459.56s)]
*  You're very diplomatic. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=460.56s)]
*  You know, at first I thought there was some mistake. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=462.56s)]
*  They got the wrong guy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  I thought they read the list of charges. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=470.16s)]
*  They have nothing to do with these crimes, like organized crimes, selling drugs, all [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=473.72s)]
*  these things. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, what do I have to do with that? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  Then I realized it's serious because they're not letting me out. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  They keep me there in this cell. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=490.2s)]
*  Okay, but just for perspective, so you've got a billion users, it's a multi-billion [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=494.44s)]
*  dollar company. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=498.08s)]
*  They started the company, well, and the company is a huge company. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  It's one of the biggest social media companies in the world. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  And so there's a process. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=505.8s)]
*  And so if they think that Telegram is doing something wrong, they send letters to your [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=506.8s)]
*  general counsel or maybe get your phone number, which I'm sure they can pretty easily get. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=510.28s)]
*  French intelligence, I'm sure, has everybody's phone number, and just call you and tell you, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=513.72s)]
*  I've never heard of a CEO of a multi-billion dollar company getting arrested at the airport [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=517.72s)]
*  for, on the grounds like this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=523.56s)]
*  Well, you're very right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=526.04s)]
*  It never happened before. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=527.04s)]
*  It's like completely outrageous. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=529.0s)]
*  It's unprecedented, right? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=530.0s)]
*  It never happened. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=531.0s)]
*  So it's something that I think was very unnecessary because on top of what you just described, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=532.0s)]
*  I'm also a French citizen. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=540.68s)]
*  So in the... [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=543.12s)]
*  I know, how did you wind up, because you're not from France originally. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=544.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not from France originally, but I have certain ties to France and I was awarded, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=547.56s)]
*  so to say, this citizenship for using a specific process, which took several years, but I didn't [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=552.68s)]
*  cut any corners. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=559.76s)]
*  Like I had to pass the French exam test. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=560.76s)]
*  Like if I had to do certain things that you'd normally do. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=563.0s)]
*  Because you wanted to be a French citizen. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=567.28s)]
*  I wanted. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=569.04s)]
*  I love the country. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=570.04s)]
*  It's a great country. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=571.04s)]
*  It's a great culture. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=572.04s)]
*  Of course, these events are alarming. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=573.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's why I think it makes sense to speak about them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=576.64s)]
*  And the most interesting part of it is that every French citizen has his or her personal [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=583.88s)]
*  home address in the passport. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=590.56s)]
*  So the authorities of France know very well how to reach out to this person. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=593.36s)]
*  Like he's there or she's there. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=597.16s)]
*  And on top of that, the consulate of France is located in the same building as the telegram [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=600.28s)]
*  office in Dubai. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  So the same building. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=609.12s)]
*  The same building. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=610.72s)]
*  I've been to the building. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=611.72s)]
*  It's not a huge building, by the way. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=613.72s)]
*  Not really. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=615.88s)]
*  And it's just two floors below. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=616.88s)]
*  So two floors from the French consulate? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=618.68s)]
*  We're two floors from the French consulate. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=621.92s)]
*  And I was a frequent visitor to the consulate. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=624.84s)]
*  And whenever any French agency authority or representative of France or the government [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=627.52s)]
*  wanted to see me, they had no issue whatsoever arranging such meetings. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=634.72s)]
*  And these meetings took place. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=640.9200000000001s)]
*  I was happy just to go two floors below my office and have a conversation or invite them [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=642.72s)]
*  to our office. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  So it's very, very strange what happened because it could have been resolved by different [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=650.68s)]
*  means if you think about it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=657.04s)]
*  Well, obviously. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=659.04s)]
*  They went way out of their way to humiliate you, to issue... [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=660.04s)]
*  They announced that they arrested you. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=664.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, you were not obviously scanning Google for news stories about yourself because you [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=666.2399999999999s)]
*  couldn't. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=671.04s)]
*  I couldn't. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=672.04s)]
*  But the rest of us were. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=673.04s)]
*  And they announced we've arrested Pavel Durov and arms sales or drug sales or kiddie porn [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=674.3599999999999s)]
*  or who knows, like, horrible. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=681.04s)]
*  It's like, what? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=683.04s)]
*  So they were trying to terrify you and humiliate you, obviously. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=685.16s)]
*  This is something that was also very unusual. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=690.08s)]
*  So what my lawyers told me here in France, that normally the prosecutor's office is not [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=692.32s)]
*  that public. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=699.52s)]
*  They are not issuing press statements every day and they're not commenting on their investigations, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=700.52s)]
*  which was not the case with me, where they were very active. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=707.5200000000001s)]
*  They were trying to... [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  Have you read the... [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=712.6800000000001s)]
*  Have you gone back... [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  So you were, of course, you were locked up and you couldn't read the coverage. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=714.6800000000001s)]
*  But have you gone back and read it for those four days when you were being held? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  When I was in police custody, I heard from one of the policemen, he told me, every newspaper [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  in the world is covering this and is mentioning you. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=728.2s)]
*  And I said, what's going on? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=733.96s)]
*  He said, well, a lot of people are supportive. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=735.48s)]
*  But I asked him, what do newspapers write about this case? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=739.0400000000001s)]
*  He told me everything but truth. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  And I freaked out at that moment, like, everything but truth? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=746.32s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=750.48s)]
*  And when I went... [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=751.48s)]
*  These four days ended and I was... [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=755.6800000000001s)]
*  Can I just ask, what was your family doing? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=758.1600000000001s)]
*  And you've got children and parents and like, what were... [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=760.36s)]
*  To be honest, this is the hardest part because I'm pretty stress resilient, so I can take [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=764.2s)]
*  care of myself. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=769.64s)]
*  But being there, locked there, thinking about what's going on with my mom, you know, she's [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=771.24s)]
*  very ill, she's very elderly, she was very worried, as I learned after what's going on [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=776.5200000000001s)]
*  with my kids. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=781.96s)]
*  And this is something that gets to you. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=783.36s)]
*  And you couldn't contact them? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=786.4000000000001s)]
*  No, there's no way because you don't have access to any device or... [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=787.4000000000001s)]
*  You can't even read a newspaper. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=792.36s)]
*  What did they think was going on? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=793.8000000000001s)]
*  They were very surprised and very confused and very worried. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=796.2s)]

*  Okay. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=988.52s)]
*  Just to put a finer point on this, I mean, I'm not defending Putin, but you were arrested [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=990.52s)]
*  by the French government in the free West. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=995.72s)]
*  Did you ever kind of see the irony there? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=998.4399999999999s)]
*  That was the most unexpected place to get arrested for me because before in this trip [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1000.96s)]
*  I visited several countries. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1006.28s)]
*  Some of these countries are considered in the West to be autocratic or authoritarian. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1009.4s)]
*  But I had, and Telegram is very, very popular in these countries I visited before coming [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1016.32s)]
*  to Paris, and I had zero issues whatsoever despite the fact that Telegram does zero [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1021.84s)]
*  censorship in terms of political speech and Telegram provides 100% privacy and confidentiality [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1031.3600000000001s)]
*  to its users in all these places. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1040.04s)]
*  So you do not extract personal information from your users? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1042.96s)]
*  Unlike our company, yes. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1046.88s)]
*  We never do that. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1048.48s)]
*  But other companies, I mean, Facebook is, I mean, Meta is very rich because they extract [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1050.3600000000001s)]
*  that personal data, right? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1055.24s)]
*  That's the business model. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1056.24s)]
*  That's right, but I'm not attacking them. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1057.24s)]
*  Sorry, I am attacking them. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1059.24s)]
*  But that's what they do and you don't do that. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1061.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1063.56s)]
*  We don't have to do that. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1064.56s)]
*  We came up with ways to monetize Telegram without having to abuse people's personal [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1065.72s)]
*  data this way. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1075.4s)]
*  So Telegram became profitable last year and very profitable, more than half a billion [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1077.04s)]
*  dollars in profit without having to rely on methods like this when you have to extract [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1083.64s)]
*  personal data and then use it for targeting ads, for example. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1090.32s)]
*  We have very successful subscription, paid subscription servers on Telegram. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1096.84s)]
*  We monetize in ways that are consistent with our values. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1105.6399999999999s)]
*  They're voluntary. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1109.08s)]
*  I mean, your users have to sign up for the things that make you money, not just stealing [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1110.08s)]
*  their data from them. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1116.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1117.12s)]
*  And the service is free and we just crossed one billion monthly user threshold or milestone. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1118.32s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1127.7199999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1128.7199999999998s)]
*  So it's growing very fast and we're very happy with what we do. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1129.7199999999998s)]
*  We're very proud with what we do because if you look at any mobile messaging app right [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1132.8s)]
*  now, and we're number two after you can guess which other app, we're the second most popular [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1139.1999999999998s)]
*  messaging app in the world. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1144.56s)]
*  But most of the features that you use on a modern messaging app first appeared, first [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1147.5s)]
*  were created by Telegram and then they were borrowed. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1154.1s)]
*  We came up with a list of like 100 such features and those are not like small things. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1156.74s)]
*  Those are basic things that you know in every modern messaging app, like the way you respond [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1161.3s)]
*  to messages, the way you share links, the way you share documents, the text formatting, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1170.14s)]
*  many, many, many, many things, like dozens of those first appeared on Telegram and then [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1175.46s)]
*  three to eight years after they've been copied by our rivals, one of which is larger than [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1181.02s)]
*  Telegram and others are smaller. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1189.7s)]
*  But still we are proud. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1191.82s)]
*  I'm not going to guess. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1193.1000000000001s)]
*  The green one. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1194.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1195.1000000000001s)]
*  But we are proud that we've been able to shape what the industry is like today and define [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1196.1000000000001s)]
*  how billions of people communicate. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1203.98s)]
*  But it's just, I'm just going back to this story, which is, by the way, I love your Slavic [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1205.98s)]
*  deadpan approach to this. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1211.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like, it's crazy. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1212.74s)]
*  I mean, if Mark Zuckerberg or Elon got grabbed, you know, at the private part of DeGaul Airport, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1214.54s)]
*  you'd be like, stop them. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1222.58s)]
*  Like, what? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1223.98s)]
*  The world is ending. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1225.06s)]
*  But they grabbed you and be like, oh, he's got a Russian last name. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1226.98s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1229.58s)]
*  I'm sure it's a good reason. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1230.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1232.34s)]
*  I hope it had nothing to do with my ethnicity because that- [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1233.8999999999999s)]
*  Of course it did. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1238.98s)]
*  Are you joking? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1239.98s)]
*  That would be very alarming because- [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1240.98s)]
*  You got run out of Russia, by the way. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1243.3799999999999s)]
*  I just want to say that again. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1244.9399999999998s)]
*  You got run out. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1245.9399999999998s)]
*  You'd probably still be living there if you hadn't had to leave. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1246.9399999999998s)]
*  So it's clear you didn't participate in whatever they're mad about in Russia. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1249.02s)]
*  You're gone. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1252.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1253.1399999999999s)]
*  But it still can make you an easier target. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1254.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm aware of that. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1256.3799999999999s)]
*  Because people don't know my story. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1257.72s)]
*  Not everybody watched our last interview and not everybody had it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1260.1399999999999s)]
*  Where was the- [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1264.3799999999999s)]
*  So I was- [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1265.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, I know you and obviously I like you. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  And I like what you're doing. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1268.4199999999998s)]
*  I like your commitment to privacy and to the user. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1269.8999999999999s)]
*  And I think the user's- [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1272.34s)]
*  Privacy should play a role in your thinking about a business. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1274.8999999999999s)]
*  And that's my view. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1277.62s)]
*  And you agree. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1278.78s)]
*  Most companies don't agree. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1279.78s)]
*  So I'm on your side. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1280.78s)]
*  But where were all the civil libertarians jumping to your defense? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1282.1799999999998s)]
*  Like, can you just grab someone at the airport? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1285.26s)]
*  Because who knows why? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1287.5s)]
*  Can you just do that? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1289.9s)]
*  Put him in jail for four days? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1290.9s)]
*  Take his phone? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1292.3s)]
*  Where were your defenders? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1293.3s)]
*  Well, to be fair, some people did- [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1295.66s)]
*  Yeah, some did. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1300.06s)]
*  ... speak up and defended me. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1301.06s)]
*  And I actually, there were more than 10 million or more than, I think, a very big number of [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1304.34s)]
*  people who signed a petition to free me. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1309.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1313.26s)]
*  It was a very, very large movement. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1314.26s)]
*  I received those- [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1318.22s)]
*  But I'm thinking more like the United Nations human rights watchdogs. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1319.22s)]
*  Like where are they? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1322.34s)]
*  If this happened in North Korea, which I don't know, it hasn't, so. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1324.18s)]
*  But if it happened there, we'd be like, oh my gosh, it's Stalinism. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1330.7s)]
*  But it happens in France. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1333.02s)]
*  And you're like, oh, I'm sure there's a good reason. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1334.02s)]
*  That's what makes the situation so complicated, because we have to look at the instances such [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1339.26s)]
*  as this one, regardless of which jurisdiction I was born in, which jurisdiction is conducting [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1346.7s)]
*  this investigation. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1357.3s)]
*  It should be completely unbiased, right? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1358.3s)]
*  So it's very concerning. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1363.54s)]
*  Did they ask you questions about Russia during your four days of detainment? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1368.22s)]
*  I think so, but it wasn't the focus of their questioning. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1372.7s)]
*  The most questions were about the way Telgram operates, as if it's some kind of mystery. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1378.3799999999999s)]
*  We are a big company. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1385.74s)]
*  We are audited by a big firm. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1386.94s)]
*  We work with the biggest financial institutions. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1393.02s)]
*  So we're a big company. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1395.18s)]
*  We spend millions of dollars every quarter on legal compliance. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1396.8999999999999s)]
*  So we pay to law firms to receive the best advice in order to make sure we don't violate [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1402.82s)]
*  laws anywhere and we operate in almost 200 countries. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1408.5s)]
*  So it was very, very surprising for me to get detained in Paris and learn that Telgram [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1413.18s)]
*  did something wrong or didn't process some requests. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1420.58s)]
*  And then when I learned more about it, I realized that we did actually nothing wrong because [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1425.26s)]
*  the law is very clear in describing the process that should be followed in order for this [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1431.1s)]
*  request to be processed. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1438.66s)]
*  And it wasn't followed. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1440.26s)]
*  And that's something that French prosecutors could have found out in about six minutes, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1442.26s)]
*  obviously. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1446.34s)]
*  That's the irony of it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1447.34s)]
*  You could Google Telgram police contact, Telgram EU corporation, whatever, and it would be [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1449.1s)]
*  instantly visible online for anybody who has access to Google. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1455.74s)]
*  For some reason, it wasn't used. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1460.1399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1463.98s)]
*  And you have to think that there's a reason. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1464.98s)]
*  Before I ask about that, how was the food in French prison, by the way? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1467.1s)]
*  I think they made some exception in relation to food for me. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1472.58s)]
*  So it was fine. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1475.82s)]
*  I was fine. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1476.82s)]
*  I was pretty good. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1477.86s)]
*  I, you know, I don't eat meat. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1478.86s)]
*  I don't eat fast food. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1480.54s)]
*  So I was good with enough fish and I could do my 200 push-ups in the morning, like 200 [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1482.54s)]
*  squats. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1492.5s)]
*  And then I repeated it because I didn't have access to a gym. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1493.5s)]
*  So I kept my routine there. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1495.98s)]
*  Did you join a gang? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1498.6599999999999s)]
*  No, I was alone there. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1499.6599999999999s)]
*  You were alone. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1501.6599999999999s)]
*  You had push-ups in your cell. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1502.6599999999999s)]
*  That's just the whole thing is incredible. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1505.6599999999999s)]
*  Where does it stand now? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1508.5s)]
*  You know, we're in, I should say we're in France right now. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1509.5s)]
*  You're still in France. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1513.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm still in France. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1514.3400000000001s)]
*  Many, many months later. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1515.3400000000001s)]
*  Almost eight months. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1517.3400000000001s)]
*  Eight months later, you're still in France. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1518.3400000000001s)]
*  Why are you still here? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1521.98s)]
*  So there is this limitation on my travel, traveling ability, so to say, which is called [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1524.1000000000001s)]
*  judicial control. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1532.8200000000002s)]
*  Judicial control is when you can't leave the country freely because there is still investigation [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1535.7s)]
*  going on and you're one of the suspects or the suspect. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1540.38s)]
*  I was still being allowed to go to Dubai and I returned last week from Dubai and I will [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1543.7s)]
*  be going to Dubai later this week, but it's a very, very restricted controlled process [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1552.78s)]
*  still. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1559.8200000000002s)]
*  And what's the idea there, since you own a multi-billion dollar company with a billion [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1561.8999999999999s)]
*  users that's really famous? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1565.98s)]
*  Where would you go on planet Earth if you were going to run away? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1567.98s)]
*  That's exactly the source of my misunderstanding and my confusion here. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1571.3s)]
*  I'm not running anywhere. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1576.86s)]
*  I've been to Dubai, came back, so it's very hard for me to understand my role in being [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1578.86s)]
*  here because I'm required to answer some questions in relation to Telegram every fifth month [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1584.26s)]
*  or fourth month. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1591.3s)]
*  So the other three or four months, I'm just having to be here for reasons that are very [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1592.4199999999998s)]
*  hard for me to understand. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1601.02s)]
*  What's their argument? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1603.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm just confused. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1604.3799999999999s)]
*  So no one's actually, despite the headlines that flooded the world in August when you [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1605.3799999999999s)]
*  were arrested, detained, whatever they're calling it, put in a cell, you were not involved [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1610.1399999999999s)]
*  in kiddie porn, drug sales, organized crime, arms sales. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1616.26s)]
*  I can't even remember, but like the worst crimes in the world, no one is actually claiming [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1620.54s)]
*  you were involved in those crimes, correct? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1624.74s)]
*  Correct. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1626.8999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1627.8999999999999s)]
*  They're saying that you had, of your billion users, there were a few who may have been [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1628.8999999999999s)]
*  doing bad things, and you're saying, I tried, but I didn't know that. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1632.42s)]
*  It's not my fault, right? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1636.94s)]
*  Correct. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1638.98s)]
*  It'd be like saying to Donald Trump, there are 350 million people in America, one third [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1639.98s)]
*  the number of users you have, and some of them are using kiddie porn or selling drugs [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1644.8999999999999s)]
*  or something, you know, organized crime, and we're putting you in jail for it. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1649.42s)]
*  I mean, that's like insane. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1652.8600000000001s)]
*  So why are you still here? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1654.7s)]
*  What is the claim against you? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1656.9s)]
*  I'm still trying to find out, to be honest. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1660.38s)]
*  I'm still confused. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1663.18s)]
*  So at first they said, oh, you failed to respond to our legal request, and that's why you're [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1664.26s)]
*  complicit. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1670.5s)]
*  But first of all, it's not true that we didn't respond to legally binding legal requests. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1672.5s)]
*  And secondly, it's a very extensive interpretation of complicity, even for the French legal and [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1678.14s)]
*  judicial system. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1690.9s)]
*  What I hear from my lawyers is that it's quite unprecedented. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1694.0600000000002s)]
*  They had a couple of really small niche apps that are like 10,000 smaller than Telegram [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1697.26s)]
*  and were targeted specifically at criminals. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1703.38s)]
*  They were nothing like that. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1707.62s)]
*  They didn't even have these companies, they didn't even have bank accounts. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1708.62s)]
*  It was a different profile. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1713.9799999999998s)]
*  They were not audited by Big Four organization. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1715.54s)]
*  But these companies have been persecuted in France before, and their founders, I understand, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1720.9399999999998s)]
*  were accused of running a platform that is created for the purpose to facilitate crime. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1731.78s)]
*  It's pretty much obvious that Telegram is not such a company, right? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1740.66s)]
*  So it has a billion users, every eighth person on the planet is a user of Telegram, a regular [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1744.62s)]
*  one. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1752.86s)]
*  And it's incomprehensible to assume that all these people are criminals. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1753.86s)]
*  And you know, everybody knows the story of Telegram very well. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1759.82s)]
*  It's not something that was built for criminals. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1762.02s)]
*  However, this reasoning, as far as I understand, is being used also in our case. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1765.46s)]
*  They say that, all right, so you created this app, and this app was used by other people. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1773.7s)]
*  They were criminals, and you didn't do enough to prevent them from doing what they were [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1782.34s)]
*  doing. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1788.3799999999999s)]
*  Which, again, is contrary to what we see on other platforms. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1789.3799999999999s)]
*  You have instances where problematic content exists despite the best efforts of social [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1795.78s)]
*  media platforms, moderation teams, and so on and so forth. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1803.98s)]
*  It's almost impossible to avoid that. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1807.74s)]
*  The claim itself just conceptually doesn't make sense. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1812.02s)]
*  I mean, if someone commits armed robbery in Burgundy or Toulouse or Nice, can President [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1814.38s)]
*  Macron be arrested for that? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1819.42s)]
*  Because it's his country, he runs the country, and he didn't do enough to stop the armed [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1821.22s)]
*  robbery in Toulouse. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1825.38s)]
*  Like, how can that stand? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1826.38s)]
*  Why isn't he in jail? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1827.98s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1830.98s)]
*  Well, the logic also eludes me, so to say. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1831.98s)]
*  Back with the Russian understatement. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1837.42s)]
*  So, look, here's the inescapable conclusion, I think, from a bystander's perspective, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1840.0600000000002s)]
*  that they do this in public rather than just calling you, so we have a problem, we work [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1845.42s)]
*  it out, or call your lawyers. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1848.74s)]
*  They arrest you in public, they slander you, they try and tie you to the worst crimes a [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1850.98s)]
*  man commits, and then they put you in jail. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1855.94s)]
*  And so they're trying to sweat you, to intimidate you, to wear you down in order to get into [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1860.5400000000002s)]
*  the back door of telegrams. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1867.8600000000001s)]
*  And they can spy on people, probably really for political reasons. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1870.06s)]
*  What they're really worried about is a revolt in their own country. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1873.4599999999998s)]
*  Every government's really worried mostly about its own population revolting against its bad [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1875.98s)]
*  governance, like that's their real fear. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1880.26s)]
*  And they hate telegram because it offers users privacy, and that's a threat to them. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1882.78s)]
*  And so they force you, as the owner of the company, to give them the keys. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1888.06s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1892.06s)]
*  Well, to be clear, nobody approached me with the demand to give the so-called keys. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1893.22s)]
*  Such keys don't exist, technically, but if somebody approaches me and says, we need the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1899.3799999999999s)]
*  keys, you'll be among the first to learn about it. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1904.06s)]
*  But that hasn't happened. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1908.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, actually, the US government pushed you. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1909.46s)]
*  I remember the FBI was trying to... [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1911.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1913.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1914.5s)]
*  Because this is something governments want, not just of you, but of all social media companies. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1915.5s)]
*  You know what's interesting? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1918.6599999999999s)]
*  In the US, you have a process that allows the government to actually force any engineer [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1919.66s)]
*  in any tech company to implement a backdoor and not tell anyone about it, using this process [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1928.8600000000001s)]
*  called the gag order. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1934.6200000000001s)]
*  There are certain legal procedures. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1937.1000000000001s)]
*  And not tell his own employer about it? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1938.1000000000001s)]
*  And net... [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1939.98s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1940.98s)]
*  If you tell your own boss, you can end up in jail, like gag order. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1941.98s)]
*  This is... [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1945.94s)]
*  Actually? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1946.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1947.94s)]
*  This is Wikipedia. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1948.94s)]
*  In France... [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1950.5800000000002s)]
*  In the Soviet Union or in the US? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1951.5800000000002s)]
*  In the US. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1953.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1954.66s)]
*  I'm not criticizing... [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1955.66s)]
*  So your employees have a legal obligation to act as fifth column spies, saboteurs against [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1958.66s)]
*  you, your employees. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1966.18s)]
*  Well, that's one of the reasons we didn't discuss last time why I didn't move to the [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1967.18s)]
*  US with my team. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1972.98s)]
*  And you got mugged in San Francisco on your one trip there. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1973.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1976.74s)]
*  But I did this extensive legal analysis. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1978.54s)]
*  I asked my lawyers, the US lawyers, what is this thing called the gag order? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1980.86s)]
*  And they explained it to me and how it works and how it could potentially be applied. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1984.94s)]
*  So we decided maybe not the best place for a privacy-oriented platform. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1989.78s)]
*  But here in France, we really don't know because there are a lot of conspiracy theories about [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=1995.34s)]
*  it. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2000.78s)]
*  At first, I thought I also started to be concerned. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2001.78s)]
*  What is this about? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2004.24s)]
*  But then when the French police and the French judges started to send their requests in accordance [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2005.74s)]
*  to the European law, to Telegram, and receive their identification data, I mean, the IP [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2012.94s)]
*  address of criminal suspects, they seemed to become very happy. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2019.18s)]
*  They expressed their joy in the press. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2023.7s)]
*  They said, oh, Telegram is now cooperating. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2028.22s)]
*  All of a sudden, as if it was something new. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2029.78s)]
*  Can I ask you to pause? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2033.46s)]
*  When they said that, I remember that very well. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2034.5800000000002s)]
*  That sounded to me like they were trying to discredit you and were sending the message [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2038.46s)]
*  because they were not specific. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2044.14s)]
*  They said they're cooperating. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2045.14s)]
*  And that made it sound to the rest of the world like, oh, they broke Pavel. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2047.46s)]
*  They hung him by his ankles and burned him with Galois until he finally gave up and turned [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2051.6600000000003s)]
*  over the back end to them. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2056.1s)]
*  And now they're spying on all Telegram users. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2058.46s)]
*  They're cooperating like you would in East Germany in 1975. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2060.38s)]
*  That's what it sounded like. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2064.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's why it's so important to clarify this because this perception is not only bad [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2065.46s)]
*  for Telegram, it's even worse for the image of France. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2070.7000000000003s)]
*  If you think about it, France is still a land where laws and legal procedures should be [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2074.86s)]
*  adhered to. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2082.5s)]
*  And even in this case, if you want additional access to certain data, personal data, it [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2084.06s)]
*  has to be done in accordance with laws. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2091.86s)]
*  And then every company, for example, us, we never disclose private messaging data to any [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2094.2s)]
*  third party, including governments. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2098.62s)]
*  And if it's in some country, they would say you have to do it, we would discontinue providing [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2100.7s)]
*  services in that country, then doing it. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2106.34s)]
*  Isn't that why you left Russia in the first place? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2108.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2110.86s)]
*  So you've been through this. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2111.86s)]
*  You left your own country because you refused to give up the privacy of the user. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2113.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2118.94s)]
*  But here it's catching up because last month, the Senate here in France passed a law basically [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2119.94s)]
*  banning encryption. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2127.86s)]
*  This law was forcing all messaging app providers to implement the backdoor for the French law [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2130.1800000000003s)]
*  enforcement to fight crime. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2137.98s)]
*  The problem here was, well, exactly, because the problem here was there is no such thing [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2141.58s)]
*  as an exclusive backdoor. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2146.66s)]
*  If you implement the backdoor, technically, other actors are able to exploit it. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2148.2200000000003s)]
*  And it could be foreign agents, it could be hackers, it could be anyone. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2156.02s)]
*  So that law would have put millions of people or tens of millions of French citizens in [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2159.34s)]
*  danger. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2167.86s)]
*  So private messages would have been exposed. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2169.26s)]
*  The criminals, however, would have instantly switched to niche smaller apps, not mainstream [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2173.02s)]
*  apps. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2180.06s)]
*  And if the government would try to ban these apps, they would switch to VPNs. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2181.06s)]
*  They would even become more efficient in hiding their traces. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2186.82s)]
*  So the criminals would experience zero problems if that law is passed. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2190.1400000000003s)]
*  It's the law abiding citizens who would be affected. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2197.46s)]
*  And that's why it's so problematic. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2201.98s)]
*  And nobody was talking about it. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2203.58s)]
*  I asked my French friends, like, have you heard about this law? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2204.98s)]
*  Like, they know. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2208.2200000000003s)]
*  They were completely unaware. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2210.06s)]
*  And luckily, the National Assembly here in France shot that bill down. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2212.62s)]
*  So it didn't pass this time. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2218.88s)]
*  But if you look at the new project by the EU, by the European Commission, published [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2221.3s)]
*  in early April, they again want to do exactly that, to backdoor encryption, but now on the [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2228.2400000000002s)]
*  EU level. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2236.86s)]
*  And that raises many serious questions because no country in the world banned encryption [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2238.82s)]
*  so far. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2245.1000000000004s)]
*  Even the places that you would consider authoritarian places, for reasons that I just described, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2246.1000000000004s)]
*  it's just a huge threat for the entire population. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2251.82s)]
*  For all users. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2255.1000000000004s)]
*  For all users to legally force companies to implement backdoors. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2256.5400000000004s)]
*  So I think it's very important that people talk about these things. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2262.2200000000003s)]
*  First of all, that France is not a country where freedoms are disrespected. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2267.3s)]
*  For example, if people assume that France can now take CEOs of tech companies hostage [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2275.46s)]
*  in such a way that you describe, and then extract certain personal data from them using [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2284.54s)]
*  illegal and unlawful processes, that would be a big, big blow for the image of France. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2292.96s)]
*  But I don't think we are there. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2298.7400000000002s)]
*  You might chip away at this concept of the rules-based order. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2301.06s)]
*  The rules-based order, which everyone in NATO is always lecturing everybody else about. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2306.62s)]
*  The rules-based order. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2310.06s)]
*  There's nothing rules-based about what they did to you. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2311.06s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2313.98s)]
*  I mean, that's just, that's might makes right. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2314.98s)]
*  We have guns and you don't. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2317.2799999999997s)]
*  It's our airport, not yours. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2318.66s)]
*  You're going to jail. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2320.1s)]
*  I just don't see the legal justification for doing this to anybody. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2321.1s)]
*  It was excessive in my view. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2326.62s)]
*  But it was also a sign that, again, in my view, this investigation was not based on [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2330.58s)]
*  thorough analysis of what Telegram represents and what the goals of the company are. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2339.74s)]
*  And again, there has been no attempt and they had, didn't even try to solve this in a more [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2346.5s)]
*  traditional conventional way before starting. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2356.34s)]
*  A legal way, actually. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2359.6600000000003s)]
*  A legal and diplomatic way. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2360.6600000000003s)]
*  What did they do with your phone? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2363.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, they just kept my phone. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2364.1400000000003s)]
*  I hope they scrutinize it because there they have a lot of proof that actually Telegram [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2366.02s)]
*  is a completely legitimate and compliant organization. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2373.78s)]
*  And we've spent huge funds on content moderation and legal compliance all over the world since [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2378.02s)]
*  like 10 years ago. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2385.42s)]
*  So they're welcome to have my phone. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2386.98s)]
*  Who sold your bonds? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2388.82s)]
*  Yeah, so Telegram issued bonds a few years ago. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2391.0200000000004s)]
*  We were happy to have the assistance of JP Morgan, the world's biggest bank. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2396.0200000000004s)]
*  World's biggest bank. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2404.26s)]
*  So I only asked, I knew that and I just wanted you to say it because just to underscore the [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2405.26s)]
*  point, you're not like some, you know, Belorussian college student doing this out of your room [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2408.98s)]
*  or something. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2414.62s)]
*  This is like a worldwide huge company. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2415.62s)]
*  It's just absolutely crazy. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2417.58s)]
*  And it doesn't have as deep penetration in the United States as it does in the rest of [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2419.46s)]
*  the world. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2423.22s)]
*  So I just want people to know this is not some sketchy deal. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2424.22s)]
*  This is like, I can't just believe they did that. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2428.62s)]
*  Where are you now in the process? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2432.66s)]
*  So the process is not going too fast, but this is the tradition here in France. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2435.9s)]
*  So I'm not... [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2443.62s)]
*  I'm just visiting for a couple of days. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2444.62s)]
*  Do you think I'll get out of here? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2447.2999999999997s)]
*  So I haven't been granted a fast track in my case. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2450.18s)]
*  And you know, I've just seen my investigative judges. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2458.38s)]
*  They have this role of investigative judges here in France. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2463.14s)]
*  So my current status is I'm not on trial. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2468.7s)]
*  It's an investigation intended to find out whether there'll be enough evidence to put [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2473.5s)]
*  this on trial. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2481.9s)]
*  So I'm not even on trial yet. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2483.22s)]
*  But you're basically imprisoned in France. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2484.54s)]
*  But I... [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2486.7s)]
*  Well, I'm not in prison, but... [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2487.7s)]
*  Can you leave whenever you want? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2489.02s)]
*  I can't leave France freely. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2491.5s)]
*  That's true. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2493.14s)]
*  So what... [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2494.7s)]
*  How is that not imprisoned? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2495.7s)]
*  I mean, there are great restaurants. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2496.7s)]
*  I'm not... [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2501.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2502.02s)]
*  You're a commissary with guys with face tattoos, but if you can't leave, then aren't you by [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2503.54s)]
*  definition imprisoned? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2507.5s)]
*  You could say so. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2508.98s)]
*  I just don't want to create this image of a real prison in the minds of our viewers. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2511.18s)]
*  This is... [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2515.98s)]
*  I don't know if anyone can see the cell we're in. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2516.98s)]
*  It's very nice. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2517.98s)]
*  Room service and everything. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2518.98s)]
*  I mean, no, it's France. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2519.98s)]
*  It's like very first world in some ways, but not in its attitudes, I'm learning. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2520.98s)]
*  So how long will that continue? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2526.98s)]
*  And you've got children, you know, and a life and a business and friends and family, and [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2528.54s)]
*  they're not in France, so far as I know. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2535.3s)]
*  So... [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2537.02s)]
*  Yes, they're all in Dubai, and I have kids in Dubai that I am unable to not just see. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2538.02s)]
*  I'm unable to legally take care of them by signing certain documents I have to sign. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2545.38s)]
*  It's been very stressful for my mom, who is gravely ill, and I can't see her. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2552.58s)]
*  I also have this company to run. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2564.06s)]
*  We have a billion users. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2566.18s)]
*  It's important. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2568.74s)]
*  And I'm doing it remotely now, but it's not as efficient. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2570.38s)]
*  So if you think about it, France is less than 1% of the Telegram user base. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2573.74s)]
*  It's something like half of 1%. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2580.8199999999997s)]
*  And the other 99.5% are coming from elsewhere, right? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2585.7s)]
*  India, Indonesia, you name it. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2589.58s)]
*  And it's kind of counterintuitive for me that the entire organization is impacted because [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2592.3399999999997s)]
*  we have this ongoing investigation here in France, particularly given the fact that it's [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2601.74s)]
*  growing in a pace that only requires me to be here once in several months. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2607.74s)]
*  So I do think that the current restriction is very strange and very unnecessary, and [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2616.02s)]
*  I hope it will be lifted later this year. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2623.02s)]
*  And if it's not? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2626.9s)]
*  Your identity is constantly under attack, and just the last year, Americans lost over [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2628.58s)]
*  $16 billion to scammers online. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2632.38s)]
*  And the second they are exposed, thieves can take out loans to your name, open credit cards, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2636.1800000000003s)]

*  Well, let's see because first of all, this investigation can't last forever. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2758.74s)]
*  It can probably last for another several months or a year and then it will have to either [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2763.06s)]
*  go on trial or be concluded. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2768.02s)]
*  You could be criminally charged for this? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2773.02s)]
*  Everything is possible. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2776.22s)]

*  Yes, if they'd arrested you at the airport, they'd do anything, right? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2778.8199999999997s)]
*  That's what bothered me when I was in police custody for these four days. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2782.58s)]
*  First thing, something like this should have never happened because I assumed there were [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2788.4199999999996s)]
*  certain thorough procedures to verify a lot of alleged facts before taking a decision [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2793.62s)]
*  such as this. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2802.7799999999997s)]
*  You can't start something like this based on a media article that Telegram allegedly [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2804.18s)]
*  is non-cooperative or that Telegram supposedly has worse content moderation than other platforms. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2809.7s)]
*  Both these facts turned out to be completely false. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2819.74s)]
*  You have to be really thorough and examine things before making this decision because [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2823.62s)]
*  decisions such as this are not only harmful for my relatives or for my company or for [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2829.4199999999996s)]
*  me personally. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2836.3399999999997s)]
*  Decisions such as this, I think, impact France as a whole. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2838.22s)]
*  I'm a French citizen, so I worry about that as well. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2842.46s)]
*  I really think that out of all social media platforms, Telegram was probably the most [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2845.54s)]
*  friendly potential partner for France. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2852.02s)]
*  Every time anyone from the French government, from the French authorities reached out to [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2858.74s)]
*  me, I did my best to help them. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2863.62s)]
*  This for me looked almost like friendly fire. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2868.66s)]
*  They're trying to attack their own ally in a way. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2873.3s)]
*  I was so surprised that this would happen because the collateral damage, not just for [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2879.02s)]
*  me and my company, but for the image of France, is quite significant. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2886.06s)]
*  I talked to many of my friends, the CEO of big tech companies, and they were very concerned [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2890.78s)]
*  and asked me, can I still come to France? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2897.46s)]
*  Is it still safe to be in France? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2901.34s)]
*  People were worried. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2904.54s)]
*  The CEOs of smaller companies, they don't have a billion users. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2906.06s)]
*  I'm even more worried. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2909.7s)]
*  They say, look, they did this to you and you're very well known and the company of your profile [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2910.82s)]
*  should be treated in a certain different way. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2918.38s)]
*  I'm running a small startup, a friend of mine would say, I'm scared to come. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2923.3s)]
*  This trend continues. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2929.7s)]
*  The sad thing is nobody's afraid to go to Uzbekistan, actually. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2931.5s)]
*  I'm not endorsing Uzbekistan, I've never been there, but I've never met anyone who's [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2937.2599999999998s)]
*  like, I'm too afraid to go to Uzbekistan. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2940.9s)]
*  I was there last summer, it was great. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2943.5s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2945.38s)]
*  I didn't even know that. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2946.38s)]
*  But that's the point. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2947.38s)]
*  These countries that you grew up thinking are primitive or don't have functioning legal [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2950.3s)]
*  systems or whose laws are really a function of the whim of the monarch or whatever, they [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2954.34s)]
*  turn out to be kind of fine with what you do or what I do or what any normal person [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2959.9s)]
*  who believes in human rights does, but it's like France or Great Britain. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2966.2200000000003s)]
*  Didn't you get citizenship here thinking this was a safe haven as someone who was in some [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2970.42s)]
*  sense kind of a refugee from his own country, a refugee principle, like I don't want to [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2975.06s)]
*  share this with the government, I'm leaving. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2979.5s)]
*  Didn't you choose this country for citizenship because you thought that it was a place that [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2982.1400000000003s)]
*  was committed to human rights? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2985.9s)]
*  Well, the slogan of France is liberty, fraternity, equality, right? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2988.7799999999997s)]
*  So equality. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2994.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2995.14s)]
*  So it's something that I strongly believe in. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2996.14s)]
*  And it's certainly something that France stands for in my opinion. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=2999.14s)]
*  And for pretty much everybody who was born in the Soviet Union, like I was, Western Europe [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3007.86s)]
*  is considered to be this place where freedoms and human rights are respected. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3015.94s)]
*  And that's why it was such a shock for me back there in the police custody. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3021.7400000000002s)]
*  Interestingly, the interpreter that we had during these four days in police custody also [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3031.2200000000003s)]
*  emigrated from the Soviet Union. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3038.1s)]
*  She was translating English to French and back. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3039.98s)]
*  And after being present there for two days, she said during a break with all the policemen [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3043.94s)]
*  and clerks and everybody present there, she said, I left the Soviet Union hoping I would [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3052.6600000000003s)]
*  be in a country with freedoms. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3064.02s)]
*  And it seems now that the Soviet Union has caught up with me. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3068.3s)]
*  And I've, so I was very surprised to hear her say that because for me, France is not [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3074.34s)]
*  there yet. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3080.98s)]
*  France is still the country that respects human rights and freedoms. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3081.98s)]
*  However I understood, I later understood why she was so sensitive to this because she actually [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3086.1000000000004s)]
*  experienced what life is like in an environment where you don't have freedom of speech and [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3091.7s)]
*  you don't have a free market economy. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3100.18s)]
*  And that's why every perceived change for, in this direction where freedoms are less [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3103.2999999999997s)]
*  respected is taking very, is making them very, very concerned, people from the Soviet Union. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3111.74s)]
*  And I myself, I remember my life, I was a small kid in the Soviet Union, but I remember [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3119.14s)]
*  having all these three TV channels and all these three TV channels show the same TV program [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3124.8199999999997s)]
*  about the Communist Party. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3132.86s)]
*  I remember having two kinds of ice cream in the shops across the city and across the country [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3134.66s)]
*  and no more. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3141.06s)]
*  And then when I was brought to Italy as a five-year-old kid and I could see, okay, actually [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3142.06s)]
*  I could have 100 TV channels and some of them even show Disney cartoons and Japanese anime. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3147.98s)]
*  That's great. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3156.34s)]
*  I can go to a shop downstairs and they have 200 different kinds of ice cream. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3157.34s)]
*  That's much better than they experienced in the Soviet Union. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3163.86s)]
*  And I thought maybe these things afterwards I realized that these systems called the free [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3166.34s)]
*  market economy and respect to freedom of speech and basic human rights, they're actually very [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3172.54s)]
*  good concepts because they make your life abundant. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3177.74s)]
*  But the problem is I remember this life in the absence of these things. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3180.3399999999997s)]
*  Other people from the Soviet Union, probably from Cuba, from other countries like that, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3187.9399999999996s)]
*  experienced that. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3193.4199999999996s)]
*  But people who were born and grew up here, for example in France, have not necessarily [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3194.4199999999996s)]
*  had this experience. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3198.8199999999997s)]
*  They take freedoms for granted. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3200.4199999999996s)]
*  They think that things are going to be fine because we're a free country and what can [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3201.9399999999996s)]
*  possibly go wrong? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3206.18s)]
*  Unfortunately the history knows many examples when free societies gradually degraded into [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3208.2999999999997s)]
*  societies without freedoms. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3216.34s)]
*  And one good example was last month with this anti-encryption law I told you before about [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3218.62s)]
*  because people were completely ignorant here in France. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3225.7799999999997s)]
*  The public was completely ignorant. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3228.42s)]
*  So no encryption means no privacy. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3230.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3232.7799999999997s)]
*  Correct. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3233.7799999999997s)]
*  Everybody's vulnerable. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3234.82s)]
*  Everybody's messages can leak. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3236.7400000000002s)]
*  It's mind boggling. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3240.34s)]
*  And of course every time something like this is proposed, very logically sounding justifications [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3242.42s)]
*  are used. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3250.5800000000004s)]
*  What's to protect the children? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3251.5800000000004s)]
*  To protect the children, to fight crime, to... [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3252.5800000000004s)]
*  Neither of which they bother doing, by the way. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3256.42s)]
*  They don't care about children and they don't stop crime. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3258.7000000000003s)]
*  Or in the Soviet Union they would say, like Maoist China and other places, they would [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3262.18s)]
*  say, oh, our geopolitical rival is trying to stir chaos in our country so we have to [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3266.02s)]
*  limit this. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3271.22s)]
*  It's Qatar doing it. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3273.22s)]
*  It's Russia. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3274.74s)]
*  It's Qatar. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3275.74s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't know. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3276.74s)]
*  But it's always some Trotskyite wreckers, it's some unseen force from a foreign land [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3279.74s)]
*  trying to wreck our project so we need to oppress you to keep you safe. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3285.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3289.94s)]
*  But it's not easy because now in the European Union you have all these laws that basically [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3291.22s)]
*  say you have to remove anything. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3297.62s)]
*  It's actually part of the Digital Services Act. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3301.06s)]
*  You have to remove anything one of the European countries demands you remove for the entirety [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3303.2599999999998s)]
*  of the European Union. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3312.2599999999998s)]
*  So if you have, for example, Romania or Estonia or any other of these very highly respected [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3313.78s)]
*  countries demanding that you remove most of the telegram channels for whatever reason, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3321.6600000000003s)]
*  you have to remove them. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3328.82s)]
*  Then you can appeal. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3330.7400000000002s)]
*  Well it will take you probably several years. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3332.7000000000003s)]
*  But you have to remove them within a very short timeframe. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3335.42s)]
*  Otherwise you'll be facing fines, bans and so on. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3340.38s)]
*  How is it not the Warsaw Pact? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3345.2200000000003s)]
*  How is it not Soviet? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3347.02s)]
*  If you criticize the people in charge, we shut you down. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3348.02s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3350.98s)]
*  Interesting you would say that. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3353.26s)]
*  It was in 2009, 2008 actually, I made my first trip to Latvia on a train from St. Petersburg [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3354.5s)]
*  and something was wrong with my visa so I had to get off in the border town in Latvia. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3366.7000000000003s)]
*  But I had this long discussion with a border police officer. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3372.94s)]
*  Well I seem to like border policemen. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3376.26s)]
*  So border police officer in Latvia and I started to discuss his life in Latvia after Latvia [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3379.94s)]
*  was accepted in the EU. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3385.98s)]
*  And he told me this interesting thing. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3387.62s)]
*  He said, you know we hated being in the Soviet Union, but now that we are in the EU we realize [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3390.82s)]
*  we are in a very similar organization. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3399.42s)]
*  Of course. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3403.34s)]
*  We're in the Soviet Union again. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3404.34s)]
*  Unelected foreigners are still making the key decisions and you don't get to talk. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3405.9s)]
*  So it's very funny you would compare this to systems. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3410.6600000000003s)]
*  Of course they're very different. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3413.5s)]
*  But still. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3415.38s)]
*  But fundamentally if you're not allowed to criticize the people in charge, you live in [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3416.38s)]
*  a tyranny. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3420.66s)]
*  I mean what's the other definition of it? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3421.66s)]
*  I have to be able to say to the person making the decisions, I don't like that decision [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3425.14s)]
*  and here's why. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3429.42s)]
*  And I have to be able to say it in public. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3430.42s)]
*  I've always felt the problem that you have as the person who owns and runs Telegram is [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3432.3799999999997s)]
*  that you make it easy for people to come together online. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3437.7s)]
*  You have the channels. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3440.8199999999997s)]
*  And that is, I don't know if you thought this through when you're an engineer, when you [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3442.7s)]
*  But that is potentially a massive threat to governments. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3447.18s)]
*  Because it's not simply communicating one on one. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3451.22s)]
*  People can create their own channels, just like a TV channel, and reach a lot of like-minded [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3455.02s)]
*  people and they could potentially organize. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3459.46s)]
*  That's true. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3463.3399999999997s)]
*  But one thing that makes Telegram different, we don't promote these channels. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3464.3399999999997s)]
*  So everything that you have on Telegram is something that you have to deliberately search [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3466.9199999999996s)]
*  for and subscribe for. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3472.7799999999997s)]
*  So unlike some other apps that constantly recommend you content and content sources, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3474.86s)]
*  we don't do that. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3481.1s)]
*  You open Telegram, it's just an empty list of chats if you don't have any friend there [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3482.1s)]
*  and if you're not subscribed to any channel. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3487.8s)]
*  You have to deliberately find one. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3490.1400000000003s)]
*  So I think we're a completely neutral platform. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3492.54s)]
*  We allow everybody to express their voice within the rules of the common sense. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3495.5s)]
*  And then everybody can decide which point of view makes more sense to them and see [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3504.3s)]
*  if, for example, the government is right or their position is right. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3513.1000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3517.9s)]
*  That's called freedom. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3518.9s)]
*  That's called freedom. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3519.9s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's something that surprisingly faces a lot of backlash. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3520.9s)]
*  May I ask you a question about encryption? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3527.98s)]
*  So the advances in computing power, well, they're calling it quantum computing, right? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3530.18s)]
*  So they're just so exponential that it's hard even to understand for the non-engineered [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3537.8199999999997s)]
*  brain like mine, but they're profound. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3542.54s)]
*  The speed at which processes are now occurring, does that eliminate, what is the technological [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3545.4199999999996s)]
*  state of play? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3551.18s)]
*  Does that eliminate encryption? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3552.18s)]
*  Encryption will have to change, correct? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3553.18s)]
*  The encryption has to change and there has been made progress in encryption, which is [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3556.38s)]
*  like quantum secure. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3563.86s)]
*  So it's a constant evolution. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3565.3s)]
*  So the tools to decrypt become stronger and then the tools to encrypt become stronger. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3569.5s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3576.34s)]
*  Are you confident that encryption, that secure encryption will still exist as a technological [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3577.34s)]
*  matter with the rise of the superfast quantum computing? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3584.38s)]
*  It's very hard to be confident in anything because first of all, we have to rely on the [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3590.34s)]
*  computing power of our devices to decrypt things. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3595.78s)]
*  Of course, there are very sophisticated algorithms in place that make it so that you don't have [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3599.7400000000002s)]
*  to have the same level of computing power on your device as in a data center. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3608.12s)]
*  You have to bring a data center with you. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3615.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3616.96s)]
*  So it's not exactly like that. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3617.96s)]
*  Build a nuclear power plant by a hundred acres. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3619.4s)]
*  You don't have to. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3622.2400000000002s)]
*  But it continues. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3623.88s)]
*  So particularly state actors have almost infinite computing power at their disposal and they [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3627.12s)]
*  have certain technologies at their disposal that they may not be telling everybody about. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3633.6s)]
*  They might not be telling people about it? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3639.6s)]
*  So it's very possible that what you're saying will become reality or is already reality. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3644.4s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3649.72s)]
*  So that kind of is one of the questions. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3652.48s)]
*  I know you're legally bound here in France, so you're under some kind of state control. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3654.6s)]
*  I know your life is complicated because I don't want to push you to say things or get [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3662.32s)]
*  you in trouble, but it does feel like a determined government can spy on anybody it wants to. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3665.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the way it feels to me. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3672.48s)]
*  Do you think that's true? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3673.48s)]
*  Well, I think the biggest risk for personal privacy is the ability of any state actor [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3674.48s)]
*  to penetrate the device of the person, the mobile device, for example, because there [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3682.84s)]
*  are so-called zero-day vulnerabilities on iOS or Android phones, for example, that [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3687.6s)]
*  the governments sometimes know about and the secret agencies know about and they can exploit [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3695.6s)]
*  them, but everybody else doesn't know and they can't defend themselves from them. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3700.44s)]
*  So if you became a target of a government, it's really likely that they would install [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3707.3199999999997s)]
*  this Trojan, so-called Trojan, called Pegasus on your device. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3715.3199999999997s)]
*  And I was one of those people eight years ago that had Pegasus installed on their phones, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3719.88s)]
*  according to the leaked reports. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3726.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes, I've been there. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3729.08s)]
*  Is there any way, and I think a lot of people are there without knowing it, and I know that. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3730.68s)]
*  Is there any way to know if your phone has been compromised, if what you're looking at [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3736.04s)]
*  and typing is being read by somebody else? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3743.88s)]
*  Is there any way to know for certain? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3745.6400000000003s)]
*  For certain, probably no, but there are ways to check that and see if known vulnerabilities [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3747.8s)]
*  have been exploited on your phone. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3757.6400000000003s)]
*  And I know there are some organizations that can help you with that. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3762.92s)]
*  Where's your phone? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3766.08s)]
*  You didn't leave it out? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3767.08s)]
*  I don't use a phone. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3768.32s)]
*  I haven't used a phone for a year almost. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3769.32s)]
*  Oh, France took it. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3773.96s)]
*  Oh, France took it, but even before it took it, I wasn't using my phone. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3775.44s)]
*  I didn't have a SIM card in the phone. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3779.88s)]
*  I just use it to test Telegram, the app, because we have constant product updates. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3781.7200000000003s)]
*  I have to test it at least twice a week, but I'm not a user of a phone. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3785.36s)]
*  So I just want to say again, you're an engineer too. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3791.48s)]
*  I mean, you're not like a marketing guy. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3793.32s)]
*  You're like a build the app guy. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3794.84s)]
*  So you understand the technology? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3797.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3798.5600000000004s)]
*  Because you built it? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3799.5600000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3800.5600000000004s)]
*  You have a highly informed perspective when you make technology choices. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3801.56s)]
*  Is that fair? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3805.88s)]
*  You could say so. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3806.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3807.88s)]
*  One of the most informed probably in the world, and you don't have a phone. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3808.88s)]
*  What is that? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3812.44s)]
*  Like why don't you have a phone? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3813.44s)]
*  Well, I don't use phone regularly, right? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3814.44s)]
*  I probably own a phone, but I don't use phone. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3815.96s)]
*  I don't carry a phone with me because I find it extremely distracting. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3818.7999999999997s)]
*  I find it also potentially harming my privacy. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3825.12s)]
*  And I also just I don't think it's a necessary device for me to have. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3832.96s)]
*  When I want to focus on something, I would rather use my laptop or my iPad and put together [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3838.92s)]
*  some notes or some interact with my team, right? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3845.98s)]
*  So I wouldn't want to just open my phone and disappear their consuming short form content. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3850.92s)]
*  And that's why I don't use a phone. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3859.16s)]
*  I'm trying to extract this from you for one simple reason, which is I think that when [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3861.36s)]
*  you come across someone who knows an immense amount about technology, really understands [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3867.08s)]
*  the technology, it's interesting to know his perspective on technology. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3870.96s)]
*  Like with everything you know, you don't use a phone. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3875.36s)]
*  I just think people can draw their own conclusions from that. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3878.52s)]
*  You saw Ross Albrecht. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3886.52s)]
*  Albrecht, God. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3888.52s)]
*  The guy who was pardoned, yes. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3889.52s)]
*  Yeah, Silk Road. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3892.52s)]
*  So he ran Silk Road and I'm hardly an expert on this. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3895.52s)]
*  I was very pleased when he got pardoned. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3898.32s)]
*  But it seemed like no one accused him of selling drugs, by the way. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3902.28s)]
*  You would never know that from the New York Times, but he was not dealing drugs on playgrounds [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3906.52s)]
*  or anything like that. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3910.52s)]
*  He had a site that made commerce possible outside the control of government and there [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3911.52s)]
*  apparently were bad people doing bad things on it. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3918.52s)]
*  Also, a lot of good people doing good things on it, but none of it was controlled by the [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3920.52s)]
*  government and he got life in prison for that. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3923.52s)]
*  That's my takeaway. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3925.52s)]
*  And so maybe there will all, my conclusion from this is as long as people like you create [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3927.52s)]
*  technology that makes it harder for government to control people, you will be a target of [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3935.52s)]
*  government action. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3940.52s)]
*  Do you think that's? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3941.52s)]
*  Well, first of all, I wouldn't necessarily compare Telegram with Silk Road. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3942.52s)]
*  And I'm not. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3949.52s)]
*  But the idea that they need to control everything that is happening online and if they can't, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3950.52s)]
*  they're going to punish you, that does seem like a real fact. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3960.52s)]
*  I think everybody's trying to reach their goals and be more efficient in what they do. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3964.52s)]
*  For example, you ask any minister of interior, any head of police, and they'll tell you, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3970.52s)]
*  oh, encryption is a big problem. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3977.52s)]
*  If it weren't for encryption, we would solve all crime. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3979.52s)]
*  They don't see it two steps or three steps ahead. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3983.52s)]
*  And it's not necessarily like some huge conspiracy where the evil governments want to take more [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3987.52s)]
*  and more control, although that may be the case. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3994.52s)]
*  I'm not knowledgeable on that subject. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3996.52s)]
*  It seems to me more like everybody's trying to solve the problems that they see using [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=3998.52s)]
*  the tools that they have at their disposal, even if it negatively impacts other areas [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4007.52s)]
*  of our lives. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4014.52s)]
*  You're a very generous man, I must say. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4016.52s)]
*  Last question, and thank you for doing this. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4019.52s)]
*  How long are you going to be in France? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4022.52s)]
*  And once you leave France, will you be coming back to France? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4024.52s)]
*  I don't know yet when these restrictions will be lifted. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4027.52s)]
*  I hope later this year I will be able to travel to my home country, which is Dubai, freely. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4032.52s)]
*  I will probably come back to France because it's a great place to spend time in. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4040.52s)]
*  Of course, I have spent a lot of time in France now, eight months. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4052.52s)]
*  Kind of a full immersion program. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4060.52s)]
*  How's your French? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4062.52s)]
*  It's actually good. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4064.52s)]
*  I was very good when I passed my French exam to receive the passport. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4065.52s)]
*  It got 97 points out of 100. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4069.52s)]
*  But I didn't practice my French much. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4072.52s)]
*  Most of my friends are Americans, but even here in Paris. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4075.52s)]
*  And my French friends speak perfect English, so I didn't get a chance to practice. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4080.52s)]
*  But now you've had that chance? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4086.52s)]
*  No, because they speak English with me. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4088.52s)]
*  It's changed. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4092.52s)]
*  Before, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, it was difficult not to speak French in France. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4093.52s)]
*  Now, for better or worse, you can get by using English. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4100.52s)]
*  I'm trying to use my French, but I don't sound as... [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4105.52s)]
*  I sound even less intelligent in French than in English, so people switch back to English with me. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4109.52s)]
*  But you don't anticipate having to stay for the next 20 years or anything here? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4116.52s)]
*  I would be very surprised if that happened because, you see, I'm traveling to Dubai. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4121.52s)]
*  I'm coming back. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4126.52s)]
*  It's obvious that I'm not somebody who would try to escape forever. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4127.52s)]
*  And this investigation has to be concluded in one way or the other. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4134.52s)]
*  Of course, then if it goes to trial, if that happens, it can take another several years. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4141.52s)]
*  But then again, it would be completely crazy, I would say, if I would have to move to France [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4147.52s)]
*  and live here permanently for the whole duration of this process. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4155.52s)]
*  I would say that most likely, I expect that I would be able to travel again later this year. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4160.52s)]
*  Well, certainly rooting for you. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4171.52s)]
*  Pavel, thank you very much. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4173.52s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4174.52s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4179.52s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4183.52s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4184.52s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4185.52s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, all the change taking place in our economy [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4187.52s)]
*  and our politics, with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4191.52s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information rather than more. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4195.52s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4200.52s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4202.52s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4203.52s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4204.52s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4206.52s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4207.52s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get information [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4208.52s)]
*  that is true, not intentionally deceptive. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4211.52s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4214.52s)]
*  Subscribe. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4218.52s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4219.52s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4223.52s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFQvOyTolg&t=4228.52s)]
