# This Is What They Don’t Want You to Know About the Climate Agenda
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw)
*  In the United States, we often refer to our main sources of energy as fossil fuels. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=0.0s)]
*  Oil, natural gas, coal, they're fossil fuels because they come from fossils. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=5.44s)]
*  Ancient organic material, forests, jungles, plankton, dinosaurs, held under the ground for millennia, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=11.76s)]
*  they transform into oil, gas, and coal. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=21.2s)]
*  Everybody thinks that's true. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=25.36s)]
*  On the other hand, there's evidence that maybe it's not the whole story. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=27.68s)]
*  If that's where fossil fuels come from, if that's how hydrocarbons are made, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=31.12s)]
*  then how come they're found so deep under the oceans and at the top of the earth? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=35.68s)]
*  How come one of Saturn's moons, according to scientists, has more oil and natural gas than Earth? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=40.88s)]
*  Were there dinosaurs and planktons and forests at one point on one of Saturn's moons? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=48.64s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=54.8s)]
*  So if all hydrocarbons aren't from fossils, where are they from? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=56.56s)]
*  And why isn't this commonly known? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=60.88s)]
*  And what are the implications of it? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=62.64s)]
*  And what does it tell us about our modern climate change policy? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=64.16s)]
*  These are not just esoteric questions, they're central questions, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  actually, as we chart the future of energy usage in the world. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=72.16s)]
*  Willy Soon has been thinking about this for a long time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  He's an astrophysicist, a geoscientist. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=79.2s)]
*  He spent 31 years at Harvard. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=81.36s)]
*  He recently left, and he joins us here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=84.16s)]
*  Dr. Soon, thank you so much. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=86.88s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=88.32s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=89.28s)]
*  It's a blessing to be able to come on your show. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=89.52s)]
*  Well, it's a blessing to have you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  And this is such an interesting question with so many implications. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=93.36s)]
*  And I want to spend most of our time talking about the implications. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=96.24s)]
*  But just to the strict question of where hydrocarbons come from, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=98.0s)]
*  it sounds like they're not necessarily all from ancient forests or plankton or dinosaurs, are they? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  Yes. The story can be a bit long, so give me a few minutes to explain. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=109.6s)]
*  You are certainly right. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=114.32s)]
*  But most important to clarify is that the information that is found on the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=115.6s)]
*  largest moon on Saturn, which is called Titan, is actually results from NASA, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=120.88s)]
*  European Space Agency, and then the Italian Space Agency, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  who built this spacecraft called Cassini and Huygen. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=131.12s)]
*  Actually, one of my thesis advisor committee is actually built the UV spectrometer. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  But the one that they used to discover this, basically the ocean liquid, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=140.24s)]
*  liquid form of methane, which is in ethane form, which is much more complicated hydrocarbon, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=145.12s)]
*  is whole ocean of it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=150.96s)]
*  Because Titan is in such a way that it's very cold, by the way. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=152.88s)]
*  So it's minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=157.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=160.8s)]
*  Hint, hint, hint. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=161.44s)]
*  Where's the global warming there, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=162.08s)]
*  If it's full of methane there, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=163.52s)]
*  That's another problem because it's far away from the sun. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=169.28s)]
*  And clearly that the question of abiogenic matter, which means no need of any biology, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=169.84s)]
*  is true because we know. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=176.56s)]
*  Actually, one experimental experiment was done in 2009. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=179.52s)]
*  It was done in Swedish Royal Academy, one of those group. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=183.44s)]
*  But it's done by one Russian leader. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=187.28s)]
*  He was able to show that if you squeeze methane, CH4 in chemical formula, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=189.52s)]
*  so 4 hydrogen, 1 carbon, squeeze them in a form that in which they simulate the condition [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=196.08s)]
*  of the earth mantle, which is 1800 miles deep, kind of below the surface, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  because the earth is deeper, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=208.8s)]
*  And it's within this 18, but basically the condition that is only about 40 to 150 miles in, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  that you actually can form complex hydrocarbon. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  You got benzene, you got ethane, you got all these other stuff forming. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  So that proved beyond doubt that you have such a way to make this, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=223.44s)]
*  plus that Titan proved beyond doubt. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  You actually see methane also in all the atmosphere of Jupiter. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=228.24s)]
*  You even find benzene in the rocks of Mars. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=232.88s)]
*  And then for me, astrophysicist, I can tell you even more. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=237.04s)]
*  You find this complex hydrocarbon called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=240.24s)]
*  It's another one of those complex hydrocarbon. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=245.52s)]
*  Then actually you found it in interstellar space, which is space within stars, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=248.24s)]
*  intergalactic space. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=252.8s)]
*  These are everywhere because temperature there are cold [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=254.8s)]
*  and probably the right pressure condition, all this complex hydrocarbon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=258.08s)]
*  Well, it's kind of incredible because all of us, including myself until very recently, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=262.32s)]
*  assumed that all of our main energy sources are these so-called fossil fuels. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=267.68s)]
*  And of course, their existence is going to be limited by the amount of fossils, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=272.88s)]
*  by the amount of decaying organic material. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=278.32s)]
*  Not so. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=280.88s)]
*  So if that's not so, then we need to rethink a lot of things. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=282.24s)]
*  A lot. I think this one fit into a paradigm, a famous economist that I like very much. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=285.2s)]
*  His name is Simon. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you know about this guy named Simon? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  Julian Simon. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=295.76s)]
*  Julian Simon, yeah, the key guy, you see of Illinois and then Maryland. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=296.48s)]
*  He was the guy who said that the ultimate resource of humanity or Earth is actually not [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=300.56s)]
*  all this material thing like uranium gold. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=307.12s)]
*  Because uranium, there are far more uranium in the oceans than on the land. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=309.6s)]
*  You have 4.5 billion tons of uranium in the ocean. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=314.56s)]
*  You have only 17 million tons of gold, copper. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=319.12s)]
*  What do you want on the ocean? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  It's all there except they're in very dilute form, clearly. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  So the ultimate resource actually is not that, it's the human mind. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=329.04s)]
*  It's the innovation part of it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=333.04s)]
*  I think I like that principle a lot. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=335.04s)]
*  It fits very well in terms of saying that it's all matter of cost, even oil. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=336.88s)]
*  I don't know if any of you know, the audience know that 50 to 60% of the oil that you already [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=342.32s)]
*  drilled, the drill hole, you can only pull out 40 to 50% of it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=350.56s)]
*  60% of that remains in it simply because there's not enough pressure to get it out. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=355.76s)]
*  This is why the idea of abiogenic oil is interesting. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=360.64s)]
*  It's true, clearly true. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=364.48s)]
*  It's all matter of cost, really. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=365.84s)]
*  Because this thing has to form way inside the earth, the mantle, which is 50 to 100 miles. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=367.84s)]
*  Human, how deep have we ever drilled? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=375.2s)]
*  Only the skin, which is only five miles maximum, five to six miles basically. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=377.84s)]
*  At most, we can drill. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=383.28s)]
*  And then all this stuff has to permeate into the reservoir. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  I got this information from the top. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=387.44s)]
*  People that physically have to look for oil every day. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  One of my friends, Joseph Lime Cooler from Beacon Energy, Offshore Energy, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=393.2s)]
*  those are the guys who work day in and day out to bring us the energy actually, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=397.44s)]
*  the oil that we need. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=401.28s)]
*  So why don't most people know this? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=402.32s)]
*  Why do most people think that the gasoline in their car was by definition- [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=405.68s)]
*  It has to be limited, yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=410.4s)]
*  Yeah, that there's just a tiny amount and it's going away. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=412.32s)]
*  We'll never find more. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=416.56s)]
*  The world is full of untruth and half-truths. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=417.44s)]
*  That's the whole problem. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=419.76s)]
*  That's why for so long, even the idea that we are not limited and bounded by availability of, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=420.88s)]
*  let's say, gasoline, petroleum or coal. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=427.12s)]
*  Coal now, they won't allow us to use. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=430.08s)]
*  As you know, in a court meeting in Dubai that just ended a day ago, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=432.08s)]
*  they just physically declared themselves that we should stop using fossil fuel. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=436.16s)]
*  Basically, petroleum, natural gas, and even coal. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=440.48s)]
*  These people are insane now, really insane. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=444.56s)]
*  I think they're going to harm more people with their own delusion. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  Plus, they always remember these are people who actually don't represent the majority. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=450.0s)]
*  Since when had this put up to work? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=454.64s)]
*  It's always about this minority, the tyranny of the few, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=456.48s)]
*  always robbing the whole census, the good census of the good people. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=460.0s)]
*  This is part of the reason why as a scientist, I also speak out. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=463.84s)]
*  Feel, I mean, not afraid of anything except for just telling the truth. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=467.44s)]
*  And I'm glad to have this opportunity to say such thing in your show. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=470.8s)]
*  So, I mean, if we haven't been told the truth about where [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=474.72s)]
*  hydrocarbons come from, and we haven't, I mean, I've never met a single person in my life [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=481.12s)]
*  who said, wait a second, they're not all fossil fuels. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=485.92s)]
*  Then we keep hearing there's a scientific consensus on climate change. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  Every scientist believes the same thing about it, believes Al Gore and John Kerry. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=493.12s)]
*  Maybe that's not true either. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, then I can tell you, please. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for asking that question, Tucker. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=501.76000000000005s)]
*  I've been working on this subject of CO2 causing climate change or what other factors [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=504.08s)]
*  we can ask that cause climate to change for close to as long as since my postdoctoral year, 1991. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=509.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=516.0s)]
*  So it's about 31 years, 32 years. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=516.16s)]
*  And on this question, I think we have a very definitive answer. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=519.28s)]
*  What we know now is CO2 ain't going to cost nothing. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=522.96s)]
*  It's not going to change much of the climatic system, which means [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=527.68s)]
*  it won't change the speed of the hurricane. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=531.28s)]
*  It won't change how fast or how frequent tornado form. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=533.28s)]
*  It won't even actually make any difference to the polar bear population. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=536.64s)]
*  It's all conservation issue, right, on polar bear. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=541.28s)]
*  It won't even cause how much fish you don't catch or catch, you know? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=543.92s)]
*  It won't even cause what they call ocean acidification. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=546.72s)]
*  It won't even cause this problem that they claim. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=549.36s)]
*  It's all artificial. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  Everything they do is all dream from their model and the tyranny of the field again. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=552.88s)]
*  That those few people just dream up this scary story that is just ain't true. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=557.92s)]
*  And then when you come down to the most responsible group for this kind of bad stuff, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=563.28s)]
*  I was reminded by my colleague, Dr. Ronan Connolly and Michael Connolly, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=568.72s)]
*  my two co-workers with me on my group, is to say that since, you know, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  since I work so carefully and I have about more than a hundred scientists [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  last three years alone working with me, so I don't speak on behalf of them. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=581.28s)]
*  I speak on behalf of myself. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  My view is that the UNIPCC, United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=586.88s)]
*  is one of the primary problems, which means they have been misleading people. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=592.64s)]
*  They've been using authority of science, which is not true. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=597.28s)]
*  It's all governmental hackers, basically. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=601.04s)]
*  People like John Kerry, who I guess can barely take a proper physics class [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=604.56s)]
*  who keep claiming that greenhouse effect is so simple. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=609.68s)]
*  And then he refused to explain how does it work. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=613.6s)]
*  I mean, he did all of that that is very terrible. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=617.2s)]
*  That really embarrassing to America. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=620.16s)]
*  He did that in Bali and Indonesia several years back. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=622.4s)]
*  That is just so embarrassing. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=625.28s)]
*  Do you think he can explain how it works? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=628.8s)]
*  Even Al Gore, who claimed to be know something about science. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=630.64s)]
*  I challenged Al Gore. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=634.56s)]
*  I did some of that to him in his face, actually. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=636.16s)]
*  I have, I was lucky enough to be in one of those Wall Street Journal Eco Conference. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=639.6s)]
*  And I was giving, you know, setting up with all the UC Santa Barbara student. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=644.9599999999999s)]
*  Please make sure when the question come out, give me the mic. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=649.1999999999999s)]
*  I was making friends with them the night before. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=652.0s)]
*  I explained now my details of my work. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=654.48s)]
*  So I got the mic and asked question about Al Gore. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=656.88s)]
*  Because one of the primary sad thing that they refused to recognize, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=661.12s)]
*  that I know you know that in even great school sciences, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=664.96s)]
*  CO2 is a gas of life. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=669.2s)]
*  When you have more CO2, the plant kingdom, the whole ecology, even the oceans, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=672.08s)]
*  gonna have more basically ability, more fishes, more everything. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=678.24s)]
*  More life. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=682.72s)]
*  More life, essentially. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=683.36s)]
*  That's why it's called gas of life. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=684.88s)]
*  And these people want to demonize it as some gas that can cause global warming, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=686.48s)]
*  can cause hurricane to run faster or weaker. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=690.4s)]
*  I don't know what they want. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=692.48s)]
*  To have more rain, more droughts and all these other nonsense that they claim. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=693.84s)]
*  All of that, it just ain't so. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=697.52s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=699.84s)]
*  By the way, this is how serious I am. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  I check everything they say. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=703.36s)]
*  I check. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  As a scientist, you cannot just dismiss them. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=706.0s)]
*  You cannot laugh at them. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=708.8s)]
*  You cannot, you know, try them. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  You cannot just make joke of them. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=711.36s)]
*  You check everything. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=713.04s)]
*  So as a very serious scientist, and I published scientific paper refuting all of this argument. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=714.0799999999999s)]
*  Scientific paper maybe mean nothing to the average people, but it's really important. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=720.0s)]
*  It's like a document that you have the document. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=724.16s)]
*  And then put out the proper scientific arguments about what is right, what is wrong. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=727.12s)]
*  So that's what we have been doing at my particular center called series-science.com. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=731.36s)]
*  So anybody who wants more information about this, please go to the website, right? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=736.8s)]
*  And study what we do there because we are the one that is truly independent from any funding agency, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=740.88s)]
*  any money that you could possibly give me. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=746.8s)]
*  Like Bill Gates, please don't give me money. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=749.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  And Al Gore, please don't give me money. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=751.76s)]
*  Don't give me any money if you tell me what to do. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=753.92s)]
*  You know, even some of your money, I might not want it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=756.24s)]
*  But the point is that I want to be independent, just like you. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=758.72s)]
*  In the media, I want to be fearless. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  I just set my own agenda. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=763.52s)]
*  You don't tell me what to research either. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=764.96s)]
*  I research what I want to research. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  So we've been researching on many, many topics. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=768.48s)]
*  So on the climate change issue, I'm fully convinced. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=770.96s)]
*  After all these years, even though we may not know exactly what is causing climate change, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=774.4s)]
*  we suspect it's the sun. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of evidence to show that it's probably the sun. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=781.6s)]
*  Very high percentage, you know, like I would say 90% were sure. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=784.96s)]
*  But not 100%. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=788.72s)]
*  But we know carbon dioxide is not the gas. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=790.48s)]
*  It's not what you call your thermometer in your room. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=794.64s)]
*  Can adjust up and down that you can set the temperature to be whatever level you want it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=797.44s)]
*  First of all, they can never tell us what temperature do they want it at. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=802.72s)]
*  What is the temperature you want to set the global temperature? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=807.2s)]
*  Al Gore has not been able to answer that. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=810.48s)]
*  John Kerry has not been able to answer that. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=812.4s)]
*  Because we know the temperature from the coldest in Siberia. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  To the desert in Sahara. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=818.64s)]
*  I mean, these are huge, at least 100 degree or more kind of differences. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=821.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=825.92s)]
*  I mean, who are you to tell me which temperature is the correct temperature? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=826.64s)]
*  Where you guys are talking like that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=830.72s)]
*  They are talking as if they are pseudo-god, they are god themselves. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, these people are so ambitious that in some sense, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  I think we have to keep their ambition down a little bit. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=838.4s)]
*  I mean, these people are not contented, just like what you put out there. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=841.12s)]
*  You cannot be ambitious when you're contented. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=844.8s)]
*  But these people are so out of their mind in some sense, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=846.48s)]
*  that I think is misleading. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=849.28s)]
*  And somebody had to speak out against them. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=850.96s)]
*  I think you are one of those who consistently point out their hypocrisy. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=853.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=856.72s)]
*  And I really find that the whole problem of this global warming is a complete nothing. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=857.36s)]
*  Which means we should do nothing about it. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=862.64s)]
*  Just go on and live life and adapt to it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=864.5600000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=867.12s)]
*  So what I, here's, of course I agree completely, but here's what I don't understand. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=867.44s)]
*  Global temperatures have dramatically fluctuated within the period that humans left records. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=873.2s)]
*  I mean, not that long ago. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=880.96s)]
*  I mean, there are cities underwater because sea levels have risen within recorded history. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=882.08s)]
*  The signs of the glaciers are all around us. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=888.32s)]
*  So that was all before the internal combustion engine. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=891.44s)]
*  How do they explain that? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=895.0400000000001s)]
*  This is the problem. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=896.48s)]
*  They admitted, a lot of them admitted. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  They willingly admitted. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=900.32s)]
*  You can't deny it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=902.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we had glaciers and then they melted because of global warming. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=903.52s)]
*  They are forced to confess. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=905.52s)]
*  I mean, these are the confession time. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=906.96s)]
*  It's the sun, actually, that does a lot of this. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=909.12s)]
*  The glacier, like there's a period called Little Ice Age. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=911.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=914.4s)]
*  From about 1300 to 1900, very cold. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=914.8000000000001s)]
*  And then there's a middable warm period from 880 to about 1200. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, it was warm. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you can grow wine in England, right? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=923.84s)]
*  And now you cannot grow wine, right? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=926.72s)]
*  Things like that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=928.72s)]
*  I mean, Greenland was green. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=929.36s)]
*  Back then. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=931.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=931.92s)]
*  Now it's full of glaciers. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=932.16s)]
*  Ice is coming in. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=933.92s)]
*  So what are you talking about exactly? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=935.04s)]
*  And it was the sun, actually. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  The sun fit quite well. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=938.24s)]
*  As far as we know, in terms of deduct, deducing the information of how does the sun, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=940.0s)]
*  how bright was it, how dim was it. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=945.28s)]
*  Basically, just like that. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=947.92s)]
*  Just the amount of light coming out from the sun. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=948.88s)]
*  Very tiny percentage, by the way. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=951.28s)]
*  Very small. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=952.88s)]
*  It's on the order of less than a percent, but it's more than enough because [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  there's another effect that is very, very important. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  It's basically because the sun, the earth is forced to go around the sun. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=960.88s)]
*  And then the orbit changed ever so slightly because of perturbation from all the other planets. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=964.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=969.6s)]
*  You know, Jupiter, Saturn, and even Venus and Mars. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=969.92s)]
*  They're actually controlling what we do. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=972.8s)]
*  And the moon, of course, is very important. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=974.88s)]
*  But that other factor, the orbits, plus the changes of the sun by itself, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=976.88s)]
*  between how bright, how dim it is. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=981.84s)]
*  These two factors can explain just about everything that we know. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=984.88s)]
*  All the data that I have, actually. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=989.6s)]
*  So I've been studying. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=992.0s)]
*  This is why I was so fascinated in studying this issue. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=992.8s)]
*  I spent my whole life, actually, studying this. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=996.0s)]
*  Nothing but doing just this. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=998.8s)]
*  And the more I understand, the more I think that, wow, it's just a gap to be filled in. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1000.56s)]
*  We have too much information that... [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1004.64s)]
*  And then these people come along, say that CO2 is causing everything. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1006.48s)]
*  I check. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1010.08s)]
*  I check. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1011.04s)]
*  Oh, maybe they're right. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1011.52s)]
*  I check. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1012.4s)]
*  As a scientist, I have to check them. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1012.96s)]
*  But then it's not even close. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1014.88s)]
*  I mean, these people are talking about things that is... [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1017.04s)]
*  There's a famous phrase by a very famous Wisconsin meteorologist. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1020.72s)]
*  His name is Professor Reed Bryson. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  He's one of the fathers of climatology, really. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1026.4s)]
*  He just say that you go out and then you could might as well, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1028.96s)]
*  if you think CO2 is so, you might as well spit into the air and see what happened to the airflow. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1031.92s)]
*  He was just basically saying that CO2 is nothing. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1036.48s)]
*  Cannot cause the climate to change or anything. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1039.6s)]
*  It doesn't change anything, actually. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1042.8s)]
*  It's the sun. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1044.24s)]
*  Why you think the most important things that you should talk about, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1045.44s)]
*  they never talk about that. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1048.48s)]
*  They always want to average the data. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1049.8400000000001s)]
*  The most important thing they should talk about, you know what? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1052.0800000000002s)]
*  It's the season. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1054.24s)]
*  Every... [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1055.2800000000002s)]
*  No two winter are the same. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1056.0800000000002s)]
*  No two summers are the same. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1057.2s)]
*  And they never explain that. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1058.88s)]
*  It's actually the orbits with the sun changing it ever so slightly. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1060.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm not talking. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1064.16s)]
*  I have published papers, papers and papers and papers like that, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1065.3600000000001s)]
*  on all this to show and document why and how. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1068.48s)]
*  That's what the fun part of doing science is not only... [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  Chatting, hand waving like crazy. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1074.48s)]
*  You have to be. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1076.8000000000002s)]
*  Even though I may look like one now, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1077.76s)]
*  but I'm always very calm when you write down, you know, like my... [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1079.2s)]
*  Every time I have to write a paper, I always tell my wife, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1082.3200000000002s)]
*  please don't disturb me for a few days. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1084.48s)]
*  I'll be back. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1086.5600000000002s)]
*  Things like that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1088.24s)]
*  Of course, working at home, but I'll be back. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1088.8000000000002s)]
*  Is there any way to predict what climate change will be based on... [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1092.3200000000002s)]
*  Actually, you can because of the orbit. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1096.4s)]
*  The only thing we don't know is how to predict the sun changes by itself [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1098.72s)]
*  because the magnetism, you know, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1101.68s)]
*  just the magnetic field on the sun is too complicated. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1103.28s)]
*  The sun is the magnetized ball, right? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1106.24s)]
*  It's a gas, hot gas. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1108.0800000000002s)]
*  It's about, you know, the magnetic field is so strong, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1109.76s)]
*  it's 10,000 times stronger than the earth. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1112.24s)]
*  The earth is also a magnet, a bar magnet, basically. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1114.0800000000002s)]
*  It's one Gauss, we have 10,000 Gauss at least on the sun. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1116.5600000000002s)]
*  So it's a very different property. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1119.8400000000001s)]
*  And it works very differently because it heated by basically [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1121.68s)]
*  a thermonuclear reaction inside the sun. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1125.28s)]
*  So it created all kinds of hot gas behavior that's very difficult to [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1127.92s)]
*  try to master or even to model using mathematical equation. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1133.2s)]
*  Actually, it's much easier to study the earth than to do the sun. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1137.04s)]
*  So that's part of the problem in scientific tasks, the physics tasks. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1140.0800000000002s)]
*  They're very difficult. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1143.92s)]
*  But then we learn a lot. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1144.88s)]
*  We learn a lot through just watching the sun. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1146.0s)]
*  I mean Galileo Galilei, right? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1149.44s)]
*  He pointed his telescope. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1152.0s)]
*  He was smart enough. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1154.0800000000002s)]
*  First, he pointed the Jupiter, the moon, right? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1154.88s)]
*  Jupiter, then he saw the moon, right? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1156.96s)]
*  He saw four moons around it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1158.96s)]
*  And then he's smart that he go the next day to watch it again. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1160.64s)]
*  He watched and then he say started to move. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1164.24s)]
*  Well, it's a famous story of Galileo Galilei will talk about it someday. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1166.08s)]
*  When he wrote that down, initially it was in Italian. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1169.76s)]
*  When he realized he discovered something so unique, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1173.04s)]
*  he changed the language to Latin the next day. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1176.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I got it, man. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1178.56s)]
*  The good one. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1179.92s)]
*  It's not writing in Latin, precise language, okay? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1181.1200000000001s)]
*  But anyway, for the sun, it's really so complicated that actually I've been studying this actually [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1183.52s)]
*  as long as you know me. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1189.6s)]
*  I mean, I studied this for so long. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1190.8799999999999s)]
*  We know a lot. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1193.04s)]
*  I even wrote a popular book actually to try to explain [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1193.92s)]
*  why that during a period of the sunspot, so Galileo Galilei start in 1609, 1610 or so. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1196.8799999999999s)]
*  So we have about now 413 years of data. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1203.04s)]
*  But there's a period that deep inside the Little Ice Age, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1207.44s)]
*  1645 to 1715 is called the Mondo minimum. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1211.6799999999998s)]
*  Because during that period, the sunspot almost all disappear, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1216.48s)]
*  especially in the Northern Hemisphere. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1221.76s)]
*  It disappeared completely. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  Nobody know why. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1224.9599999999998s)]
*  And that's why the French astronomer, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1226.6399999999999s)]
*  famous people like Cassini, the one that the Cassini spacecraft, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1230.0s)]
*  he was observing at that time. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1233.28s)]
*  He said, man, this Galileo guy must be either drinking too much or lying or things like that. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1235.12s)]
*  He said there's a lot of sunspots, but we observe at this time, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1240.4s)]
*  we didn't see nothing. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1243.52s)]
*  What's wrong? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1244.64s)]
*  But it is an actual phenomenon. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1245.8400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1248.0800000000002s)]
*  My friend, my good friend, which is the number one world sunspot historian, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1248.4s)]
*  he just wrote email to me, Douglas Hoy. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1252.0s)]
*  He actually was the master of this collecting all the sunspot data, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1254.3200000000002s)]
*  going back to all the major libraries, you know, from Galileo first point, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1258.0s)]
*  all the way to present point. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1261.76s)]
*  Basically found that this phenomenon is true because during that period, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1263.6000000000001s)]
*  the sunspot was not there, not because nobody was watching. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1266.88s)]
*  There was at least observed 80% of the time during the 70 years. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1269.84s)]
*  You see, it's so unique that period. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1274.1599999999999s)]
*  But now we're beginning to try to learn what happened there. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1276.08s)]
*  So during that period, we really think that the sun was so much dimmer, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1278.3999999999999s)]
*  was substantially dimmer. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1283.1999999999998s)]
*  This is why you have this little Ice Age phenomenon. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1284.56s)]
*  All the Thames River were froze. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1287.52s)]
*  You know, we have the Thames River in England, well known, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1289.84s)]
*  and then all the ice skating thing, you know, in Holland, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1293.1999999999998s)]
*  all the different culture. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1295.84s)]
*  And then these are all real actual phenomenon. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1297.84s)]
*  And then this day, they're trying to say that maybe little Ice Age [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1300.48s)]
*  is not little Ice Age. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1303.92s)]
*  They even try to change that in scientific field, actually. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  So this was very, very puzzling for me. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1307.84s)]
*  Why would they try and change that? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1310.4s)]
*  Oh, I don't know, because they want to say the CO2 is controlling everything. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1312.08s)]
*  They kind of want to have CO2 as the prime driver of everything. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1315.92s)]
*  This is part of the problem that I find. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1319.12s)]
*  Well, that's not science. That's lying. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1321.36s)]
*  Ah, it's bad. It's bad in science. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1323.2s)]
*  This is why in science now, I'd rather say this thing outright. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1325.28s)]
*  I'd rather have question that cannot be answered than answer that cannot be questioned. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1329.68s)]
*  Because these people are just offering you the answer [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1334.24s)]
*  and then you should just shut up like you say. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1336.96s)]
*  Don't ask any question. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1339.04s)]
*  Don't criticize. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1340.48s)]
*  Don't even bother to think. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1341.36s)]
*  Just accept what we say. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1343.12s)]
*  I mean, you may have known that actually, if you want to get there, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1344.8799999999999s)]
*  I can talk about this because this is rather famous [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1348.3999999999999s)]
*  because the other person is still around. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1350.3999999999999s)]
*  He's the one who's shouting up and down these last two days [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1352.48s)]
*  to say that, oh, we must stop fossil fuel. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1355.76s)]
*  GOP is so evil. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1357.84s)]
*  We must stop all of them because we are the... [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1359.2s)]
*  GOP are the evil political bodies in America [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  that causes all this fossil fuel to be... [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1364.96s)]
*  We are using fossil fuel and all that. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1367.04s)]
*  His name is Professor Michael Man. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1368.72s)]
*  He's at University of Pennsylvania. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1370.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1372.08s)]
*  He created a paper. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1372.4s)]
*  We call it a hockey shtick. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1373.84s)]
*  Yes, a shtick paper. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1375.36s)]
*  A hockey shtick. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1376.48s)]
*  He basically say that the temperature history... [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1377.36s)]
*  First of all, the true temperature history looked like this. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1379.92s)]
*  It was very warm from 800 A.D. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1382.8000000000002s)]
*  Let's say warm, warm, and then it cools down. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1385.76s)]
*  About 1300 started to go down, cool. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1387.52s)]
*  And then since about 1900 century, it started to warm back up. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1390.24s)]
*  Way, way before CO2 is important. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1394.96s)]
*  That's another puzzle that they never want to explain. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1397.3600000000001s)]
*  It looked like this. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1399.44s)]
*  That's the real story. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1400.4s)]
*  Michael Man came along, said that, well, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1401.92s)]
*  he used mathematical algorithm. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1404.88s)]
*  You can use fancy words, but believe me, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1408.64s)]
*  it's just mathematical algorithm. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1410.8s)]
*  That he produced a stick for 800 A.D. to about 1900 A.D. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1413.04s)]
*  It's all flat because it changed. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1418.32s)]
*  It changed very tiny amount. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1419.68s)]
*  So small that actually it doesn't mean anything. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1421.2s)]
*  0.1 or 0.2 degree Celsius. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1423.6s)]
*  So small. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1425.44s)]
*  It doesn't mean... [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1426.4s)]
*  The one that I talk about, the change is one degree at least. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1427.36s)]
*  You know, five, six times bigger than what he say. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1429.76s)]
*  And then he just say it is like this. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1432.96s)]
*  And then it warm up because of the blade, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1434.56s)]
*  which is the warming because of rising carbon dioxide. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1437.2s)]
*  But he forgot to explain to you. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1439.92s)]
*  This warming of the temperature started way before [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1441.44s)]
*  even the human part of the atmospheric carbon dioxide [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1445.76s)]
*  could be anything meaningful. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1448.72s)]
*  This is part of the problem. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1450.4s)]
*  It's all been crazy from day one. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1451.52s)]
*  When this thing was published in 1999, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1454.16s)]
*  I was the first few guy who raised a hand [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1457.1200000000001s)]
*  at the back of the class and say, excuse me, Professor Man. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1459.8400000000001s)]
*  He used to be my friend, by the way. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1462.4s)]
*  Now he will never answer me. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1463.76s)]
*  He used to exchange email with me because, you know, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1465.44s)]
*  we more or less share the same passion, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1467.92s)]
*  want to understand things. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1469.52s)]
*  Now he just say that his story is the only one that is correct. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1470.8s)]
*  But it's not bad out by any data that we know. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1474.64s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1477.3600000000001s)]
*  It's all mathematical products. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1478.48s)]
*  This is how scary the whole world can be. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1480.24s)]
*  And United Nation, the IPCC group that I mentioned, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1482.72s)]
*  promoted his work, turning it into a major hero [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1486.56s)]
*  because he has solved one of this old puzzle problem [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1490.64s)]
*  that climatologists over millennia [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1493.84s)]
*  has been trying to solve since the day of the Greeks [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1496.4s)]
*  to try to understand how climate change. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1499.12s)]
*  And this guy come along, say that it look like this, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1501.28s)]
*  only CO2 does it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1503.36s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1505.2s)]
*  So, I mean, it just ain't so... [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1507.44s)]
*  Some of this is very complex, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1511.04s)]
*  but in the way you're describing it, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1512.64s)]
*  if he's saying the warming period began [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1514.16s)]
*  before there was a meaningful addition of CO2 [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1516.64s)]
*  into the atmosphere caused by humans, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1519.52s)]
*  even I can understand that. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1521.6s)]
*  Yes, that's the truth. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1522.88s)]
*  So I would assume that lots of scientists [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1524.4s)]
*  who do this for a living might be asking the same question. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1526.88s)]
*  Why don't they speak up? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1529.3600000000001s)]
*  This is the problem. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1531.1200000000001s)]
*  The whole problem in science these days [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1532.64s)]
*  is related to funding, how science is funded. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1535.68s)]
*  That natural, that philosophy, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1538.24s)]
*  I wish to not get too much into it. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1540.3200000000002s)]
*  This is part of the reason why [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1541.92s)]
*  I want to be totally independent. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1543.2800000000002s)]
*  I get out of this whole system, right? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  But it's how science is about funding. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1547.8400000000001s)]
*  Even if you don't get money directly, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1550.48s)]
*  it will influence the graduate students [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1552.56s)]
*  and on and on and so forth, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1554.64s)]
*  all these other related effects. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1556.0s)]
*  And many people are afraid to speak up. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1559.6s)]
*  But I tell you, if you really put all the scientists [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1561.84s)]
*  to an honest kind of polling, if you're science, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1564.32s)]
*  but science is not about polling too. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1566.64s)]
*  All it takes is one to be correct. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1568.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1570.96s)]
*  That's the problem, right? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1571.3600000000001s)]
*  Einstein used to, when he formulated [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1572.4s)]
*  the famous general relativity or special relativity, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1574.08s)]
*  that actually, that was criticized, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1576.88s)]
*  that basically talk about speed or light is constant. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1578.72s)]
*  So time and space are relative. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1581.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1583.6799999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1584.1599999999999s)]
*  Time can be dilated. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1584.56s)]
*  Space is also slightly different [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1585.9199999999998s)]
*  because the speed of light is constant. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1587.76s)]
*  Special relativity is based on that concept. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1589.6s)]
*  Then 100 of these Berlin academicians [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1591.84s)]
*  tried to wrote a pamphlet, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1595.1999999999998s)]
*  say that Einstein is wrong, but never offer why. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1596.56s)]
*  What is the details that is wrong? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1599.6799999999998s)]
*  And then Einstein indeed answered like this. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1601.9199999999998s)]
*  Why would you need 100? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1604.9599999999998s)]
*  If I were to be wrong, one would suffice. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1607.52s)]
*  I mean, that's the theme of the science. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1610.56s)]
*  Science is so bad because it's so totally upside down, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1612.96s)]
*  inside out, COVID is another case. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1617.3600000000001s)]
*  So let's stick to climate stuff. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1619.92s)]
*  People are afraid to speak up. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1621.84s)]
*  I don't know why, actually. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1623.2s)]
*  I was young. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1624.4s)]
*  I had to worry about my three kids, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1625.44s)]
*  where they eat and all that stuff. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1627.2s)]
*  Buffet all the time, just kidding. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1628.8s)]
*  The greatest American invention. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1631.2s)]
*  This is truly entrepreneur, by the way. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1634.08s)]
*  Anyway, we have enough food. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1636.4s)]
*  No problem. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1638.4s)]
*  That's why food, I don't think, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1639.2s)]
*  is also a problem in this world. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1640.24s)]
*  Even material resources, right? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1642.0s)]
*  All you think is have to think like Julian Simon type. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1643.68s)]
*  You know, we can generate everything. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1646.32s)]
*  The only problem we left is lack of imagination, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1648.24s)]
*  narrow mindedness, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1651.3600000000001s)]
*  and all this anti-America sentiment, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1652.72s)]
*  put it this way. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1654.8s)]
*  America is among the best hope for humanity, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1655.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, to put forward. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1658.0s)]
*  We have the foundation document, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1658.88s)]
*  the constitution, for God's sake. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1660.72s)]
*  That is the most beautiful thing [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1662.8s)]
*  that we could ever imagine. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1664.24s)]
*  And why don't we use it properly, right? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1665.92s)]
*  People are just trashing on it every day, right? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1668.32s)]
*  Anyway, I digress. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1670.8799999999999s)]
*  Anyway, so yes, I think science is a problem now [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1674.24s)]
*  because of funding structure. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1677.9199999999998s)]
*  People won't speak up. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1679.04s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1680.0s)]
*  I think it's natural for people to be afraid, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1681.2s)]
*  but you can also be afraid for so long. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1683.76s)]
*  For me, I was frustrated because I was not afraid [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1685.52s)]
*  ever since I was in science, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1688.08s)]
*  because I'm in science because I love science. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1689.52s)]
*  This is why, from my own perspective, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1691.6s)]
*  I'm just very sad to see that science [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1694.3999999999999s)]
*  is being trampled by all these other non-science forces. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1696.24s)]
*  You know, that's why when I look at COVID also, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1699.68s)]
*  I cannot stand by and say nothing. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1701.92s)]
*  On COVID-19, there's so many things wrong with it. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1703.8400000000001s)]
*  That's why I want to pre-advertise. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1706.48s)]
*  With my group, series.science.com, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1708.4s)]
*  we work with a bunch of people. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1710.4s)]
*  One of the good guests for you, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1711.68s)]
*  potentially, will be Professor Harvey Rich. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  He said he'd been interviewed by you twice. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1715.1200000000001s)]
*  Even guys like Bob Malone, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1717.2s)]
*  we work together to produce a paper. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1718.3200000000002s)]
*  So when the paper comes out, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1720.16s)]
*  hopefully we can have them on your show [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1721.28s)]
*  so they can tell more stories. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1723.28s)]
*  We want to provide the medical community, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1725.28s)]
*  or even the world, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1728.24s)]
*  to document this episode of Dark Ages in medical sciences. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1729.44s)]
*  Something went terribly wrong. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1732.96s)]
*  The mask never really worked. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1734.56s)]
*  The vaccine never really worked. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1736.16s)]
*  All of this doesn't work. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1737.92s)]
*  The lockdown doesn't work. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1739.28s)]
*  And what are we doing this? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1740.96s)]
*  Now they're trying to scare with another new scare. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1742.48s)]
*  All over the world now. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1744.72s)]
*  Newspaper. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1746.16s)]
*  This morning, I just got one newspaper from my sister [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1746.72s)]
*  who has to start, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1749.76s)]
*  oh, they start masking up in Malaysia now. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1750.96s)]
*  Because cases start to increase. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1753.12s)]
*  The usual story. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1755.76s)]
*  I laugh in a serious way because [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1756.8799999999999s)]
*  I see this is another one of those attempts again [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1759.28s)]
*  to try to scare people. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1761.9199999999998s)]
*  So I did digress now. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1763.36s)]
*  Science is just so complicated now that [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1764.9599999999998s)]
*  every aspect of the science that I look at [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1767.12s)]
*  I've become very unhappy. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1769.04s)]
*  Science is no longer able to do where science leads. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1770.9599999999998s)]
*  This is the theme of my series, science.com. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1774.08s)]
*  With few only colleagues. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1777.12s)]
*  I don't have enough funding. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1778.8799999999999s)]
*  I just hope to get as many donations, by the way. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1780.0s)]
*  Donate but don't tell us anything. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1782.32s)]
*  Do anything. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1783.76s)]
*  Trust us because we are decent scientists. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1784.8s)]
*  You can look at our publication record [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1787.36s)]
*  that we are able to produce the most interesting and pure work. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1789.6799999999998s)]
*  Like IPCC. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1793.28s)]
*  They have to reply to us. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1794.56s)]
*  Two years ago, we published a very important paper. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1796.32s)]
*  One of my journalist friend, a colleague wrote a paper. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1798.96s)]
*  Newspaper article. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1802.96s)]
*  And then he go and ask IPCC, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1804.48s)]
*  why are you guys not signing this paper? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1806.08s)]
*  They use the excuse to say that, oh, these people published late. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1807.84s)]
*  We have a deadline here, red line. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1811.04s)]
*  Oh, if you don't publish before some date like 2021, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  like January or 2021, then we won't include your work. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1817.04s)]
*  So we publish in August so they wouldn't include my work. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1820.96s)]
*  But they forgot to say that they claim themselves, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1823.84s)]
*  they proclaim, UN IPCC proclaim themselves [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1827.12s)]
*  to be the best of the scientific world, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1829.44s)]
*  produce the most updated and all that. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1831.92s)]
*  But immediately their report came out. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1834.32s)]
*  They already outdated because they haven't included my work. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1836.96s)]
*  Which is the most comprehensive review of how the sun affect the climate. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1840.4s)]
*  That's the work we did. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1843.92s)]
*  So this year, just two months ago, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1845.1200000000001s)]
*  we published two more paper convincingly show [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1847.3600000000001s)]
*  that even the thermometer data that they show you is not what it is. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1851.3600000000001s)]
*  It's actually not measuring climate. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1856.4s)]
*  It's measuring urban heat island changes. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1858.5600000000002s)]
*  Something that I think everybody can understand. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1861.2s)]
*  If you go to the inner part of the big city, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1863.3600000000001s)]
*  like TC is one of the best example. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1866.4s)]
*  I have graph to show that you go there, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1868.56s)]
*  inner city is much warmer than outside [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1870.56s)]
*  because of concrete retaining all the heat [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1872.6399999999999s)]
*  or you change all the surfaces or the surface become impervious [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1874.96s)]
*  between there's no breathing, no water going in and out, things like that. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1878.72s)]
*  And what we show is that it's not a phenomenon just on local science. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1883.2s)]
*  You average over this, you can see the effect [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1887.28s)]
*  all over the Northern Hemisphere. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1889.84s)]
*  This is very powerful new work that we spend. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1891.6799999999998s)]
*  Concrete and asphalt raise the temperatures more than CO2. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1894.32s)]
*  And that's what they're measuring. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1898.16s)]
*  And then they tell you this is global temperature. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1899.52s)]
*  And then we provide an alternative. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1902.0s)]
*  We say, why don't we go look at rural station that is available? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1904.72s)]
*  And guess what our result found? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1907.92s)]
*  Completely different story from the picture, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1909.44s)]
*  the narrative that's coming out from this data set, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1912.48s)]
*  thermometer data that show that combined urban and rural. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1915.6000000000001s)]
*  We show rural only. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1919.92s)]
*  We can tell you that you can immediately offer a different answer. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1921.8400000000001s)]
*  For example, it's the sun that does it. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1925.52s)]
*  We show that. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1928.72s)]
*  But we don't know that is the answer. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1929.68s)]
*  We just simply show you that the IPCC [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1931.52s)]
*  and all these so-called scientists from NASA, NOAA, and all of them [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1934.8799999999999s)]
*  are not doing their due diligence. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1938.8799999999999s)]
*  They are putting you very bad quality data product. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1941.28s)]
*  Not only that, they hide it. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1944.8s)]
*  Some of them is so difficult to get the data. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1946.08s)]
*  But it should never be difficult to get data. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1950.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, Thacker. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1952.24s)]
*  This is how the problem in science now is so many serious. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1953.52s)]
*  I thought transparency of data was science. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1956.24s)]
*  I was hoping. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1958.96s)]
*  I always believe in that. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1960.48s)]
*  That's why everything that we publish is there. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1961.92s)]
*  Because we got it from somewhere. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1965.6s)]
*  Here's the data. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1966.96s)]
*  Use it. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1967.76s)]
*  Check us. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1968.96s)]
*  If we're wrong, tell us we're wrong. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1969.44s)]
*  That is one thing that I can always promise you. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1971.04s)]
*  I'm not here to try to gain favor or anything. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1973.04s)]
*  If I'm wrong and I don't know, I tell you I don't know, Thacker. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1975.68s)]
*  A lot of these things, I'm really under a lot of careful consideration. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1978.48s)]
*  Really a lot of deep meditation thinking about this topic. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1982.24s)]
*  What I think is very problematic. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1985.68s)]
*  I'm so glad to have this opportunity to go this far [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1987.52s)]
*  to be able to talk for this long now. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1990.0s)]
*  Is that really the IPCC product is actually substandard. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1992.4s)]
*  Of course, they have a different mandate. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1996.4s)]
*  Their mandate is political, right? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=1998.08s)]
*  To provide policy. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2000.56s)]
*  We understand that. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2001.84s)]
*  But how many people really understand that [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2002.8s)]
*  pure science doesn't support anything they say? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2005.2s)]
*  I mean, in the beginning of this COP 28 meeting, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2008.16s)]
*  the chairman of this guy from UAE, United Arab Emirates, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2010.8s)]
*  the chairman, I don't know his name, Sultan Al-Jabe' or something. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2014.48s)]
*  He was saying that there's no scientific reasoning [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2018.16s)]
*  to say that we should face up for. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2020.48s)]
*  So he's right. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2021.76s)]
*  But then he back off because of all this. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2023.04s)]
*  Everybody's hurt mentality. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2026.8s)]
*  Everybody's doing a mad thing. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2028.4s)]
*  Everybody, science is not about that. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2030.0s)]
*  They all agree now. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2031.84s)]
*  They all agree to face up, right? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2032.88s)]
*  For some kind of agreement. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2034.48s)]
*  You know, that everybody declare that they're going to do that. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2036.08s)]
*  That they're going to face up for. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2039.04s)]
*  I don't even know how, actually. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2040.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2042.3200000000002s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2043.2s)]
*  And then one of the claims is that they're going to [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2044.96s)]
*  triple the amount of solar and wind power. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2047.44s)]
*  That is a sad story. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2049.44s)]
*  You know, of the amount that we spend that we can document, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2051.28s)]
*  some $3.6 trillion, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2054.88s)]
*  they spent almost $2 trillion on solar and wind power [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2058.1600000000003s)]
*  over the last, I don't know, 5, 10 years or so. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2062.0s)]
*  And then what they did is that they spent more of the money, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2065.44s)]
*  $2 trillion on solar and wind. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2068.2400000000002s)]
*  And solar and wind can only account for only 3% of the world power. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2069.92s)]
*  85% from fossil fuel, as you can see. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2074.16s)]
*  Hydropower and nuclear. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2076.64s)]
*  Nuclear is another puzzle. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2078.4s)]
*  I checked with all my nuclear expert friends [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2080.08s)]
*  that have been working for years on nuclear power. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2083.36s)]
*  Nuclear power is one of the saddest stories. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2086.32s)]
*  I believe that we actually have almost a solution in hand. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2089.04s)]
*  Not the fusion, of course. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2092.4s)]
*  It's the, you know, the fast reactor, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2094.08s)]
*  or the good generation of nuclear power. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2096.64s)]
*  Peaceful use of that won't even generate nuclear weapon. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2100.48s)]
*  We can do all of that technology. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2103.92s)]
*  The only thing barrier is red tapes. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2105.52s)]
*  Environmentally scared of radiation. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2107.3599999999997s)]
*  All these are the problem. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  We almost have all of that in hand. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2111.12s)]
*  The power can last. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2114.3199999999997s)]
*  One estimate shows that if we were to use it [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2115.44s)]
*  at the demand of that by 2050, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2118.08s)]
*  we can have enough power for 2,700 years. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2120.48s)]
*  That's far more than any of the fossil fuel can promise. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2124.0s)]
*  And then, and we're still not doing it. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2126.88s)]
*  We're not doing, America is so far behind now. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2129.28s)]
*  We just make one in Georgia, one of the nuclear plant [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2133.1200000000003s)]
*  that is so over cost because of all the red tape. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2136.88s)]
*  That is so embarrassing. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2140.32s)]
*  There are numbers. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2141.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, it costing a thousand or 2000 times [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2142.48s)]
*  even more than what Korea and, you know, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2145.6000000000004s)]
*  even Korea now is a major guy [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2148.0800000000004s)]
*  who make this nuclear power plant for any country [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2150.96s)]
*  who wants to do it, right? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2154.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, Korea, India, they are making it at much cheaper cost. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2155.6s)]
*  And the design, French design are the best, right? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2160.08s)]
*  French, they're all doing that and we're not doing it. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2162.88s)]
*  China, of course, left and right doing that. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2165.52s)]
*  But we're not doing anything. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2167.76s)]
*  We tried to tell you that we got to shut off fossil fuel, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2169.68s)]
*  increase solar and wind. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2172.32s)]
*  Are you joking? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2173.6s)]
*  Even three times more will be 9%. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2174.7200000000003s)]
*  9%. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2176.8s)]
*  I don't know, can you turn on your light only 9% or not? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2179.04s)]
*  You should shut all this light off now. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2182.8s)]
*  You're overusing it. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2184.5600000000004s)]
*  And it destroys the actual environment. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2185.6000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2187.6800000000003s)]
*  Wind farms. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2188.1600000000003s)]
*  This is a kind of a very bad incentive [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2188.8s)]
*  that they don't realize is about this kind of people [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2191.44s)]
*  that is so out of their mind in my view [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2194.1600000000003s)]
*  that they really should be cautious. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2196.96s)]
*  Somebody should just ping on their head. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2199.44s)]
*  Guys, don't keep saying those things. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2203.04s)]
*  You better think twice or consult somebody [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2205.84s)]
*  that knows something that is honest. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2208.6400000000003s)]
*  You spent 31 years at Harvard. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2211.1200000000003s)]
*  Would you be able to say this out loud at Harvard? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2213.52s)]
*  Actually, back then I also didn't care [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2216.48s)]
*  but most of the time I get called into the director's office, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2218.48s)]
*  this and that. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2222.1600000000003s)]
*  They always trying to tell, oh, why are you saying that? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2222.7200000000003s)]
*  Why are you saying this? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2224.96s)]
*  I say, well, I'm a scientist. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2225.92s)]
*  I should say whatever I want to say. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2227.1200000000003s)]
*  Not only that, the problem when I was at Harvard, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2229.1200000000003s)]
*  part of the reason I quit as I try to explain [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2231.6000000000004s)]
*  is about job requirement. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2234.32s)]
*  But another one is a bit of censorship. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2236.0s)]
*  I can only do certain thing. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2238.96s)]
*  I cannot do certain thing. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2240.88s)]
*  Like I would never be able to write paper on COVID-19. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2242.0s)]
*  I would never be able to work on, let's say, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2245.04s)]
*  environmental air pollution issues, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2248.4s)]
*  like so-called NOx or SOx and all these other things [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2250.32s)]
*  or mercury and things like that. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2253.1200000000003s)]
*  I have a lot. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2254.6400000000003s)]
*  I study a lot on those issues because I personally [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2255.28s)]
*  are concerned so I dig into the literature, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2258.0800000000004s)]
*  one thing after another. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2260.8s)]
*  Basically because I sleep very little, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2262.0800000000004s)]
*  so I really do a lot of things. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2263.68s)]
*  I flip every rock, pebbles, anything you want. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2265.2799999999997s)]
*  So I study a lot. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2267.52s)]
*  I produce a result that is good enough [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2268.7999999999997s)]
*  that can be making a lot of scientific, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2270.64s)]
*  but I never publish them because they simply won't allow. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2272.3199999999997s)]
*  They wouldn't allow you? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2275.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2277.3599999999997s)]
*  It's about a matter of allowing because they say [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2277.8399999999997s)]
*  it doesn't fit the theme of the Center for Astrophysics. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2280.0s)]
*  So I don't want to talk back about the institution, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2283.2s)]
*  but it is the finest astrophysics institution in the world. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2285.2s)]
*  In terms of instrument building, in terms of technology, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2289.3599999999997s)]
*  we can produce the best. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2292.4s)]
*  You often look at the X-ray picture of the sun. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2294.96s)]
*  Those are from very fine camera that we built [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2298.6400000000003s)]
*  that with multi-coating layers because the X-ray, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2301.6000000000004s)]
*  they come in very slowly and then they're going to diffuse, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2304.7200000000003s)]
*  come out, but we make very fine way to catch them [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2307.44s)]
*  so they can come out so the image are crystal clear. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2310.0s)]
*  You can see all the structure on the sun. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2312.56s)]
*  It's made by my center. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2314.96s)]
*  They're good scientists except that when it comes down [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2316.8s)]
*  to a larger picture of science, shh, shh, don't say this, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2319.12s)]
*  don't say that, this and that, and then all of that. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2322.88s)]
*  This is why even at Harvard, I quit taking money from NASA [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2325.12s)]
*  and NSF, all these other place in 2004 [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2329.2s)]
*  because I beginning to think that science being so unaccountable, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2332.56s)]
*  funded by taxpayer that all these people, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2336.48s)]
*  it's so unconscionable. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2339.12s)]
*  So I personally chose that. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2340.64s)]
*  That is nobody to blame but myself, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2341.92s)]
*  but I chose to take only from foundation [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2344.3199999999997s)]
*  who are willing to give me money. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2346.88s)]
*  So I wrote those kinds of proposal and then got to go through [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2349.2s)]
*  the director's office, this and that, right? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2351.8399999999997s)]
*  I have a very, very happy and fruitful career. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2354.08s)]
*  Everybody can look up my publication list. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2356.48s)]
*  It's very long. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2358.3199999999997s)]
*  And not only that, it's not the number that counts. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2359.3599999999997s)]
*  It's the quality of the paper. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2362.16s)]
*  I always want to remind people. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2363.92s)]
*  I don't like talking about how many thousands of paper [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2365.52s)]
*  you write, this and that. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2367.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not important. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2368.56s)]
*  Which paper that is really important for certain issues. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2370.16s)]
*  That's important that if you are able to show that, that's good. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2372.64s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2375.92s)]
*  All my papers are basically under a lot of this serious, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2376.88s)]
*  serious thinking and serious evaluation, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2380.32s)]
*  checking and rechecking before I would care to write [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2382.2400000000002s)]
*  about anything because you don't want to write [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2384.6400000000003s)]
*  anything that's wrong tomorrow. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2386.7200000000003s)]
*  You want something that can write. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2388.8s)]
*  But science is basically garbage can now. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2390.6400000000003s)]
*  These scientific papers, I categorically would even [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2392.88s)]
*  make this statement. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  I will make the statement that about 80 to 90% [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2397.52s)]
*  of the paper published in so-called climate science today [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2400.32s)]
*  should not be published. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2404.48s)]
*  But everybody have NSF grant. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2406.56s)]
*  Everybody have all these grants. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2409.7599999999998s)]
*  You see how the inflation goes. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2410.96s)]
*  Just like the other day, you hear that Yale University, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2412.56s)]
*  large part of it, most of the students on 22 or something [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2416.64s)]
*  all got grade A grade. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2421.2s)]
*  You know, grade A, they diluted the grade. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2422.56s)]
*  But Harvey Rich assured me that in medical sciences [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2424.88s)]
*  and hard sciences, Harvey Rich is the professor [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2427.44s)]
*  at Yale University. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2429.68s)]
*  He teach in the medical school. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2430.64s)]
*  So he say, no, not true. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2432.24s)]
*  So he tried to assure me he has quality. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2433.84s)]
*  Maybe not in his class, but Harvey not in any other class. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2437.2000000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2440.2400000000002s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2440.88s)]
*  So I want to ask you, this is kind of last topic, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2441.6000000000004s)]
*  which is not related to this, but we talked about it [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2443.92s)]
*  off the air and I think it's really interesting. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2446.08s)]
*  You were telling me that you see God or evidence of God [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2448.4s)]
*  in math. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2453.76s)]
*  Well, can you explain what you were saying? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2455.84s)]
*  Maybe I misread what you were saying. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2459.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no, you did not. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2460.48s)]
*  I mean, I have been closer and closer to God [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2461.84s)]
*  in the sense that because it takes me a long time, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2465.36s)]
*  I'm rather rebellious. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2467.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, I have to say, damn it, God, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2468.7200000000003s)]
*  you've got to prove it to me. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2470.48s)]
*  Show it to me, buddy. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2472.0s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2473.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry to anybody. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2475.1200000000003s)]
*  No, no. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2476.1600000000003s)]
*  But I really say it in that way. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2477.28s)]
*  You know, you talk to yourself in a sense. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2479.04s)]
*  But in many, many moments in history of physics [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2481.04s)]
*  or mathematics, things come out. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2484.08s)]
*  You see, mathematics, you know, is this very pure word [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2486.2400000000002s)]
*  that it seems to have no connection to real world physics. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2488.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2491.2s)]
*  It's true. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2491.8399999999997s)]
*  It's complex numbers. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2492.3199999999997s)]
*  One of them is, but it appears in quantum mechanics. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2493.2799999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2495.6s)]
*  It's so beautiful. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2495.8399999999997s)]
*  But one of the things that sometimes you see in equation [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2496.8799999999997s)]
*  is so amazing when you formulate, you know, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2500.16s)]
*  maybe it's not right. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2502.16s)]
*  Maybe it's this and that. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2503.04s)]
*  Maybe, you know, you doubt yourself. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2503.8399999999997s)]
*  But one of the most beautiful equation [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2505.6s)]
*  was the one that derived by Paul Dirac. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2507.68s)]
*  He's a professor at Cambridge University, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2510.08s)]
*  but he retired in Florida, by the way. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2511.9199999999996s)]
*  He died in Florida, Tallahassee. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2513.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's a refuge for him because he doesn't like to talk. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2516.96s)]
*  He would sit there for five days and don't talk. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2520.08s)]
*  One day, all of a sudden, he talked. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2522.16s)]
*  But anyway, he formulated that he's a beautiful man. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2523.68s)]
*  He, you know, Paul Dirac, he formulated this relativistic [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2525.84s)]
*  equation for electrons. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2529.12s)]
*  But in one of the equations, the solution [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2531.2s)]
*  come out to be a negative sign. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2533.36s)]
*  Not only that, there's a square root involved. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2536.08s)]
*  So it's strange behavior. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2537.76s)]
*  There's a negative sign in law. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2539.44s)]
*  But it has to have the exact property, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2540.8s)]
*  like an electron and all that stuff. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2543.44s)]
*  How come? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2546.48s)]
*  Everybody say, you crazy, you stupid, this and that, right? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2548.08s)]
*  He is not even wait. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2551.92s)]
*  He didn't know sweat, buddy. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  He just say, I am right. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2555.7599999999998s)]
*  Many years later, a few years later, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2558.3199999999997s)]
*  it is shown in Caltech by Carl Anderson [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2560.72s)]
*  to show there's actually such a thing called positron. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2562.88s)]
*  You know, the opposite, the brothers of electron. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2565.3599999999997s)]
*  That's such a thing. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2568.24s)]
*  And then if you ask yourself, how is it possible? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2570.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2573.6s)]
*  That's something, this is out of nowhere. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2574.4s)]
*  Where does this thing come from? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2577.2000000000003s)]
*  And then in mathematical sciences, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2578.8s)]
*  there's a lot of things like this, like geometry. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2580.4s)]
*  There's an even more famous thing about in geometry [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2582.88s)]
*  is called Calabi-Yau Manifold that related to string theory. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2585.44s)]
*  This thing was basically a revisit of Einstein's [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2589.92s)]
*  general relativity equation, asking itself [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2592.64s)]
*  whether is it possible to have close curvature in space time [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2595.52s)]
*  that you actually don't require even gravity to be there. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2600.0s)]
*  And they show that Calabi was trying to prove this yaw, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2604.64s)]
*  Xing Dong-Yau is one of the great mathematician. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2607.84s)]
*  He's at Harvard, but he retired. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2609.84s)]
*  Now he go to China. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2611.44s)]
*  He was the one who tried to disprove this thing, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2613.44s)]
*  but he turns out to be true. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2615.76s)]
*  That is true that you can have close curvature in space time [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2617.76s)]
*  that without gravity even. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2623.04s)]
*  So that added even more reach in this world [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2625.2000000000003s)]
*  that from mathematics to real world, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2628.48s)]
*  we already have in our hard time understanding Einstein. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2630.96s)]
*  This guy added even more. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2633.44s)]
*  His discovery was in the 70s and things like that. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2635.04s)]
*  There's so many examples and incidents like this. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2638.48s)]
*  Just have to tell you that you have to bow down. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2641.36s)]
*  You have to occasionally take a deep breath. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2643.92s)]
*  There may be some ever presence of these forces [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2647.04s)]
*  that allow us to illuminate our life. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2650.64s)]
*  And I tell you, God has given us all this light [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2654.0s)]
*  that tell us that we have to follow the light [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2657.52s)]
*  and do the best we can rather than everyday devouring [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2659.68s)]
*  planet Earth saying that we are the Satan, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2663.52s)]
*  we are the evil people. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2665.6s)]
*  These people are constantly trying to make all of us [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2667.44s)]
*  a lesser human being. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2671.76s)]
*  I would never allow them anyway. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2673.52s)]
*  So good luck for those people like Al Gore and all that [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2675.84s)]
*  who think that they're high and mighty [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2679.12s)]
*  and trying to always, always lecture us [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2681.04s)]
*  and kind of cut down on fossil fuel [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2683.04s)]
*  because we're going to hurt the planet Earth. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2685.92s)]
*  I say, Al Gore, do you ever think twice? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2688.96s)]
*  Who are you to think that you can actually [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2692.2400000000002s)]
*  try to save the planet Earth even? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2694.8s)]
*  Because they always use the word, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2696.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm trying to save the planet Earth. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2697.84s)]
*  I don't know who gives them the right [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2699.36s)]
*  to save the planet Earth. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2700.64s)]
*  Same with this experiment that they're trying to do, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2702.32s)]
*  by the way, the experiment to say [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2704.2400000000002s)]
*  that we must cut down CO2 emission. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2705.76s)]
*  I told you CO2 is good for life. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2707.52s)]
*  Because I asked Al Gore, indeed when I asked Al Gore [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2711.6s)]
*  the question in UC Santa Barbara is what? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2713.68s)]
*  Is that CO2 is gas of life. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2716.88s)]
*  Who gives you the audacity to cut down this? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2719.2799999999997s)]
*  Then aren't you, are you going to be responsible [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2721.7599999999998s)]
*  for the ecological and humanitarian, all this crisis? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2724.16s)]
*  Even we know rising CO2 affect even plants, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2727.6s)]
*  especially food production. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2732.0s)]
*  Maybe not exact number we know, but it does positively. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2734.24s)]
*  We have technology to help it, better seed, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2738.56s)]
*  better all this fertilization, all these other things. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2740.96s)]
*  But who gives them the idea to do that, to cut down it? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2743.92s)]
*  Because it's generally going to be good for life. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2747.04s)]
*  Because you have to push them around, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2750.0s)]
*  because nobody should give them the authority. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2751.84s)]
*  So far, I don't think anyone can answer that question for me. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2754.0s)]
*  So I tell them to please bow down to God. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2757.2s)]
*  Really answer to that question first, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2759.52s)]
*  before you do anything else. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2761.12s)]
*  Because it's ridiculous for them to keep, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2762.72s)]
*  to claim that they have the upper moral [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2764.96s)]
*  and ethical high ground to try to prescribe everybody [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2768.0s)]
*  to live in certain condition that they chose. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2771.84s)]
*  But they themselves don't follow the rules. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2774.8s)]
*  They tell us to take a bus. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2777.12s)]
*  Elgo, always tell me, even tell me what to take a bus, Elgo. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2778.88s)]
*  My God, I say, Elgo, you take a bus from Tennessee to Massachusetts, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2782.16s)]
*  I'll be waiting for you down there. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2785.36s)]
*  Please. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2786.96s)]
*  I mean, this guy is just out of the, out of the, out of this world, man. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2788.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, Elgo, but you can still call me. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2792.8s)]
*  Can you, Willie Soon, thank you. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2796.08s)]
*  But before you go, last thing for viewers [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2799.36s)]
*  who want to know more about what you do, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2801.68s)]
*  can you say once again where they can read it? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2804.08s)]
*  I hope that I don't disappoint anyone, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2807.68s)]
*  but please come to series.sign.com [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2809.9199999999996s)]
*  and I want to make one plug for my good friend, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2813.9199999999996s)]
*  How Shirt Lift, as I get older and older, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2816.72s)]
*  including my own kids, my own kids, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2820.24s)]
*  three kids has been going to the CAM Constitution at New Hampshire. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2822.0s)]
*  And we also wanted to invite Tucker Carlson to come [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2825.8399999999997s)]
*  because Vivek Ravaswamy came last summer. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2829.7599999999998s)]
*  And because we are very, very small group, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2833.04s)]
*  we are a tiny little group called CAM Constitution. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2835.04s)]
*  So CAMConstitution.net. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2837.52s)]
*  We offer basically family kind of a Christian kind of a background, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2839.68s)]
*  but we don't talk about Christ all the time, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2843.68s)]
*  but we talk about Bibles, we talk about Constitution, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2845.2799999999997s)]
*  we talk about science. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2848.4s)]
*  So I'm the science instructor. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2849.44s)]
*  I've been doing that for almost six, seven years now. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2851.2799999999997s)]
*  So I've been doing every year, I will give one or two classes, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2854.0s)]
*  depends on how many, whatever they want me to do, I'll do. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2856.72s)]
*  And my own kids came to those things. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7IdLzxzINw&t=2859.7599999999998s)]
