# Tulsi Gabbard on Donald Trump, Corruption in Congress, and Who’s Puppeteering Our Politicians
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8)
*  So try to think back to 2013. It wasn't that long ago. We had air travel and electricity and air conditioning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=0.0s)]
*  It was part of the modern era [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=8.0s)]
*  2013 Tulsi Gabbard who was in her early 30s had just been elected from Hawaii [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=9.88s)]
*  She was a member of Congress first-term or a Democrat and not just a Democrat. She was the single most famous [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=14.92s)]
*  Freshman that year and she was feted by her party the Democratic Party made her vice chair of the DNC as a freshman [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=22.86s)]
*  That year and she was on the cover of magazine. She was the future of the Democratic Party. It was [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=30.08s)]
*  2013 fast forward [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=37.02s)]
*  11 years to the beginning of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  2024 that very same person was a headliner at CPAC the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=43.08s)]
*  Conservative Political Action Committee and not only did she speak there [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=48.74s)]
*  She was arguably the most popular person who spoke there this year 11 years later. Here's part of what she said [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=51.44s)]
*  Our democracy is under attack [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=58.4s)]
*  The perpetrators of this attack are those [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=62.32s)]
*  Who in the name of saving our democracy are destroying it? I [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=66.36s)]
*  Don't use these words lightly every one of us who loves this country and who cherishes peace and freedom [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=72.08s)]
*  Should be very alarmed by those who driven by their insatiable hunger for power are [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=79.72s)]
*  Actively undermining all that we stand for and almost every single day if you're paying attention to the news and the headlines [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=86.16s)]
*  There is some new assault and some new attack [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Now it's the Democrat elite and the swamp creatures in Washington who are doing all that they possibly [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=96.88s)]
*  Can to keep us the American people from a very simple thing having the freedom to choose who we want to be our next [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=102.12s)]
*  president [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=109.92s)]
*  And it is clear through their actions [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=115.56s)]
*  They have no respect for us and they have no respect for our fundamental rights as citizens of this Democratic Republic [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=118.08s)]
*  They are so terrified that we the people may make what they think is the wrong choice [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=126.6s)]
*  That in the name of protecting democracy and saving us from ourselves, they're actually destroying our democracy and taking away our freedom [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=135.04s)]
*  Wow, you can see why she was the most popular speaker at CPAC this year [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=143.84s)]
*  But again 11 years from vice chair of the DNC to headlining CPAC. Some people have asked well, wait a second [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=148.48s)]
*  That's awfully fast. This must be an op. She must be a secret lefty or a CIA agent [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=155.8s)]
*  Well, of course, we can't know [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=162.56s)]
*  But if she was she'd probably be getting something out of it [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=165.28s)]
*  She'd be really rich but no Tulsi Gabbard is probably the least rich famous person in the United States [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=168.82s)]
*  She is not cashed in just the opposite. She's actually really suffered [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=173.34s)]
*  for her change of heart, so what was the process that led her from [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=177.02s)]
*  Freshman in Congress 11 years ago to headliner at CPAC this year. It's a very interesting story and she's written in a book [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=183.1s)]
*  There's just come out for love of country leave the Democratic Party behind and she's joining us today to explain [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=189.22s)]
*  What exactly happened in her life? Tulsi Gabbard joins us now. Thank you [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=195.34s)]
*  Thank you so much and congrats on the book and I have to say the first thing that jumped up Tulsi is one of the most [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=198.78s)]
*  rock-solid [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=204.18s)]
*  honorable people I've ever met says Joe Rogan and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=205.5s)]
*  I can attest that that is true. I feel the same way. Thank you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=209.58s)]
*  So but I can also see why people like what is this? Yeah, Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=214.46s)]
*  Probably the most reliably Democratic liberal state [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=221.5s)]
*  Argument there may be but subjective but pretty close if not the most and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=224.82s)]
*  Now this like what happened? It's it's you know, a lot has happened in that 11 year [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=229.74s)]
*  Yes, you're talking I'm just thinking through like gosh has it only been [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=235.1s)]
*  Has it only been a lot 10 11 years, but it to me it just shows how? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=239.26s)]
*  Insane today's Democratic Party has become yes, really truly, you know, I joined the Democratic Party [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  In [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=252.06s)]
*  2002 I was 21 years old when I ran for the state house in Hawaii [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=253.34s)]
*  And as you know, I come from you know, my parents have are very independent minded people [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=257.38s)]
*  They raised all of us five kids to be critical thinkers and independent minded make make your own decision [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=262.94s)]
*  But do your research and figure out why you are coming to this conclusion or why you were coming to this decision [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  And so when I had decided to run for office in Hawaii [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=275.02s)]
*  There wasn't just like well, of course [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=278.1s)]
*  I'm gonna be a part of this party or that party because you know [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=279.82s)]
*  Somebody told me to her because it was like a family generational thing. None of that was there [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  And so I really started to look at [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=286.54s)]
*  You know Hawaii's history in politics [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=289.22s)]
*  Why was Hawaii such a strong Democratic state as it still is now? It's it's a little bit less so but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=291.94s)]
*  at that time what I saw was a party that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=299.26s)]
*  Welcomed free thinkers it was truly a big tent party even in their own words [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=303.18s)]
*  It was a party that stood up for civil liberties [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  It's a party that stood up for freedom of speech and was willing to fight for it. That is true [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=312.22s)]
*  It was a party that in Hawaii's history fought for working people fought for average everyday Americans [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=316.3s)]
*  Against the the corporate industrial complex which in Hawaii was the big four plantation owners back in the day and so [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=323.42s)]
*  It was because of those reasons and looking at leaders like JFK [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=332.18s)]
*  For people aren't familiar with the history of the state which is actually very interesting [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=336.66s)]
*  It is completely different from the history of any other of the 49 states. Yes. It was almost like a feudal system [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=339.58s)]
*  Yeah in Hawaii. Is that fair? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=345.54s)]
*  It was it was and going back and this is where there was a big shift and and people in the political world ask all [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=347.06s)]
*  The time is like why? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=354.1s)]
*  Why did Hawaii become such a strong Democrat state? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=355.86s)]
*  It was because there were four major landowners that came in and essentially took the land [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=359.14s)]
*  from the local people [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=364.94s)]
*  through the Queen in jail and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=367.06s)]
*  Decided okay. Well, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna start growing sugarcane [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  we're gonna go start growing pineapples and they essentially installed themselves as the government of what was then the territory of Hawaii and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=372.54s)]
*  Local people really didn't have a whole lot of say in it [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=381.94s)]
*  But through that process there were immigrants coming from Japan and from the Philippines from Portugal from places all over the world [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=384.18s)]
*  seeking opportunity getting work visas and work contracts to go and work in the fields and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=391.94s)]
*  These massive plantation owners essentially treated them like crap [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=397.62s)]
*  subhuman living conditions abysmal pay and and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=402.38s)]
*  Essentially what what we would call complete abuse in in in this day and age [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=406.74s)]
*  But they got away with it because they the people had no voice [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=412.38s)]
*  When one group started to rise up and say hey, we got to stick together and demand better living conditions and better pay [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=417.3s)]
*  Let's say it was the Filipinos who did it and they said, okay, well fine [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=423.62s)]
*  We're just gonna have the Japanese workers come in and take over your fields and leave you with nothing [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=427.06s)]
*  And so pitting one group against the other so in Hawaii it was [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=432.42s)]
*  It was the ILWU union primarily that came in and actually started to organize workers and there was a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=436.58000000000004s)]
*  couple of Democrat political leaders who had failed at the polls previously because they didn't have the votes they came in and said hey [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=444.66s)]
*  Look, we're gonna fight for you and they did and that was when Hawaii shifted from [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=452.14s)]
*  Republican to Democrat control because the Democrat Party at that time was the party of the people [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=456.58000000000004s)]
*  Didn't matter where you were from didn't matter your background how much money you made or didn't made your education or anything else [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=462.42s)]
*  They were the party of the people [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=467.46s)]
*  battling against the the the elite and so so I this the reason why this story is important is because [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=469.74s)]
*  You look at that [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  Legacy in my home state of Hawaii and then you look at what's happening in our politics today [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=480.5s)]
*  where [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=486.82s)]
*  unfortunately the Democrat Party [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  And those in charge of it are now the party of the elite [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=490.97999999999996s)]
*  Who are way out of touch with the experience of everyday working people across this country? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  and and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=502.5s)]
*  It is unfortunate [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=504.14s)]
*  It is unfortunate that that party has gotten so far away from its roots [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=506.3s)]
*  Its roots of being a party that celebrated freedom its roots of being a party that fought for for civil liberties to one now where [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=511.06s)]
*  With the Biden-Harris administration and the Democrat elite across Washington are [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=518.38s)]
*  Intentionally [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=525.6999999999999s)]
*  politicizing and weaponizing the tools of our own government and their friends in big tech and social media and their friends in the mainstream media [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=527.6999999999999s)]
*  To take away our freedoms to take away our right to free speech to violate our privacy and our civil liberties [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=535.74s)]
*  They have become the party of war [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=543.5799999999999s)]
*  in in every respect [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=546.82s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Democrat Party has become a party that is is [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=550.1s)]
*  undermining the very fabric of our country of our freedom of our Constitution and the rule of law [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=554.7s)]
*  Which is why ultimately I left the Democratic Party and am why it's why I am sounding the alarm bells as we head [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=561.46s)]
*  Into this very critical election year about really what's at stake [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=569.74s)]
*  The reason that I know you're sincere is [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=573.82s)]
*  Because you left the Democratic Party at exactly the moment that it solidified its position as the party of the rich [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=576.58s)]
*  Yeah, and there's so many rewards that you can receive if you sign up [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=581.7s)]
*  So I I know a million people who've moved in the other direction [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=586.22s)]
*  You know Joe Scarborough or Stuart Stevens or Steve Schmidt or all the guys from the Lincoln project Bill Crystal, right? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=588.1800000000001s)]
*  And they've all been rewarded for it a lot because there's a lot of money to pass around if you do that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=594.34s)]
*  You left at exactly the moment when you could have gotten kind of rich by staying and reading the talking points [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=600.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it even I first got elected in [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=606.86s)]
*  2012 it was it was it was a race that I was not supposed to win if you listen to anybody who know anything about politics [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=610.7800000000001s)]
*  And I won that election [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=618.34s)]
*  Zero support from any you know local or national Democratic Party individuals or the party as a whole [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=622.5400000000001s)]
*  It was imagine this [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=629.1s)]
*  the people's voices were heard through their votes and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=632.38s)]
*  they were sick and tired of the pay-to-play corrupt politics and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=635.9s)]
*  Wanted a new direction and a fresh direction of leadership and so it was it was a hard-fought [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=642.9s)]
*  Election, but I I had no idea what was in store when I actually went to Washington. So what did you notice? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=649.26s)]
*  I mean, well, first of all, obviously very far away. It's just so far it is [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=655.94s)]
*  It is and you would think in the age of technology that distance wouldn't matter so much but it kind of does that does some way [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=662.5s)]
*  But shortly after my primary election, I got a call from Nancy Pelosi saying hey, do you want to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  Speak during primetime at the Democratic Convention coming up and I was like [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=676.1s)]
*  Yes, how old were you I was 31 what a trip that was and I said I would like to speak about veterans [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=681.74s)]
*  I was serving in the Hawaii National Guard at the time. I'm still serving the US Army Reserve now, but to me [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=689.54s)]
*  Hey, here's an opportunity to speak to millions of people across the country [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=695.42s)]
*  About the people who are nearest and dearest to my heart my brothers and sisters [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=699.3s)]
*  And so the whole thing was it was quite surreal because I didn't I didn't seek it out [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=703.78s)]
*  I didn't know I didn't know how that machine worked, but I found myself getting these phone calls [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=708.9s)]
*  from people within the Democratic Party like [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=716.86s)]
*  Hey go and speak at this like [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=720.22s)]
*  Premier event that like most people don't get invitations to and a couple of weeks after I was in office [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=723.1800000000001s)]
*  I got a call saying hey [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=729.74s)]
*  What would you say if you were asked to serve as vice chair of the DNC? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=731.22s)]
*  And I was just literally my response was like what is a vice chair of the DNC do I don't know nothing about this [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=735.06s)]
*  What what do you really want for me? What are you asking of me? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=741.42s)]
*  Ultimately said yes, because this is an opportunity to be in a position to make some positive change [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=744.8599999999999s)]
*  But these kinds of things kept on happening [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=750.42s)]
*  over [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=753.7399999999999s)]
*  Over the yeah, it's kind of my first year first couple years in office [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=755.26s)]
*  But and you'll appreciate this [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=759.8599999999999s)]
*  One of the major turning points [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=762.5s)]
*  that started to slow down the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=765.1800000000001s)]
*  the fanfare and and like the the headlines of like I remember there was one at the Democratic Convention, I [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=768.46s)]
*  Don't know if it was CNN or MSN. Some of someone's like [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=776.22s)]
*  Oh, I wonder who's gonna play Tulsi Gabbard in a movie like all this stuff like this is so weird [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=778.7s)]
*  But that summer of 2013 my first year in Congress [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=783.82s)]
*  as [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=788.86s)]
*  You know one of the main reasons that I ran for Congress was because of the experiences that I'd had on both of my Middle East [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=789.98s)]
*  deployments [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=796.82s)]
*  Where I experienced the cost of war firsthand serving in a medical unit and I wanted to be in a position [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=798.0600000000001s)]
*  Where I could help [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=804.3000000000001s)]
*  influence and impact those foreign policy decisions that were directly impacting [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=806.2600000000001s)]
*  my brothers and sisters in uniform, I [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=811.86s)]
*  Didn't realize that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=815.3000000000001s)]
*  My opportunity to be able to do that would happen so quickly [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=818.3s)]
*  but it was August of 2013 that President Obama announced then President Obama announced that he was [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=821.9799999999999s)]
*  Going to seek authorization to use military force from Congress to go and drop some bombs on Syria in [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=827.4599999999999s)]
*  what would be kind of the first volley of regime change war there and [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=832.74s)]
*  I was on the Foreign Affairs Committee at the time [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=838.78s)]
*  August most members of Congress are at home during recess and I was home in my district and I remember like it was yesterday [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=842.48s)]
*  pumping gas at the gas station and this woman came up to me and [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=850.68s)]
*  I've never met her before [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=855.9599999999999s)]
*  local local lady came she grabbed my arm and [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=857.8s)]
*  Looked at me with this [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=861.9599999999999s)]
*  intensity in her eyes [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  Telling me that her son had just come home from Iraq and [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=866.32s)]
*  She had been terrified that he wouldn't come home [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=873.0400000000001s)]
*  He was finally home with her and now they wanted to they wanted to send him back to another war in [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  Another country and begged me. Please Tulsi. Don't let them take my son from me [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=884.12s)]
*  she's and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=890.8800000000001s)]
*  And [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=893.84s)]
*  As the next couple of days went on I would bump into more people like that in the supermarket or just around town [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=895.96s)]
*  Who were absolutely terrified? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=905.28s)]
*  I went back to Washington. We held all the committee hearings open hearings classified briefings [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=908.24s)]
*  And I went in with an open mind and give me all of the information [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=914.64s)]
*  I [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  want to make sure that I do my due diligence before I take a position or make a decision on this and [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=920.9200000000001s)]
*  ultimately [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=927.28s)]
*  Secretary Kerry came in and briefed us the answers to very direct questions that I had such as [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=928.9200000000001s)]
*  What is our objective? What what is your objective in wanting to go and start another war in another country? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=936.52s)]
*  What do you how do you think they will respond? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=944.4399999999999s)]
*  What will you do next? What is that second third fourth order of effects and consequences that will always happen? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=948.52s)]
*  And the the the question [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=956.68s)]
*  You know when I said what is your objective? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=959.36s)]
*  I believe it was secretary Kerry or someone from the State Department who said well, you know, we don't want to deliver a [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=962.4s)]
*  Decapitation we don't want it to be a pinprick. We want this to be a punch in the gut and send a message and [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=970.16s)]
*  My question was okay. So a punch in the gut [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=977.24s)]
*  like [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=981.36s)]
*  What will you do when they respond? They said well, we don't think they'll we don't think there'll be a response [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=982.8s)]
*  That's your plan you don't think there will be a response [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=989.0s)]
*  Gary said if somebody came up and punched you in the gut, would you like just not respond? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=992.88s)]
*  If they don't respond they've got some pretty you know weaponized powerful friends [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=998.32s)]
*  You don't think they'll respond and what if they don't respond to us [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1003.84s)]
*  But they respond by attacking some of our friends who may be in the region all of these different kinds of questions [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1007.08s)]
*  There's like well, we just don't think they'll do that. Well, what happens next? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1012.72s)]
*  Well, you know, we think this will send a strong message and and it's the same kind of like political [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1016.08s)]
*  BS talk [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1023.36s)]
*  That means nothing and is so disconnected from the reality of the people on the ground [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1025.36s)]
*  Who have to live with those consequences? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1031.4799999999998s)]
*  And it really surprised me and maybe I shouldn't have been surprised but it surprised me that after so many years of [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1034.7199999999998s)]
*  Looking back at the massive mistakes of Iraq that they could be so glib and just saying [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1041.84s)]
*  Oh, we'll just go drop some bombs and send a message and and that'll be it [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1047.76s)]
*  They learned nothing they learned nothing and so I I penned an op-ed and published it and [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1051.96s)]
*  I was I was certainly the first Democrat [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1058.68s)]
*  maybe the first member of Congress to come out in opposition to President Obama's request and [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1062.0s)]
*  Within hours of publishing that op-ed. I got a call from the White House [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1068.2s)]
*  and essentially [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1073.72s)]
*  What they said was [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1076.68s)]
*  What they said was how dare you how dare you go against your president [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1078.72s)]
*  How dare you go against the president who came from your home state? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1084.72s)]
*  Not a moment of the conversation. There wasn't much of a conversation first of all [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1090.16s)]
*  But they were not interested at all in the reason for my opposition [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1095.16s)]
*  Which I I stated pretty clearly in the op-ed how how well [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1099.8400000000001s)]
*  Thought out this decision was it was not made haphazardly [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1103.72s)]
*  They weren't interested in my experience that I brought that helped inform my decision of having deployed twice to the Middle East before [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1108.08s)]
*  And it it told me a lot about them that they were more [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1115.64s)]
*  Concerned with and they cared more about like being a good member of the team and go team Obama and go team Democrats [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1120.08s)]
*  Then they were concerned about [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1127.4s)]
*  The actual consequences of the very serious request that he was [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1129.4s)]
*  Saying he would come to Congress with it sent a strong message to them as well [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1134.68s)]
*  That I wasn't the person that they thought I was going to be and in someone who could be [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1141.3600000000001s)]
*  puppeteered who could be bullied into [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1147.5600000000002s)]
*  Just going along with the boss or whatever they had in mind [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1150.52s)]
*  That was kind of the beginning of their realization that okay [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1155.2s)]
*  This one thinks for herself, and she's not afraid to take a stand so I mean at that point [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1159.56s)]
*  You know they have two options. They can either try and crush you your freshmen so early for that [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1164.52s)]
*  They've also ginned up the publicity machine on your behalf. You probably weren't even aware of this, but [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1169.24s)]
*  Most people come most congressmen come to Washington. No one ever hears. No one knows they're there. Yeah, I [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1174.24s)]
*  Know you were there. Yeah [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1179.3s)]
*  So they can try and crush you or they can try and suborn you bribe you give you stuff to win you over [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1181.44s)]
*  Yeah, what did they try? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1187.64s)]
*  You know it's it is kind of the public things like I remember, and I think you'll get a kick out of this being invited to [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1191.44s)]
*  The White House correspondence dinner my first year in Congress [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1198.1s)]

*  how come you got invited? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1212.6799999999998s)]
*  I've been here for four terms, eight years, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1213.9199999999998s)]
*  and I still haven't gotten invited to that. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1216.48s)]
*  And I was like, do you want to go? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1219.1999999999998s)]
*  I really don't like going to these kind of things. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1223.6799999999998s)]
*  I hate these big kind of parties and social things. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1225.72s)]
*  Like, you can have my seat. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1227.9199999999998s)]
*  But it was that kind of thing where, oh, go to this embassy [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1229.52s)]
*  for this fancy party. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1233.86s)]
*  Like, all this stuff that, unfortunately, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1234.78s)]
*  too many members of Congress find very, very appealing [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1238.1799999999998s)]
*  and get some kind of, I don't know, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1243.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to use the word fulfillment, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1248.6999999999998s)]
*  because it's not fulfilling. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1250.58s)]
*  But I guess it's what they want. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1251.82s)]
*  And I didn't want any of that. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1255.86s)]
*  So the things that they were putting before me [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1257.82s)]
*  were not attractive to me at all. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1263.02s)]
*  And it all kind of definitely came crashing down in 2016 [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1265.82s)]
*  when I took a step to go after Hillary Clinton [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1274.06s)]
*  when she was running for president in the Democratic [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1279.62s)]
*  primary. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1281.74s)]
*  I was vice chair of the DNC. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1282.24s)]
*  And I saw that the mainstream media, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1283.58s)]
*  they were all saying she was the most qualified person ever [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1289.46s)]
*  to run for president and listing out all of the titles [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1291.96s)]
*  that she has held. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1295.08s)]
*  But not a single one of them was questioning or holding [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1295.88s)]
*  her to account for her record on foreign policy [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1299.88s)]
*  or challenging her on what kind of commander in chief [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1302.68s)]
*  she would be. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1306.0s)]
*  Or the job that she had done in any of those jobs. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1306.56s)]
*  Like, that was irrelevant. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1308.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1309.52s)]
*  The actual record of what happened. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1310.28s)]
*  Tell us what happened in Libya, actually, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1312.8s)]
*  for her pushing for the regime change in Libya [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1316.24s)]
*  and what happened as a consequence. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1319.92s)]
*  There are so many different examples. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1321.44s)]
*  For sure. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1323.0800000000002s)]
*  So you said that out loud. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1324.24s)]
*  What happened then? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1325.52s)]
*  I resigned as vice chair of the DNC. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1327.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1331.3200000000002s)]
*  Because the rules said that as officer of the DNC, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1332.8s)]
*  you can't take sides in a partisan primary. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1336.1200000000001s)]
*  The DNC itself under Debbie Wasserman clearly [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1341.64s)]
*  was in every way, tilting the scales for Hillary Clinton. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1344.24s)]
*  But I resigned as vice chair of the DNC [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1349.68s)]
*  and endorsed Bernie Sanders around this single issue [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1351.4s)]
*  of foreign policy. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1354.24s)]
*  Specifically because while I disagreed with Bernie [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1355.64s)]
*  on a bunch of things, he was certainly [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1359.04s)]
*  more of a non-interventionist than the warmonger [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1363.44s)]
*  that Hillary Clinton is. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1368.2s)]
*  And I knew that would provide me with a platform [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1370.0s)]
*  to have a voice and actually speak the truth [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1372.64s)]
*  to the American people about her record [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1375.0800000000002s)]
*  and how dangerous she would be if she were ever our president [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1378.48s)]
*  and how personal this was for me because the cost is real. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1383.56s)]
*  So what happened when you did that? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1390.6s)]
*  I announced it on Meet the Press on a Sunday morning. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1394.4s)]
*  Didn't tell anybody I was doing it, no one, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1398.28s)]
*  before I went and made that announcement on that show. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1401.24s)]
*  Monday morning came back to work. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1405.4s)]
*  And a lot of my Democrat colleagues [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1408.12s)]
*  were basically reading, drafting their political eulogies [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1411.12s)]
*  for me, just like, you're done. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1418.72s)]
*  You're done, Tulsi. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1421.12s)]
*  Hillary will be president. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1422.8799999999999s)]
*  You will not get a single dime for your district, anything [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1424.24s)]
*  that your community needs. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1427.6399999999999s)]
*  For your district? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1428.96s)]
*  For my district. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1429.76s)]
*  Not for your campaign? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1430.44s)]
*  Not for me, for my district. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1431.32s)]
*  They've never given me anything for any of my campaigns. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1433.04s)]
*  And I'm totally fine with that. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1435.6s)]
*  But that my district and my constituency in Hawaii [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1438.6399999999999s)]
*  would be punished for doing what I did. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1442.04s)]
*  I also learned that there is an actual list of people [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1446.36s)]
*  who are blacklisted, I suppose. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1450.36s)]
*  And I was told that it would take years and years and years [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1456.12s)]
*  to ever work my way off that list. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1459.08s)]
*  I was chuckling at all of that. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1462.1599999999999s)]
*  So they said this out loud? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1463.48s)]
*  They thought this? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1464.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1464.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1465.48s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1465.96s)]
*  These were many conversations, walking to and from votes [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1466.8400000000001s)]
*  with different people who were pulling me aside [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1469.72s)]
*  and offering their condolences, their political condolences [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1472.64s)]
*  to me. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1475.72s)]
*  Because I had made a decision that they [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1476.92s)]
*  said would be equal to the death of my political future. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1480.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1486.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1488.3600000000001s)]
*  MSNBC, I remember doing an interview. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1489.2s)]
*  I think it was one of the first debates [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1491.32s)]
*  that Bernie and Hillary had in Florida, I think it was. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1494.08s)]
*  And an MSNBC anchor said, aren't you [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1500.08s)]
*  afraid of the Clintons and what they'll do? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1503.56s)]
*  And I said, no, I'm not afraid. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1507.2s)]
*  But I thought it was quite curious [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1509.92s)]
*  that he felt compelled to ask that question [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1511.44s)]
*  with concern in his voice. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1514.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, people who've been around them knew. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1517.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1519.08s)]
*  So you still, though, were in the party [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1519.72s)]
*  when did it become clear, like, I can't represent this party [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1523.56s)]
*  anymore? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1526.56s)]
*  It was in the fall of 2022. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1527.32s)]
*  There were a lot of critical midterm elections [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1532.24s)]
*  happening that year, increasingly over time. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1537.04s)]
*  And it wasn't one specific thing that caused [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1541.0s)]
*  me to make this decision. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1543.6s)]
*  But it was increasingly over time. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1544.84s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1547.76s)]
*  Obviously, the radical change that the Democratic Party [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1548.6799999999998s)]
*  leadership went through in really, truly become [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1551.68s)]
*  a woke, warmongering party of the elite. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1555.76s)]
*  But also, it was a recognition that I [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1560.0s)]
*  had done all I could to try to change the party from within. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1565.68s)]
*  I tried as vice chair of the DNC. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1572.4s)]
*  I tried as a candidate running for president in 2020 [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1575.28s)]
*  in the Democratic primary. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1578.24s)]
*  And the things that I was talking about, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1580.44s)]
*  about bringing the party back to its roots, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1583.3200000000002s)]
*  bringing the party back to being the party of the people [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1584.96s)]
*  and the party of freedom, the party of peace and security, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1587.28s)]
*  it not only fell on deaf ears. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1592.64s)]
*  I was booed by the party elite for having the audacity [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1594.64s)]
*  to push for these sorts of things. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1600.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is a very restrained version of what I saw. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1603.1200000000001s)]
*  They didn't just boo you. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1605.96s)]
*  They accused you of being an agent for foreign power [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1607.88s)]
*  and a disloyal American and an evil person. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1611.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1613.68s)]
*  I mean, I saw that. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1614.44s)]
*  It's true. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1616.5200000000002s)]
*  And it's such a crazy, crazy accusation to make. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1617.16s)]
*  Obviously, completely baseless. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1624.0400000000002s)]
*  The media never asked Hillary Clinton [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1626.0400000000002s)]
*  for evidence of this traitorous, treasonous act [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1627.88s)]
*  that she's accusing me of. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1631.6000000000001s)]
*  As a sitting member of Congress and as a soldier [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1632.96s)]
*  wearing our country's uniform. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1635.36s)]
*  Yeah, an officer, right? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1638.6799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1639.84s)]
*  And here's the problem is, is that it works. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1640.36s)]
*  And that's why they continue, even now. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1646.4399999999998s)]
*  How many years later? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1648.32s)]
*  They continue to fall back on the Russia, Russia playbook. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1649.28s)]
*  It's a Russian asset. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1653.0s)]
*  They've used this against you. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1654.08s)]
*  They've used this against Donald Trump. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1655.36s)]
*  And they continue to come back to this. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1656.9599999999998s)]
*  But I'm not an officer in the United States Army. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1658.84s)]
*  And you are. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1660.8s)]
*  So it's a little weird to say, I mean, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1661.32s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, I will never forget it, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1664.04s)]
*  accused you of being a disloyal person. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1667.24s)]
*  That's a crime under the military code, I think. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1671.32s)]
*  It is. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1673.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1674.3999999999999s)]
*  It is. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1674.96s)]
*  And one that would not only be grounds for them [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1675.52s)]
*  to remove my security clearance, but it [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1677.92s)]
*  would be grounds for discharge. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1680.72s)]
*  And it would be grounds for enforcement [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1683.08s)]
*  under the uniform code of military justice. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1687.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1689.6399999999999s)]
*  If you're actually working for a foreign power [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1690.1599999999999s)]
*  as a military officer, you can be executed for it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1691.96s)]
*  It's not a small thing to say. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1694.08s)]
*  So rather than just saying, Tulsi Gabbard's an idiot, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1696.28s)]
*  or I disagree with her, or whatever, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1699.32s)]
*  they went right to that, the heaviest thing you could ever [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1700.84s)]
*  say about somebody, about an American. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1703.8s)]
*  That was all foreign policy related, right? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1707.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1709.24s)]
*  That's the way it felt to me. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1709.74s)]
*  It was foreign policy related. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1711.8s)]
*  And it was related to the fact that I had the audacity [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1714.24s)]
*  to go against them, to challenge the elite [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1721.0s)]
*  of the Democratic Party, which is Hillary Clinton, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1724.84s)]
*  and it's Barack Obama, and it's the people who surround them [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1726.88s)]
*  in the military industrial complex, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1732.4s)]
*  in the media industrial complex, those who are pushing. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1734.32s)]
*  And it's not limited to the Democratic Party, of course. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1738.88s)]
*  Mitt Romney also called me a treasonous person who [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1741.64s)]
*  is a Russian asset, or something along those lines. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1746.16s)]
*  So they are all part of this permanent Washington elite [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1748.88s)]
*  who cannot allow for those who challenge them to go unscathed, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1756.6000000000001s)]
*  because their whole existence is based around that. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1765.16s)]
*  It's based around power and where [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1772.64s)]
*  they get their power from. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1774.24s)]
*  And the main source of power, obviously, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1775.92s)]
*  is the exercise of military force. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1777.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1779.08s)]
*  It's the most powerful thing. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1781.24s)]
*  We are the most powerful military in the world. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1783.08s)]
*  And that's what's so offensive about them [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1785.8799999999999s)]
*  and what they're advocating for is they treat our military. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1788.8799999999999s)]
*  And actually, I don't want to say [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1798.7199999999998s)]
*  they forget, because they're not stupid. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1800.04s)]
*  They really don't care about the men and women who [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1803.48s)]
*  make up our military and who live and die [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1806.4s)]
*  by the consequences of their actions, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1810.8400000000001s)]
*  whether they're holding office or not. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1815.4s)]
*  Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are not in office right now, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1817.92s)]
*  but they still continue to wield immense power [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1820.48s)]
*  in influencing the decisions that are being made. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1823.76s)]
*  So can I just sort of sidebar, but I [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1825.8000000000002s)]
*  think relevant, interesting. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1827.8400000000001s)]
*  Are you answering the question that everyone watching has, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1830.1200000000001s)]
*  which is who is running the government at this point? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1832.52s)]
*  It's obviously not Joe Biden. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1834.5600000000002s)]
*  You think Hillary Clinton? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1836.0s)]
*  It's not a leap of imagination to know that that's true when [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1837.96s)]
*  you look at the people who are in Joe Biden's administration. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1842.2s)]
*  They are the people who were the right hands for the Obama [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1845.64s)]
*  administration, for President Obama, and for Hillary Clinton. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1850.72s)]
*  When Hillary Clinton said herself the other day, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1855.08s)]
*  she said, oh, yeah, I talk to the White House every day. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1857.24s)]
*  So it is no shock or surprise who [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1859.76s)]
*  the influences are behind the policies that are coming out [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1863.12s)]
*  of this White House that many people say [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1868.04s)]
*  is the most radical and woke White House that our country [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1871.0s)]
*  has ever seen. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1875.56s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1876.84s)]
*  But as this was happening to you, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1879.7199999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you didn't want to go to the White House [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1882.36s)]
*  Correspondents' Dinner. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1884.6s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1885.52s)]
*  Tiresome. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1886.4799999999998s)]
*  But on the other hand, it is a lot easier and much more [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1887.6399999999999s)]
*  pleasant to be loved than it is to be hated. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1891.16s)]
*  I think it's just true. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1894.68s)]
*  And so as you became really hated [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1896.8000000000002s)]
*  by the leadership of the Democratic Party, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1899.8000000000002s)]
*  and they weren't hiding it at all, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1901.64s)]
*  did you ever think maybe it's just [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1903.76s)]
*  easier to kind of pretend bombing Syria is a good idea? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1905.6000000000001s)]
*  Did you ever question your decision to say no? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1909.5600000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1912.8400000000001s)]
*  I knew that that would be true. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1913.88s)]
*  I knew that there was certainly an easier path to take. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1916.92s)]
*  You think? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1920.24s)]
*  It was kind of laid out for me when I first got there. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1921.92s)]
*  But I never second guessed my decisions [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1925.68s)]
*  about these different positions that I took. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1930.76s)]
*  I never regretted them. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1934.24s)]
*  Never, not to this day. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1937.44s)]
*  And I never will, because I didn't [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1939.28s)]
*  go to Washington to be loved by the people who live and exist [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1941.68s)]
*  and thrive in that bubble. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1946.84s)]
*  Well, sure, I get it. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1948.52s)]
*  Their love is not worth having. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1950.24s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1951.68s)]
*  But their money's good. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1952.68s)]
*  And I think you're the only famous person I've ever [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1954.68s)]
*  met who flies coach. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1956.84s)]
*  And you're certainly the only very, very well-known member [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1958.24s)]
*  of Congress and former presidential candidate [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1961.72s)]
*  I've ever met in my entire life who didn't cash in personally. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1964.24s)]
*  And I know that is factually true. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1967.24s)]
*  So do you ever think maybe, I don't know, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1970.48s)]
*  it's easier to fly first class? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1974.68s)]
*  Maybe I should have just. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1976.0s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1976.92s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1979.2s)]
*  Do you think it's weird that we never talk [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1980.3600000000001s)]
*  about the money involved? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1982.04s)]
*  I just know that from living there [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1983.64s)]
*  and from knowing a lot of well-known people who've [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1985.8s)]
*  become famous in politics. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1988.44s)]
*  And there's not one of them, not one, literally not one. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1990.48s)]
*  On either side, he's not in the top 1% for income. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1993.72s)]
*  But you're not. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1996.8400000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1997.88s)]
*  Why doesn't anyone ever say that? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=1998.4s)]
*  Because it is the assumed norm. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2000.32s)]
*  It's not the exception. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2004.3600000000001s)]
*  What they're doing is the norm. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2005.44s)]
*  So why would they talk about it? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2007.4s)]
*  There's nothing to talk about because they assume [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2009.12s)]
*  that every member of Congress, whether they're [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2011.0s)]

*  you get your payday. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2016.12s)]
*  What did you get when you walked out? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2017.32s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2019.56s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2021.9199999999998s)]
*  I had to come up with a plan of, all right, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2022.4399999999998s)]
*  we've got to figure out how we're going to pay the bills. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2025.8s)]
*  How much money had you amassed during your time in Congress? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2028.1999999999998s)]
*  Every financial advisor would probably be very disappointed. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2032.56s)]
*  Because my husband and I were like, OK, we [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2038.28s)]
*  got a couple of months. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2042.44s)]
*  We got a couple of months that we can make it through. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2043.56s)]
*  We've got to come up with a plan otherwise. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2045.76s)]
*  Before you'd have to sell your weekend house? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2048.96s)]
*  Sure. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2052.12s)]
*  The imaginary weekend house. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2053.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2056.64s)]
*  Were you able to buy a big house when you were in Congress? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2057.32s)]
*  No. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2060.24s)]
*  No. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2061.0s)]
*  No. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2062.0s)]
*  We bought a house. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2063.84s)]
*  I don't think you ever came to our house there. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2066.28s)]
*  But here's, I'll give you a little hint, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2068.4s)]
*  and we shared it with my sister and her husband. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2072.2400000000002s)]
*  But we did buy a house in a neighborhood [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2075.36s)]
*  that was affordable in DC. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2077.6000000000004s)]
*  And we found out the first week that we were there [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2079.8s)]
*  that we tried to order takeout from someone. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2082.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, in DC? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2085.88s)]
*  Oh, you lived in the hood. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2086.5600000000004s)]
*  I knew that. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2087.44s)]
*  In DC. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2087.96s)]
*  And as soon as they were like, OK, put the order in [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2088.7200000000003s)]
*  and everything else. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2090.92s)]
*  And as soon as I gave them the address, they were like, oh, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2092.32s)]
*  no. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2095.48s)]
*  We don't deliver to that neighborhood. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2095.96s)]
*  We won't cross that bridge. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2098.04s)]
*  We won't cross the Anacostia Bridge to get to your house. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2099.32s)]
*  You lived on what we call the other side of the river. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2103.04s)]
*  Literally. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2105.56s)]
*  Anyway, there was a question that a reporter asked me [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2108.64s)]
*  a couple of years, I think two or three years [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2113.68s)]
*  after I'd been in Congress. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2115.88s)]
*  They're like, OK, you've been here a while now. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2117.0s)]
*  Do you feel like you fit in? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2121.44s)]
*  And it was a surprising question to me. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2124.32s)]
*  And I said, no. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2126.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't ever want to fit in here. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2128.28s)]
*  This is not my home. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2130.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm grateful to get out of here as quickly as possible, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2133.7200000000003s)]
*  as soon as votes are done, as often as possible, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2136.6400000000003s)]
*  get back to my community in Hawaii, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2139.32s)]
*  or get out and visit other communities in the country, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2141.0400000000004s)]
*  and remain very closely connected to the people who [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2144.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm there to serve. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2151.6800000000003s)]
*  We've talked about this before. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2154.28s)]
*  There are far too many politicians [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2157.48s)]
*  from both parties who spend their time at social hours [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2159.36s)]
*  and happy hours with lobbyists than they do actually [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2164.76s)]
*  spend time at home. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2169.44s)]
*  Does anyone ever, oh, that's certainly true. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2170.92s)]
*  And they have sad, sad personal lives, almost, not all, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2173.6s)]
*  but most, as you know. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2176.96s)]
*  But I'm always amazed by the financial disclosures. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2178.96s)]
*  And again, since this is the last question, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2183.44s)]
*  but since no one else talks about it, I will. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2185.16s)]
*  And you see these members of Congress who are, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2187.48s)]
*  some cases they're clever, maybe even smart. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2189.68s)]
*  Some cases are just pretty ordinary, actually. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2192.48s)]
*  And they're so rich relative to the mean. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2195.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2198.36s)]
*  And I have no idea how they made all that money. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2199.6s)]
*  I have no clue at all how Nancy Pelosi is just so rich, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2201.52s)]
*  or how her stock picks are way better than Warren Buffett's. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2205.48s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2208.76s)]
*  But does anyone ever talk about that internally, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2210.1600000000003s)]
*  like on the Hill? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2213.84s)]
*  No, because most of them benefit from it. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2214.7200000000003s)]
*  I love these accounts on X and on Instagram [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2218.6000000000004s)]
*  that pop up now that are actually tracking. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2222.48s)]
*  And I don't know how they do it. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2224.96s)]
*  I really don't know how they figure it out. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2226.0s)]
*  But they are tracking what she's buying [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2228.48s)]
*  and what other members of Congress are buying. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2231.2000000000003s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi's stock tracker? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2232.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2234.28s)]
*  That's definitely one of them. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2235.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2236.6000000000004s)]
*  But they're like, hey, everybody pay it. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2237.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2238.24s)]
*  It's incredible to see. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2238.72s)]
*  And when you watch that, and I'm so glad for the transparency [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2241.12s)]
*  that they're providing the people in real time almost. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2244.56s)]
*  But it's no wonder why she and others, Democrats [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2248.16s)]
*  and Republicans, who could very easily pass the legislation [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2253.3999999999996s)]
*  that says no member of Congress or the Senate, or their spouse, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2257.08s)]
*  or their senior staff should be allowed to trade in stocks. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2261.8399999999997s)]
*  Period. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2265.4399999999996s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2266.2799999999997s)]
*  It's such an obvious way to stop even the perception, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2268.0s)]
*  if you want to claim innocence or whatever. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2271.48s)]
*  There should be no perception that our elected leaders are [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2274.2400000000002s)]
*  profiting off of the knowledge that they have as policymakers [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2277.6400000000003s)]
*  that directly impact industry and businesses. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2281.92s)]
*  That's a no brainer to me. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2284.32s)]
*  I introduced legislation when I was in Congress to do that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2285.5200000000004s)]
*  Many people have since then. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2288.0800000000004s)]
*  There's been a lot of talk and conversation. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2289.6400000000003s)]
*  Why hasn't it gone anywhere? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2291.84s)]
*  That's why. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2293.6000000000004s)]
*  Because they profit off it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2294.28s)]
*  Of course they don't want to talk about it. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2296.08s)]
*  That's just an easy one. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2298.72s)]
*  It is. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2299.92s)]
*  And frankly, why do they need to be forced? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2300.48s)]
*  I'm not some kind of stock trader, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  but when I was like 23 and 24, I had $5,000 in my savings [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2307.44s)]
*  accounts. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2312.48s)]
*  I was like, OK, cool. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2312.96s)]
*  Let me learn a little bit about stocks. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2313.72s)]
*  I put some money in some stocks, and I [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2314.88s)]
*  don't remember how they did. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2317.56s)]
*  But I knew immediately, going into Congress, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2318.7999999999997s)]
*  perception is reality. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2323.72s)]
*  And so it doesn't matter, like, well, I've [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2325.56s)]
*  had this stock for 15 years, or whatever. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2327.28s)]
*  It doesn't even matter what it is. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2329.16s)]
*  I got rid of, I did not participate [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2330.52s)]
*  in anything related to stocks or stock trading [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2334.72s)]
*  or buying or selling or anything for the entire time [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2338.0s)]
*  that I was in Congress. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2340.6s)]
*  And it's not some like, oh, look at me. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2341.56s)]
*  I'm so great. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2343.6s)]
*  It's just common sense that we have people [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2344.28s)]
*  in great positions of power. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2347.44s)]
*  Why should they be forced to do something [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2348.8s)]
*  with the passage of a law? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2350.72s)]
*  Why don't they just do the right thing and say, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2351.64s)]
*  we get that even an innocent thing could [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2354.2799999999997s)]
*  be perceived as insider trading. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2357.64s)]
*  We're just not going to go there. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2359.24s)]
*  Because it's too lucrative to give up. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2362.2799999999997s)]
*  And they know they can get away with it. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2365.2799999999997s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2367.08s)]
*  So you have explained, and thank you, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2368.68s)]
*  the history of Hawaii, which I think [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2371.56s)]
*  is directly relevant to the choices that you've made. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2372.96s)]
*  And as far as I know, everything is just true. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2375.44s)]
*  And so the party has changed a lot in just the brief time [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2380.24s)]
*  that you remember of it, a lot, dramatically, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2384.96s)]
*  unrecognizable. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2388.0s)]
*  But also in the process of going through all these experiences [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2389.44s)]
*  and being attacked by people who said they were your allies, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2392.68s)]
*  you've got to change. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2396.64s)]
*  I've changed dramatically in 20 years, just through, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2398.56s)]
*  we all do, if we're honest. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2401.04s)]
*  So how have you changed? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2403.56s)]
*  Like, what perceptions of yours are different from what [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2404.72s)]
*  they were five years ago? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2407.0s)]
*  It is that the last five years that it became more and more [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2410.52s)]
*  clear to me how many people, especially [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2416.96s)]
*  the Democratic Party in Washington, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2421.2000000000003s)]
*  specifically, how little they think of the Constitution. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2423.92s)]
*  And I think the last five years especially [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2429.6800000000003s)]
*  are pretty pivotal because you look [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2433.1600000000003s)]
*  at what happened with COVID, for example, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2434.8s)]
*  as a starting point of how people, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2438.04s)]
*  both at the federal level, at the state level, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2440.08s)]
*  county level, and a lot of places, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2441.96s)]
*  when given just a little bit of power, man, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2443.36s)]
*  they took advantage of that and continued [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2446.44s)]
*  to abuse that power in a way that just didn't make sense. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2450.08s)]
*  It didn't make sense. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2453.8s)]
*  When they're like, OK, well, for public safety, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2455.4s)]
*  everybody's got to stay indoors, and you can't go to church, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2457.88s)]
*  and you can't even worship. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2460.52s)]
*  In Hawaii, on the beach, you can't [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2463.08s)]
*  have an outdoor service. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2465.32s)]
*  But if you're going to go and do a Black Lives Matter march, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2468.0400000000004s)]
*  that actually rises above any public health and safety [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2472.48s)]
*  concerns that we talked about. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2476.28s)]
*  And so that's OK. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2477.5600000000004s)]
*  The politically motivated decisions [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2479.2400000000002s)]
*  that were being made in the midst of what they were calling [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2482.2400000000002s)]
*  this the greatest health epidemic of our time, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2484.6800000000003s)]
*  I think exposed pretty deeply to a lot of people [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2487.84s)]
*  that it was really all just about power [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2492.1600000000003s)]
*  and how little they were concerned about things [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2494.24s)]
*  like freedom and civil liberties and the ability for us [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2497.04s)]
*  to make our own choices for ourselves. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2499.8399999999997s)]
*  And then it just continued to escalate more and more [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2502.08s)]
*  with the Biden-Harris administration [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2505.7599999999998s)]
*  in how they were undermining the rule of law, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2508.9199999999996s)]
*  continuing to this day, and how willing they [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2512.6s)]
*  were to both directly and indirectly censor, blacklist, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2516.6s)]
*  and smear everyday Americans across the country [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2521.64s)]
*  if you happen to challenge them, whether it be on COVID [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2526.7599999999998s)]
*  or it be on things like it. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2529.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think this was the thing that [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2532.04s)]
*  caused Mitt Romney to call me a treasonous liar, was saying, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2535.04s)]
*  hey, there are US-funded, DOD-funded biolabs in Ukraine [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2539.92s)]
*  that should be secured because there's [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2547.3199999999997s)]
*  a war going on over there. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2549.64s)]
*  And the last thing we or the world needs [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2551.12s)]
*  is anything going on in those biolabs [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2554.6s)]
*  being unleashed in a way that could pose a threat to people. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2558.3199999999997s)]
*  That was seen as a- [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2564.68s)]
*  But I should just say, you weren't guessing. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2566.72s)]
*  No. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2568.7599999999998s)]
*  You got that. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2569.3599999999997s)]
*  It was confirmed in any case in a public exchange [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2570.3599999999997s)]
*  in the Senate between Marco Rubio of Florida, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2573.7599999999998s)]
*  the sitting Republican senator, and Victoria [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2576.2s)]
*  Newell and the undersecretary of state [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2579.08s)]
*  who volunteered it on camera. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2580.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2582.84s)]
*  And it was on the DOD website talking [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2584.04s)]
*  about their long history of funding these biolabs, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2589.0s)]
*  not only in Ukraine, but in many other countries [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2593.24s)]
*  around the world. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2596.0s)]
*  Because it's outside US law. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2597.0s)]
*  And it's bioweapons research, obviously. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2599.72s)]
*  But you were just, I don't even think you said that. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2602.12s)]
*  You just said basically what the undersecretary of state [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2605.56s)]
*  said in the Senate. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2609.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2610.4s)]
*  And then you have a creature like Mitt Romney calling you [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2610.92s)]
*  a traitor to your country. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2616.56s)]
*  So what do you think of him? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2619.24s)]
*  What is that? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2621.6s)]
*  Why would he be so committed to a lie [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2622.4s)]
*  that he'd be willing to try to destroy your character? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2624.84s)]
*  He is part of that neocon, neolib establishment [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2629.6s)]
*  in Washington that poses a direct threat to our republic, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2634.48s)]
*  to our democracy, and to our freedom. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2639.52s)]
*  And that really is at the heart of why I chose [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2642.92s)]
*  to leave the Democratic Party. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2646.96s)]
*  Seeing people, and yep, got it, he's a Republican. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2649.32s)]
*  But he took the same position as Hillary Clinton [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2653.4s)]
*  and many other Democrats who don't care about our country. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2657.08s)]
*  That's what it comes down to. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2661.4s)]
*  They don't care about our country. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2663.04s)]
*  I challenged Mitt Romney. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2664.4s)]
*  I sent him a legal letter challenging him [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2665.36s)]
*  on his accusation for the very reason that we talked about. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2667.92s)]
*  As a uniformed officer serving in the United States Army, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2671.6s)]
*  his accusation as a US senator is a crime punishable by death. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2675.52s)]
*  So if you're going to make that accusation as he did [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2683.52s)]
*  on what was then known as Twitter, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2685.52s)]
*  you better freaking back it up. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2688.04s)]
*  If you take three steps back, it's like obviously [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2690.92s)]
*  Mitt Romney is emotionally a child. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2692.92s)]
*  He's very much a subgenius. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2695.2000000000003s)]
*  He's not a genius, I'll just put it that way. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2697.2400000000002s)]
*  And he's made hundreds of millions [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2700.6800000000003s)]
*  of dollars in our economy. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2702.28s)]
*  What does that tell you about our economy? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2705.16s)]
*  How could a guy like that get so unbelievably rich? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2706.96s)]
*  There's something systemically wrong, right? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2710.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a whole, I think there's a huge, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2714.44s)]
*  and I think this will be the topic of the next book [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2718.12s)]
*  that I'll write is as we talk about the military industrial [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2721.64s)]
*  complex, there is a corporate industrial complex [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2725.04s)]
*  that exists as well. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2728.2s)]
*  I'm all about capitalism. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2729.56s)]
*  But when you look at the monopolies of the fear, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2731.36s)]
*  that's not capitalism at all. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2734.4s)]
*  You look at how many small businesses [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2736.48s)]
*  are suffering in this country because of overregulation [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2738.2s)]
*  by government and because they can't afford to pay millions, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2740.7599999999998s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars to have lobbyists going [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2744.52s)]
*  and scratching the back of politicians [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2747.0s)]
*  so that they can create the loopholes that [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  allow their business to thrive at the cost of the mass [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2750.64s)]
*  majority of the small businesses in our country [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2754.8399999999997s)]
*  and the elimination of competitiveness, true competition, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2757.72s)]
*  which capitalism's all about, true competition [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2761.7599999999998s)]
*  in our country. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2764.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's how, when you look at people like Mitt Romney [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2765.6s)]
*  and you see how they have done so well, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2768.12s)]
*  that's the reason why. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2770.48s)]
*  He's just so disgraceful. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2772.12s)]
*  It's hard to believe he's real, but he is. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2774.52s)]
*  So how did he respond when you said- [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2777.04s)]
*  He didn't. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2778.64s)]
*  His silence was- [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2779.76s)]
*  He didn't respond at all? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2781.2400000000002s)]
*  He did not respond at all. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2782.2000000000003s)]
*  Not to my lawyer and not on Twitter [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2784.28s)]
*  and not in any way, shape, or form, which it didn't surprise me. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2787.1200000000003s)]
*  It's so dishonorable. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2794.2400000000002s)]
*  It is. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2795.88s)]
*  It is. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2796.6000000000004s)]
*  It is. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2797.6800000000003s)]
*  I am so grateful and really, truly feel [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2798.2000000000003s)]
*  like it is a privilege to be able to serve [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2803.92s)]
*  our country in uniform. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2806.5200000000004s)]
*  April makes 21 years for me. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2808.84s)]
*  I'm grateful to serve as a battalion commander currently [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2812.0800000000004s)]
*  where I have the opportunity to work [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2814.96s)]
*  with incredible Americans who come from all over the country [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2817.0800000000004s)]
*  and who deeply love our country. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2821.6000000000004s)]
*  It's not a small sacrifice to make, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2824.6400000000003s)]
*  both for those who are serving as active duty service [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2827.6400000000003s)]
*  members as well as those who serve in the reserve component. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2830.4s)]
*  There's a reason why we do it, and it [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2833.48s)]
*  stems from a deep love for our country. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2835.1600000000003s)]
*  And to have a guy like that make such an accusation, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2838.44s)]
*  yeah, it hits close to home, not only for me, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2844.6s)]
*  but the real issue with that and why I challenged him on it [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2848.64s)]
*  is because when people like Mitt Romney [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2852.4s)]
*  make that kind of accusation, people like Hillary Clinton [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2856.2000000000003s)]
*  call me a traitor and a Russian asset or a puppet of Putin, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2859.7200000000003s)]
*  this is not about me. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2867.08s)]
*  It's about the message that they're [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2868.7599999999998s)]
*  sending to every serviceman and woman in this country [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2870.3199999999997s)]
*  and every American, that if you dare to challenge us, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2874.24s)]
*  we will come at you with all we have. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2878.68s)]
*  It's always the least American people [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2880.52s)]
*  who make the claim that you're not American enough. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2882.08s)]
*  But do you ever think, so again, this [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2887.16s)]
*  is demonstrable if anyone who's made it to this point [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2890.16s)]
*  and in the conversation can decide, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2892.52s)]
*  do I agree or disagree with it, Tulsi Goward? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2895.16s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2896.92s)]
*  But I don't think any fair person could [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2898.3999999999996s)]
*  say you're in this for the money or the accolades. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2900.2s)]
*  Just the opposite. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2903.3199999999997s)]
*  You're continuing to get deployed, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2904.8399999999997s)]
*  and you're not making any money doing that. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2907.8799999999997s)]
*  You're doing it anyway. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2910.48s)]
*  It's quite a time commitment. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2911.3999999999996s)]
*  Do you ever think maybe politics is not the business for me [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2913.8399999999997s)]
*  because I believe what I believe and I'm kind of never [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2917.12s)]
*  going to sell it out? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2921.8399999999997s)]
*  Maybe you're not transactional enough for that. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2924.64s)]
*  No, I'm serious. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2927.3199999999997s)]
*  I have never thought of quote unquote politics [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2931.12s)]
*  as a career at all, ever. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2934.8799999999997s)]
*  And so the different times in my life [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2938.2s)]
*  where I have held public office, it's never been, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2940.64s)]
*  well, this is what I'm going to do for the next few decades, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2943.56s)]
*  and then I'll retire. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2946.6s)]
*  And it's why I have left at different times. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2948.64s)]
*  I did not run for reelection when [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2953.12s)]
*  I was serving in the state house because I [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2955.12s)]
*  decided to volunteer and deploy to Iraq [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2956.8399999999997s)]
*  with my brothers and sisters in the Hawaii National [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2958.68s)]
*  Guard at the time. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2960.92s)]
*  I did not run for Congress again and reelection in 2020 [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2962.3599999999997s)]
*  because I felt like I could, the climate [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2967.64s)]
*  of the House of Representatives had gotten to that point [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2972.64s)]
*  where I felt like I had maximized the impact [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2976.0s)]
*  that I could make there. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2978.0s)]
*  And I could be of more influence at that time [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2979.04s)]
*  on the outside, kind of holding their feet to the fire [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2983.52s)]
*  and being able to share exactly what I am now [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2987.08s)]
*  with the American people, the truth about what's [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2989.36s)]
*  going on in Washington and the truth about these politicians [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2991.32s)]
*  who claim to care for you but show through their actions [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2993.92s)]
*  that they don't more and more brazenly. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=2997.32s)]
*  And this is really, you'd ask the question [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3000.44s)]
*  about what happened over the last five years and the change [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3002.92s)]
*  really, where there has been a change, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3009.5600000000004s)]
*  it has come from a much deeper appreciation, frankly, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3013.4s)]
*  of our Constitution and the role that our leaders must [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3021.0800000000004s)]
*  have in truly upholding the Constitution. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3026.2000000000003s)]
*  It's obviously something I've sworn oath to twice in my life [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3029.6000000000004s)]
*  and I care very deeply for. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3032.7200000000003s)]
*  To see how those in power were so brazenly and continue [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3035.6s)]
*  to so brazenly abuse their power and weaponize [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3040.56s)]
*  our law enforcement, the national security state, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3047.24s)]
*  all of these different tools that are at their disposal, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3049.56s)]
*  increasingly pushing us towards a place where our country is [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3053.7999999999997s)]
*  being led by a tyrannical government. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3059.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3062.08s)]
*  The problem of the country. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3062.92s)]
*  It's a very real danger. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3064.96s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3067.2s)]
*  But I frankly couldn't, 10 years ago, maybe even less [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3067.7200000000003s)]
*  than that, I don't think I would have said that. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3074.88s)]
*  Oh, I don't think most people would have said it at all [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3079.88s)]
*  because it seemed like just the normal disagreements [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3082.48s)]
*  between people with the same goal, which [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3085.56s)]
*  is to help the country. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3087.32s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3088.2400000000002s)]
*  Obviously, the problem of the Constitution, though, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3089.64s)]
*  is that the whole document basically [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3091.84s)]
*  is just limits on the power and authority of politicians. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3094.16s)]
*  That's the whole purpose of it. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3097.12s)]
*  Here's what you can't do to the population. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3098.3599999999997s)]
*  But it's in the hands of politicians to uphold. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3101.48s)]
*  So maybe that's the core problem with our government, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3105.48s)]
*  our system of government, is they [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3111.08s)]
*  have to restrain their own power. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3113.72s)]
*  What if they're like, well, we don't care about the Constitution? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3115.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, white guys wrote it and they were racist [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3117.92s)]
*  and it's now invalid. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3119.68s)]
*  And that's exactly where the leaders of today's Democratic [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3121.2799999999997s)]
*  Party are. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3124.6s)]
*  That is their mindset. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3125.3999999999996s)]
*  But what do you do about that? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3126.3999999999996s)]
*  That's where going and actually looking again [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3127.8799999999997s)]
*  at our founding documents, looking [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3131.7599999999998s)]
*  at the Declaration of Independence, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3133.52s)]
*  looking at the Federalist Papers, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3134.8799999999997s)]
*  where we are reminded over and over and over again [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3137.8799999999997s)]
*  about how our nation's founders continue to say it's [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3140.7999999999997s)]
*  we the people, that our government does not exist [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3144.9199999999996s)]
*  without the consent of the governed. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3147.3599999999997s)]
*  And this is the message I'm carrying [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3150.08s)]
*  everywhere across the country, is [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3151.52s)]
*  that if you are not happy with the direction [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3153.12s)]
*  that our country is headed, and I [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3155.16s)]
*  think that most people are not happy with it, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3158.32s)]
*  this changes only when we take action, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3162.04s)]
*  only when we take action. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3165.92s)]
*  There's no knight in shining armor [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3167.08s)]
*  that's coming to save the country. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3168.56s)]
*  Our founders specifically built our country [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3170.64s)]
*  on the foundation of we the people taking ownership [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3174.0s)]
*  and responsibility for the kind of leadership [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3178.0s)]
*  that we want and the kind of future that we want. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3179.92s)]
*  And right now, I am sounding the alarm [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3183.04s)]
*  and encouraging everyone to sound the alarm. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3186.52s)]
*  The name of my book is For Love of Country, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3188.44s)]
*  Leave the Democrat Party Behind, specifically and very directly [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3190.76s)]
*  pointing to those who pose the greatest threat [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3195.36s)]
*  to our democracy, to our freedom, to our security, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3198.7200000000003s)]
*  and our ability to live in peace right now. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3202.6s)]
*  And my concern, my grave concern is [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3206.2400000000002s)]
*  that in this next election, if President Biden or Harris [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3208.88s)]
*  or whoever they may put up, if it's not President Biden, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3213.2400000000002s)]
*  if they are allowed to remain in power, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3216.6800000000003s)]
*  then we will get to a place where the country that I love, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3219.2000000000003s)]
*  that you love, that so many of us love and appreciate [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3224.44s)]
*  will become unrecognizable and to a place [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3226.84s)]
*  where the freedoms that we are already starting to lose, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3233.12s)]
*  that we won't be able to get them back. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3237.64s)]
*  I know a lot of people have been to jail [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3242.08s)]
*  in the last three and a half years, like a lot. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3244.84s)]
*  And I've interviewed a lot, just interviewed one today. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3247.48s)]
*  And they've gone to jail for their political views [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3251.0s)]
*  and for their willingness to challenge the people in power. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3253.92s)]
*  If Biden or if Clinton Obama get reelected [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3257.12s)]
*  using Biden as a cutout and Kamala Harris, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3262.28s)]
*  are you worried that, I mean, we're talking about [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3265.28s)]
*  like actual Americans, American citizens going to jail, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3269.0400000000004s)]
*  we're gonna see a lot more of that, it feels like to me. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3272.28s)]
*  We are already seeing more of that. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3275.4s)]
*  And I have no doubt that that will only escalate [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3278.7200000000003s)]
*  dramatically because every time, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3282.5600000000004s)]
*  they could win the election by theoretically one vote, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3286.32s)]
*  and they will run around the country and say, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3290.0s)]
*  well, the American people have given us a mandate [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3291.92s)]
*  to continue the great work we are doing for this country. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3295.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, the great work that they see they're doing [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3297.88s)]
*  for this country is actually for themselves. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3299.84s)]
*  And they are completely undermining the fabric [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3302.6800000000003s)]
*  that makes this country what it is. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3308.12s)]
*  That's for sure, but are you worried? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3310.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, you're in this interesting position because [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3311.6800000000003s)]
*  they've always, they've disliked Trump for a long time, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3315.48s)]
*  disliked me for a long time. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3318.7200000000003s)]
*  They thought they could use you, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3320.8s)]
*  they thought they loved you, and so they hate you [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3322.96s)]
*  with a very intense and very specific kind of hate. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3325.8s)]
*  And you've given them the finger at every turn, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3330.2400000000002s)]
*  like, and you won't stop. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3332.32s)]
*  So like, do you ever think to yourself? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3333.96s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3336.36s)]
*  Why wouldn't they indict you for being a Russian agent [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3338.32s)]
*  or whatever? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3340.7200000000003s)]
*  As we are seeing now, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3343.0800000000004s)]
*  they are completely willing to use the Department of Justice [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3346.48s)]
*  and law enforcement to serve their own political means. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3350.16s)]
*  So no, it wouldn't surprise me at all. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3355.64s)]
*  They are showing that even without evidence, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3359.68s)]
*  without basis, without anything to back up their claims, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3362.8799999999997s)]
*  they are, you know, and this is what they've been doing, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3367.2s)]
*  this against Trump since he first ran for office in 2016, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3370.64s)]
*  launching years long investigations into him, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3374.52s)]
*  this whole Russia collusion thing, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3377.6s)]
*  things that were, you know, proven through those investigations, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3379.04s)]
*  like, no, there was nothing here. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3382.68s)]
*  And there's been no accountability for them whatsoever, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3385.2799999999997s)]
*  which goes back to just emphasizing how critical it is. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3388.2799999999997s)]
*  If you are a person who cares about freedom, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3395.2799999999997s)]
*  who cares about our country, who cares about, you know, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3398.7599999999998s)]
*  being able to make your own decisions as parents [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3401.6s)]
*  about what kind of education you want for your child, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3404.2799999999997s)]
*  if you care about having a safe community for your child to live in, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3406.96s)]
*  if you care about having a secure country with borders, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3410.16s)]
*  the Democratic Party is not the answer. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3416.76s)]
*  It is not the answer. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3422.44s)]
*  They are, in fact, the problem. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3423.8s)]
*  So you've been in a lot of different news stories [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3427.48s)]
*  about what you talked about as a potential VP choice for Trump. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3432.08s)]
*  I have no idea if that's going to happen or not. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3438.52s)]
*  Probably unknowable. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3440.52s)]
*  Are you open to that? If you don't do that, what else are you open to? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3442.2000000000003s)]
*  What's your plan? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3445.8s)]
*  I would be honored. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3449.28s)]
*  I'd be honored to serve our country in that way or in other ways [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3450.76s)]
*  and to be in a position to help President Trump. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3456.6800000000003s)]
*  If he is reelected to actually address these challenges, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3460.52s)]
*  to help execute those policies that will bring back a secure border, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3464.72s)]
*  that will breathe new life into our economy [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3469.2s)]
*  and start to get this radical inflation out of control. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3473.6s)]
*  Which on that note, I was in a conversation the other day [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3477.0s)]
*  with like two different groups of people. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3481.68s)]
*  One was with a very, very wealthy couple, and they were saying, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3484.28s)]
*  well, gosh, you know, and they're not fans of President Biden either. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3488.8s)]
*  They're like, you know, the economy is not actually that bad. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3491.6800000000003s)]
*  The stock market's doing all right. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3493.8s)]
*  And, you know, it's not really as bad as a lot of people are saying it is. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3495.04s)]
*  And then the next conversation was with people who are not part of that [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3500.0800000000004s)]
*  that wealthy class who were talking about, you know, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3505.32s)]
*  a loaf of bread is three times more expensive today than it was six months ago [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3510.0s)]
*  or a year ago. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3514.36s)]
*  Basic necessities, electricity, food, medicine, all of the things that [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3515.56s)]
*  that people need just to live and and to try to live in a healthy way [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3520.44s)]
*  are far more expensive, but they're not making a whole lot more. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3525.52s)]
*  The dollar is going, you know, not not going nearly as far as it needs to [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3529.08s)]
*  in order to be able to afford this inflation. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3534.12s)]
*  And so I just mentioned that because this disconnect still continues [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3536.44s)]
*  between the elite in Washington and the reality that they live in [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3541.96s)]
*  versus the reality that the rest of us live in in this country. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3546.6s)]
*  And President Trump recognizes that. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3549.64s)]
*  I'd love to be in a position to help [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3551.56s)]
*  to help secure our country and to get us off this path [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3556.44s)]
*  towards World War Three and nuclear war that [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3561.64s)]
*  the Democrat elite and President Biden's policies have us on right now. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3566.2s)]
*  So my last question, a lot has been written about you [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3572.04s)]
*  and a lot has been written about your spiritual life. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3578.88s)]
*  I don't know if any of it's accurate or not. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3582.2s)]
*  Most politicians don't have a spiritual life, so I think it spooks our media [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3584.84s)]
*  that you clearly do. You can feel it. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3588.32s)]
*  But I want to ask you a specific question. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3590.68s)]
*  So there was a fairly famous exchange on MSNBC a week or two ago [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3591.96s)]
*  with a reporter from Politico who was attacking Christians. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3597.48s)]
*  And that reporter said, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3600.72s)]
*  the crazy thing about Christians is they think their rights come from God. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3603.3599999999997s)]
*  When, of course, implications, they really are granted by Joe Biden. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3607.72s)]
*  Like what? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3610.7599999999998s)]
*  Where do you think our rights come from? [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3613.48s)]
*  Our rights come from God. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3615.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's and it's it's I saw that clip [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3617.24s)]
*  and I laughed when I saw it. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3622.8399999999997s)]
*  And then I was concerned [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3625.04s)]
*  because I saw the people sitting around the table in one of those panels [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3627.96s)]
*  and they all had serious looks on their faces as they were nodding along [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3632.12s)]
*  with this woman saying this as though, like, first of all, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3635.44s)]
*  whatever her spiritual beliefs are or the lack thereof, that's her business. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3639.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. But have you read the Declaration of Independence ever? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3645.3199999999997s)]
*  Certainly not recently, because again, whatever your own personal thoughts may be, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3649.7599999999998s)]
*  the Declaration of Independence is not that they don't mince words. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3656.36s)]
*  Yes. That that our God given rights are inalienable and they do come from our creator. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3660.04s)]
*  And and again, recognizing that as the basis for our founding documents [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3667.4s)]
*  is a very powerful message to every person in politics or in power [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3674.2000000000003s)]
*  that you don't get to try to take away those rights. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3680.4s)]
*  God gives us those rights. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3686.32s)]
*  Only God can take them away. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3687.76s)]
*  And this God complex that so many of our politicians have is at the heart [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3690.2400000000002s)]
*  of the problem is they're so eager to put themselves in a position of power [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3695.56s)]
*  where they they believe that they have the power to say what is true and what is not true, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3699.96s)]
*  that something as undeniable as the fact that I am a woman and you're a man [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3705.8s)]
*  is something that they have now declared to be a fungible label, I suppose, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3710.6000000000004s)]
*  that you can just say, you know, I believe I'm a man, so I'm a man and let it be so. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3718.04s)]
*  This is this is it would be laughable if the consequences weren't so dangerous [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3724.84s)]
*  to have people in power who don't recognize that our our rights and freedoms come from God. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3730.28s)]
*  And you follow that track. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3737.0800000000004s)]
*  And where does it lead is, is they really do believe that they are God or should be God [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3739.1600000000003s)]
*  and that they are self appointing themselves to be in that position of authority [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3745.32s)]
*  and have a lot of tools at their disposal to try to enforce that. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3751.8s)]
*  And that is what is at the heart of the danger that we face as a country right now. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3757.32s)]
*  This is something that transcends party affiliation. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3760.76s)]
*  It transcends how you may like or dislike certain candidates. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3764.2000000000003s)]
*  This is the fact and it's the reality that we have to confront ourselves with. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3769.64s)]
*  If we care about peace, if we care about freedom, if we care about security, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3773.88s)]
*  if we care about our country and our future, the choice is very clear in this election [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3778.04s)]
*  and what we must do in leaving the Democrat Party behind. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3784.68s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, I don't know what's next for you. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3788.92s)]
*  I don't know what's next for any of us, actually, but I hope you will keep talking. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3790.7599999999998s)]
*  I will. Thank you for having me. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3793.96s)]
*  Thank you. It's so good to see you. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJjlDE_Nx8&t=3795.24s)]
