# Tucker Carlson and Jack Posobiec React to the Trump Shooting and the Coup Against Biden
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [July 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo)
*  I think it's pretty clear that if the assassination attempt on Trump had succeeded that Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=0.0s)]
*  would have stayed in. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5.68s)]
*  People can draw their own conclusions from that, but I believe that it seems obvious [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6.68s)]
*  to me that all of these things are connected. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=10.68s)]
*  But he did drop out yesterday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=13.52s)]
*  Apparently, someone dropped out, Tucker. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=16.36s)]
*  Let's start beating. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=30.0s)]
*  What just happened? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=42.2s)]
*  So I'm driving up here to undisclosed location one, and I'm getting these phone calls all [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=43.96s)]
*  of a sudden, just like I got random phone calls a week ago that said Donald Trump has [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=52.6s)]
*  been shot and we didn't even know at the time what was going on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=57.2s)]
*  And then suddenly I'm getting phone calls from my team saying, hey, Joe Biden has just [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=60.580000000000005s)]
*  dropped out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, what do you mean he dropped out? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  Is there an Oval Office address? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  He's not in the Oval Office. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=67.88s)]
*  He's supposed to be in Rehoboth. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=68.88s)]
*  This very suspicious letter, which is signed by Joe Biden in a signature that is different [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=70.92s)]
*  from all of his other signatures, gets put out. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  And it says that he is dropping out of the race. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=81.84s)]
*  It doesn't cite a reason. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=85.14s)]
*  It doesn't cite any specifics as to what's going on. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=86.56s)]
*  Doesn't endorse Kamala Harris in the letter itself. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=89.36s)]
*  And it's just posted to his Twitter account. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=92.54s)]
*  Just X. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=94.8s)]
*  So it's posted up there and we don't hear from him. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=96.08s)]
*  We don't see him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  We don't see Jill. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=101.48s)]
*  We don't see any of the senior staff. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=102.7s)]
*  His senior staffers are the ones informing the cabinet after this. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=104.66s)]
*  So Biden himself doesn't even call his own cabinet to talk to them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  So it's 11 15 on Monday. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=112.08s)]
*  And by the time this is posted, it may change. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  But we have not heard from Biden. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=117.84s)]
*  We have not heard from Biden or seen Biden personally sin. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=119.26s)]
*  No proof of life since Wednesday at this event in Las Vegas where they pulled him out because [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=123.14s)]
*  he was diagnosed with COVID. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=127.98s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  There's been no citing of him at all. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  As of today, I haven't seen anything. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=134.84s)]
*  I've heard anything. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=136.32s)]
*  We get all these reports from someone familiar with the president's thinking, familiar with [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=137.32s)]
*  Joe Biden's thought processes, someone who claims that they just saw Biden. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=142.7s)]
*  But no, there's no Biden. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  There's no evidence of Biden. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=150.06s)]
*  There's no citing of Biden. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=151.06s)]
*  There's no Biden taking a selfie saying, saying, hey, America, thanks for the memories. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=152.5s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=156.82s)]
*  Not a single piece of it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=157.82s)]
*  The closest we have, I think, is his brother, Frank, coming out to CBS yesterday, not on [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=158.82s)]
*  camera, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=162.54s)]
*  Telling the reporter, you know, I love my brother and for whatever time he has left, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=164.14s)]
*  I'll be glad to be with them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=169.78s)]
*  And then the Biden family apparently comes out and says, well, actually, Frank's an alcoholic. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=170.98s)]
*  You can't listen to anything he says. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=173.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy, Frank. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=174.98s)]
*  And he hasn't talked to his brother in weeks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=175.98s)]
*  But that being said, even if he did talk to his brother weeks ago and there was a medical [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=178.46s)]
*  condition that raises to that level, then we don't know. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=181.66s)]
*  Look, that being said, though, what he lines up, what he said, Frank, about Biden, whatever [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=186.14s)]
*  time he has left, that actually lines up with something that I heard from a well-placed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=192.9s)]
*  White House official, not as high as the inner circle or anything like that, but said something [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=199.3s)]
*  about Biden asking questions about, you know, what is it like to have dementia? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=203.78s)]
*  What is it like to lose your mind and realizing that there's no there's no future for you? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=209.46s)]
*  Your future is that is your legacy, of course, but your future personally is you're going [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=217.26s)]
*  to be confined to a bed and you're going to wake up and maybe not remember not recognize [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=222.62s)]
*  people's faces, this type of thing, and that he was asking those questions. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=226.38s)]
*  And so perhaps when you talk to his brother, he said something similar. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=230.34s)]
*  But it's Monday. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=237.34s)]
*  We're in the middle of two wars and we're in the middle of these wars. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=238.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=240.74s)]
*  We're fighting for these wars. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=241.74s)]
*  Americans are fighting in these wars right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=242.74s)]
*  And there may be a third war with Iran approaching quickly. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=246.02s)]
*  That's my read on it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=249.7s)]
*  And there's no proof that Joe Biden even exists right now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=251.66s)]
*  There's nothing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=254.94s)]
*  Even Khrushchev. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=256.14s)]
*  So when when the Soviets wanted to get rid of Khrushchev in 1964, he was on vacation [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=257.14s)]
*  and he's down in the Republic of Georgia now in Abkhazia and he's on the beach and Brezhnev [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=261.74s)]
*  and all the guys get together in the Kremlin and they say, OK, we're done with this guy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=267.46s)]
*  He's old. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=271.26s)]
*  We're pushing him out. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=272.26s)]
*  This is they go there like we're not going to wait for death of Stalin on him. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=273.26s)]
*  We're just going to go in and decide we're making the move. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  They get with the KGB because they're got Brezhnev had already kind of maneuvered everything. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=278.5s)]
*  So his guys were in power and they run the full Unhumans playbook on him and say, you're [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  done. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  They have him come back when he flies back and they say, we have a meeting to discuss [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=287.78000000000003s)]
*  agricultural reports, you know, and they come in KGB intercepts Khrushchev at the airport. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=292.38s)]
*  They bring him in and they hand the letter in front of him and they say, this is the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=297.18s)]
*  letter you're going to sign it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=301.1s)]
*  And Khrushchev at that point goes, you know what, I'm old. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=302.98s)]
*  I always kind of knew this day was going to come. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=306.7s)]
*  So he just goes along with it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=308.7s)]
*  He just totally lays out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=309.7s)]
*  They put him on her house arrest for the rest of his life. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=311.14s)]
*  He's never seen her heard from again. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=312.74s)]
*  He gets like a memoir that comes out. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=314.74s)]
*  But that's the Soviet Union. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=315.74s)]
*  I mean, this is a free and transparent country. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=316.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=320.97999999999996s)]
*  Go on here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=321.97999999999996s)]
*  So that's a crazy other thing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=322.98s)]
*  But what's so bewildering to me is that nobody mentions it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=325.34s)]
*  I mean, I go look at the media right now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=329.09999999999997s)]
*  If wire.com, it's a conspiracy theory to say that this was a coup. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=332.14s)]
*  There's this whole hagiography that's going on right now of, oh, it was this tense decision [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=336.34s)]
*  that Biden was grappling with it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  We don't know any of that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=344.38s)]
*  Oh, of course we do. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=345.38s)]
*  We've been informed by people close to his thinking that this is exactly how it went [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=346.38s)]
*  down. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=353.18s)]
*  And of course, none of us were in the room. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=354.18s)]
*  None of us got to see any of this, but we're all told, no, this is exactly what happened. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=355.18s)]
*  Joe Biden isn't out there himself telling us that any of it's happened. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=359.06s)]
*  And actually, as of the time of recording, we haven't even heard from Kamala Harris [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=362.06s)]
*  yet, who we're told there isn't anything physically wrong with her. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=365.74s)]
*  So why isn't Kamala coming out or Jill coming out or anyone coming out and just talking [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=369.06s)]
*  to the American people and at least giving us some semblance of a story as to what's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=373.78s)]
*  going on? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=378.62s)]
*  As someone who's thought for the last few years that this was not a democracy, it's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=379.62s)]
*  an oligarchy, you know, the real business conducted in the shadows, shielded from public [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=382.38s)]
*  lies and classification laws. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=391.1s)]
*  You know, I thought all that for a while because it's clearly true. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=394.02000000000004s)]
*  But to see that all revealed, they just took the mask off. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=397.06s)]
*  So what you're seeing is a layer being pulled back and the core is never revealed. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  So in the intelligence community, you would say, all right, if your cover is blown or [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=407.38s)]
*  you've got an issue with your cover, you've got an issue with our identity, whatever it [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=411.64000000000004s)]
*  is, someone's asking questions about the operation, you never come out and say, well, you got [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=414.46000000000004s)]
*  me, I'm CIA. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=418.98s)]
*  Yep, yep, yep. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=419.98s)]
*  Langley sent me. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=420.98s)]
*  No, what you would do is that you would peel back a layer and say, okay, you know, I may [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=421.98s)]
*  have lied about this thing, but here's what's really going on. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  But you never get to the full truth. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  So think of it as layers of an onion, for example. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=429.5s)]
*  So you never get to the core. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=432.70000000000005s)]
*  Just one peel comes off and now we're going to go with that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=433.82s)]
*  So the peel that's coming off right now is yes, Leviathan does have to show itself in [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=437.06s)]
*  order for this move to take place. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=442.74s)]
*  And that's what's happening. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=445.22s)]
*  So this idea that you live in, that they promote a lot more than Republicans promote, by the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=446.44s)]
*  way, that we live in a democracy and the people are the ultimate arbiters of sovereignty and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=452.08s)]
*  justice in America. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=455.96s)]
*  And we're fighting to protect our democracy. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=457.46s)]
*  By the way, we're protecting our democracy from Donald Trump, who's the biggest threat [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=459.04s)]
*  to democracy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=462.44s)]
*  But this guy, we don't like him anymore. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=463.74s)]
*  So we're just going to remove him and we're going to pull his money and we're going to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=465.68s)]
*  pull his delegates. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=469.04s)]
*  And then actually the, to me, the most, the most interesting thing that I see is when [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=470.14s)]
*  you watch all these, these delegates, all these delegations are coming out now. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=474.32s)]
*  North Carolina has decided they're behind Kamala Harris and New York says they're behind [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=477.32s)]
*  Kamala Harris and each delegation starts going, this is like watching the election results [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=481.47999999999996s)]
*  in North Korea because what do you mean the delegates are suddenly for Kamala Harris? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=486.03999999999996s)]
*  The delegates were voted for by the people of the Democrat Party, like 14 million people [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=491.08s)]
*  or something voted in this election. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=495.23999999999995s)]
*  And suddenly their votes don't matter anymore. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  It's just, it does seem like we're at a point where all of a sudden it happened fast. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=500.28s)]
*  We're beyond words and rhetoric, beyond politics, beyond process even. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  And we're dealing with people who are absolutely willing to kill other people for power. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=512.48s)]
*  Like that's real. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=515.9599999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=516.9599999999999s)]
*  And, and to stage a coup against an elected president who supposedly got 15 million more [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=517.9599999999999s)]
*  votes in any president. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=523.64s)]
*  Where are all the Biden voters protesting in the streets? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=525.68s)]
*  But it's like nobody even cares about all that stuff. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=527.88s)]
*  None of that was ever real. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=529.44s)]
*  Now they're admitting it's not real. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=530.44s)]
*  And it's just the people with the guns are in charge. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=532.36s)]
*  It does feel that way. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=534.2s)]
*  It's a hundred percent true. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=535.96s)]
*  And this is like, we have the book about it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  And when, when you have an oligarchy that is pushed up against the wall, which, which [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=539.48s)]
*  by the way, they are right now, and this, this is, it's a dangerous point, but also [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=545.28s)]
*  they would not be doing this if they didn't have to. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=549.64s)]
*  If they didn't have to go up against Trump, if the assassin's bullet had been one half [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=552.66s)]
*  inch to the right and things had gone a little bit differently in that field in Butler, Pennsylvania, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  then they wouldn't be having to make these moves because then it would be, oh my gosh, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  you know, this horrible thing, but we're going to, we're going to try John. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=567.12s)]
*  The election must go on. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=570.36s)]
*  America must be safe. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=571.72s)]
*  Joe Biden is the guy, the stable candidate. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  And you'd be hearing the exact opposite from all of them. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=575.4000000000001s)]
*  They'd be talking about how great Biden is presiding over the funeral of Donald Trump [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=577.2800000000001s)]
*  and maybe the state funeral or something like that to sort of appease the right. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=581.32s)]
*  But of course never actually give. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=586.12s)]
*  But I wonder if we'll like remember what we're learning right now, which is that everything [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  that Joe Scarborough and Wolf Blitzer and Margaret Brennan are, you know, all these [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=592.36s)]
*  people it's all lies. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=596.24s)]
*  They'll say anything they need to say. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=599.04s)]
*  The democratic party is not democratic in any sense. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=601.26s)]
*  Its voters are purely puppets. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=604.76s)]
*  So are its politicians. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  It's all fake. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=607.64s)]
*  And that maybe we should just never forget that and say it out loud. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  Like none of this means anything. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=613.72s)]
*  You're yapping about democracy of rule of law, law and order. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=614.88s)]
*  Like it's all fake. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=617.84s)]
*  You're totalitarians. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=619.12s)]
*  You'll kill people who get in your way. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=620.12s)]
*  You can never have power and the rest of us should be prepared to make actual sacrifices [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=621.84s)]
*  to prevent you from getting power because we're going to become a totalitarian state [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=625.96s)]
*  if you do. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=629.6s)]
*  I mean, those seem like the obvious lessons to me. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=630.6s)]
*  The final goal here is the deconstruction of American elections. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=633.28s)]
*  And the idea that it's a 2016, if you look at it, if you look at it through the unhuman's [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=637.4s)]
*  lens, the filter, is that these people have taken control and have been in control for [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=642.88s)]
*  and we could debate exactly when the control point took place. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=648.9200000000001s)]
*  November of 63 probably. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=652.2800000000001s)]
*  That's a pretty good date. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=654.36s)]
*  That's an obvious one. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=655.36s)]
*  Kind of just pull it out of my head. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=657.24s)]
*  And so the idea then is that since that's taken over, the national security state has [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=659.72s)]
*  taken over in league with the oligarchs, et cetera, et cetera, that every president since [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  then has either had to either come directly from there like George H.W. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  Bush, who was the director of CIA before he became president, or been at least acquiescent [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=672.64s)]
*  to their whims and going along with their wars, going along with whatever it is that [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=678.0799999999999s)]
*  the plan is for the empire. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=681.56s)]
*  And then 2016 happens like by accident. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=684.36s)]
*  And because who would have thought this guy could come in and take over. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=687.0799999999999s)]
*  And so you have this problem. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=690.62s)]
*  You have to try and get him out of office the entire time. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=692.24s)]
*  You're trying to like bat him down, you know, kick him off the beachhead and get it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=694.64s)]
*  But at the same time, you're also infiltrating and you're going through the administration. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=698.88s)]
*  You're planning your people in to at least subvert as much as possible. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=702.44s)]
*  So then you get people like Pompeo and people like Bolton get in. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  So they're trying to run a couple of regime change ops in like Venezuela or doing different [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=707.84s)]
*  things in the Gulf, for example. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=712.36s)]
*  And so it never really goes anywhere because at the end of the day, he's still not one [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=714.64s)]
*  of yours. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=718.44s)]
*  So then you get rid of him in 2020. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=719.88s)]
*  Then finally, you have the opportunity to take another bite at the apple. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=722.0s)]
*  Somehow the lawfare doesn't work. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=725.88s)]
*  Somehow all of these things don't work. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=727.52s)]
*  You always know that you have a nuclear option in a situation like that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=729.76s)]
*  And the nuclear option is like November 1963. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=732.12s)]
*  Yeah, just murder the guy. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=735.12s)]
*  But you wouldn't want to do that first. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=737.48s)]
*  And this was something that the East Berliners understood and the Stasi understood that you [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=739.44s)]
*  can just destroy someone's, you can assassinate someone's personality. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=743.12s)]
*  Then it's so much easier than just actually killing them because you might turn them into [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=747.0s)]
*  a martyr. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=751.96s)]
*  But you break their spirit. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=752.96s)]
*  Maybe, you know, if you're lucky, they commit suicide or at least they just stay out of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=753.96s)]
*  public view for forever. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=756.72s)]
*  And this is what was done to dissidents and opposition in East Germany for years. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=759.2s)]
*  And this is what they understood. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  This is why they didn't have to go full great purges of Stalin. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=763.5600000000001s)]
*  Once the 1970s rolled around, now you're starting to get mass media, you're starting to get [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=766.48s)]
*  television, all these tools start to be used. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=769.88s)]
*  And so you destroy someone's reputation with that. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=772.24s)]
*  But then social media comes around. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  And social media, you don't have the you don't have those tools anymore. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=776.52s)]
*  And suddenly you don't have control of the narrative. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=779.88s)]
*  The narrative gets lost to you. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=782.24s)]
*  So through social media, suddenly people can connect and say, Hey, have you noticed this [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=783.52s)]
*  thing? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=786.92s)]
*  I noticed that thing. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=787.92s)]
*  Did you notice that? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=788.92s)]
*  I noticed that thing. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=789.92s)]
*  But the media doesn't seem to be talking about this. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=790.92s)]
*  And yet, when you could say, wait a minute, I'm here, I can see it. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=791.92s)]
*  This is actually happening in front of my eyes. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=793.76s)]
*  Here's a video of it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh, by the way, and I can show you what's going on in real time through live streams, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=796.6800000000001s)]
*  etc, etc. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=800.84s)]
*  And so this becomes a massive, massive problem. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=801.92s)]
*  And so all you're left with at that point, you lose soft power. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=805.2s)]
*  So the oligarchs lose soft power, the machine loses soft power. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=808.0s)]
*  And so they have to go back. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=810.84s)]
*  What do we have left? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=812.48s)]
*  We have hard power. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=813.48s)]
*  Persuasion doesn't work. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=814.48s)]
*  Persuasion isn't working. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=815.48s)]
*  You go force. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=816.48s)]
*  So force is, you might, I don't know, raid somebody's home. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=817.48s)]
*  And you might say that there's some documents there that they shouldn't have. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=820.16s)]
*  And then handcuffs, then convictions. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=824.24s)]
*  But if that doesn't work, the nuclear option of November 1963 is always on the table. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=827.96s)]
*  You know, hypothetically, Tucker, hypothetically. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=834.4s)]
*  Well, I think I think we just saw it. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=836.24s)]
*  I do think that I don't want to think that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=838.08s)]
*  But at all. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=839.96s)]
*  That's the last thing I want to think. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=840.96s)]
*  But but let's just move back. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=841.96s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=843.9200000000001s)]
*  That Leviathan would not be revealing itself right now if it didn't have to. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=846.24s)]
*  If they had total control, total control of the election process, total control of the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=852.9200000000001s)]
*  general election, if they could just, say, flip a switch and put whoever they wanted [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  in office, they would just do that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=860.84s)]
*  You would not see any of these extreme measures being reached to if they could just flip the [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=863.84s)]
*  switch. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=869.76s)]
*  So there's a problem. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=871.56s)]
*  Something's broken down. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=872.56s)]
*  Something is going wrong, because I think what they're really terrified of is a revolt [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=873.56s)]
*  of the people. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=876.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=877.96s)]
*  And I think they've got a lot of internal conflict, too. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=878.96s)]
*  I mean, it's not clear to me. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=880.56s)]
*  I think Obama has more power than Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party, but I'm [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=883.36s)]
*  not certain of that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=887.12s)]
*  But he's got the money on his side. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=888.12s)]
*  So the Clintons have never had the Clintons have always had name, but they've never had [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=889.12s)]
*  money. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=893.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=894.3199999999999s)]
*  And so that's why they're obsessed with money. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=895.3199999999999s)]
*  That's why they do Clinton Foundation. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=896.3199999999999s)]
*  That's why Victor Pinchuk and the Ukrainian oligarchs become the number one for the Clinton [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=897.3199999999999s)]
*  Fed or because they have to. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=899.9200000000001s)]
*  Obama, he's got 50 million here. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=900.9200000000001s)]
*  He's got 150 million there. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=902.84s)]
*  He's taken care of. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=904.32s)]
*  He's spoken for, which, by the way, is also one of the reasons that you don't really see [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=905.32s)]
*  Michelle Obama making any moves to getting into the presidency because all of a sudden [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=909.6s)]
*  you'd have to explain where the money's coming from. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=913.24s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=915.2s)]
*  And that'd be a massive downgrade for her anyway. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=916.2s)]
*  So what happens next? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=919.9200000000001s)]
*  Biden, somebody resigns on his behalf in any case, or this post appears on X, but he does [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=922.92s)]
*  not endorse anybody. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=930.76s)]
*  And that's followed shortly by his endorsement of Kamala Harris, Carmella or whatever we're [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=931.92s)]
*  calling her now. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=936.68s)]
*  And an endorsement attributed to him. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=937.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=939.84s)]
*  Well, exactly right. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=940.84s)]
*  So does she get it? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=941.84s)]
*  Like what, where do we go from here? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=943.4399999999999s)]
*  So there's a few ways to look at it. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=946.68s)]
*  Ultimately, here's where we go, because this is what we've seen play out in Russia. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=949.48s)]
*  We've seen it played out in the Soviet Union. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=953.96s)]
*  So it's like we have to do Kremlinology. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=955.6400000000001s)]
*  Remember the old Kremlinology of the Cold War? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=957.0s)]
*  That's what we have to do for our own government. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=959.72s)]
*  Is Andropov dead or not? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=961.08s)]
*  Yeah, is Andropov dead? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=962.32s)]
*  Is Stalin dead? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=963.32s)]
*  Don't tell the people until we have a line of succession, right? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=966.24s)]
*  First scene of death of Stalin. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=969.2s)]
*  And so quick, grab his Twitter account, something like that. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=971.76s)]
*  And so what you would then do next is you would talk about line of succession and then [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=975.96s)]
*  you might say, create a series of articles talking about conversations that were had [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=979.24s)]
*  before the handover was taken. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=985.32s)]
*  You might say, leak some stories. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=987.62s)]
*  You might have someone running around, but you would never actually have Jill Biden because [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=989.5600000000001s)]
*  she's too upset and she's too angry about what's going on. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=993.2800000000001s)]
*  That's why they can't talk to her. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=996.1600000000001s)]
*  You'd never have Joe Biden because of course he's not 100% on board with this at least [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=997.52s)]
*  yet. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1001.52s)]
*  We have ways of correcting you, and he's still kind of going through that process. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1002.8s)]
*  None of the family members would at that point, other than Frank, of course, who's coming [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1006.74s)]
*  out and going completely off script here. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1009.6s)]
*  The drunk uncle, yeah. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1012.3199999999999s)]
*  And then you've got to smear it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1013.68s)]
*  Okay, he's drunk uncle. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1014.68s)]
*  He's alcoholic. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1015.68s)]
*  Don't listen to him. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1016.68s)]
*  Don't listen to that. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1017.68s)]
*  Only listen to us. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1018.68s)]
*  You must only listen to us. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1019.68s)]
*  So control, so narrative control already. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1020.68s)]
*  And what you're going to see is whoever is the most ruthless, the most brutal, the most [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1023.8s)]
*  well-connected, and whoever's most willing to knife each other in the back will rise [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1031.76s)]
*  to power. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1036.3600000000001s)]
*  So this is, we are in the Ouroboros snake eating his own tail moment that's going on [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  right now. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1042.0400000000002s)]
*  But keep in mind that another snake is always around and another snake is always nearby. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1043.0400000000002s)]
*  So the operative assumption for people like me who are watching but not Democrats and [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1046.72s)]
*  maybe not as informed about what the Democratic Party really is as we should be is that they [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1051.96s)]
*  They have to go with Kamala because she's sort of black, sort of Indian, and a woman [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1057.6s)]
*  for DEI reasons. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1062.7199999999998s)]
*  It's tough for them to pass her over because of that. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1064.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, you would think that. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1066.36s)]
*  I mean, that's what I read on it. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1067.36s)]
*  I mean, she's a moron in a job she doesn't deserve. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1068.36s)]
*  That's the whole point of DEI is to elevate people who don't deserve their jobs to positions [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1071.52s)]
*  of power, obviously. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1074.6799999999998s)]
*  And that they have to kind of roll with that because the constituencies within the party [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1076.6399999999999s)]
*  will flip out if they don't pick her. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1079.9599999999998s)]
*  I've just assumed that from day one. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1082.6399999999999s)]
*  That's why she's such a problem. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1084.9599999999998s)]
*  But now I'm starting to think- [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1086.52s)]
*  In 2020, she was never the original pick to begin with. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1087.52s)]
*  I'm aware, yeah. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1089.52s)]
*  This is everything you're describing is why she was picked then because in the George [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1090.52s)]
*  Floyd moment during the racial reckoning, as a sailor puts it, that he wanted like Klobuchar [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1093.76s)]
*  or he was even talking about Gretchen Whitmer back then in 2020. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1099.68s)]
*  But then George Floyd happens, they go full BLM and suddenly it's okay. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1103.6000000000001s)]
*  We've got to pick someone that checks all these boxes. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1107.68s)]
*  For sure. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1110.08s)]
*  And I thought that was a mistake and that it puts them in a box that it's hard to get [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1111.08s)]
*  out of. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1115.56s)]
*  But now I'm thinking, because I think we've just watched like the most brutal exercise [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1116.56s)]
*  of raw undisguised power I've ever seen in this country, that they're not hemmed in by [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1121.8s)]
*  that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1128.6399999999999s)]
*  Like they really don't care. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1129.6399999999999s)]
*  They don't care what their own constituencies think. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1130.6399999999999s)]
*  They can just install somebody and because the Democratic Party is not an ideological [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1132.46s)]
*  movement, it's just a bunch of people clustered together for power. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1136.6799999999998s)]
*  Leftism is not ideological. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1141.3999999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  It's never been. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1143.3999999999999s)]
*  It's a tactic. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1144.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not spiritual, I would say also, but whatever. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1146.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1147.24s)]
*  But it's certainly not ideological. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1148.24s)]
*  It doesn't even matter what the ideas are. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1149.24s)]
*  But at this point they can kind of put anyone in. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1151.1200000000001s)]
*  And if they think Gavin Newsom has the best shot and he's a white man, but like, so what? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1153.2s)]
*  They'll do that. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1156.96s)]
*  Well, and so this is the way that DEI would reflect itself in a pure power system, in [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1157.96s)]
*  a pure power politics system is what constituencies can you bring to bear? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1164.3600000000001s)]
*  So the fact that she was able to get Clyburn on board is huge because Clyburn gives you [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1169.88s)]
*  all of the vote processing centers and the inner city churches and he's able to from [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1174.8s)]
*  Detroit to Milwaukee to Philadelphia to Atlanta. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1180.6399999999999s)]
*  These are the key centers that you're going to need. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1184.9599999999998s)]
*  This is of course, Clyburn of course is credited for putting Biden in office and many people [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1186.6s)]
*  have cited his nominate or his endorsement of Biden as really being the deal that won [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1190.8s)]
*  Biden the primary. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1195.0s)]
*  It was, yeah. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1196.0s)]
*  It clearly was. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1197.0s)]
*  And so I've always said, and this is something where Steve Bannon and I have actually disagreed [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1198.0s)]
*  on this, where I've said, I don't see how Gavin Newsom makes it out of Georgia. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1202.44s)]
*  I just, in a real primary situation, this, whatever faith is. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1208.16s)]
*  Well, of course I agree with you completely, but for the purposes of the November election, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1211.72s)]
*  maybe they don't have to pick Kamlo. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1216.96s)]
*  We traveled to an awful lot of countries on this show, to some free countries, the dwindling [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1219.04s)]
*  number and a lot of not very free countries, places famous for government censorship. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1223.3200000000002s)]
*  And wherever we go, we use a virtual private network of VPN and we use ExpressVPN. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1228.56s)]
*  We do it to access the free and open internet. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1235.6399999999999s)]
*  But the interesting thing is when we come back here to the United States, we still use [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1240.08s)]
*  ExpressVPN. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1243.3999999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1244.3999999999999s)]
*  Big tech surveillance. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1245.3999999999999s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1246.96s)]
*  It's not just North Korea that monitors every move its citizens make. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1247.96s)]
*  No. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  That same thing happens right here in the United States and in Canada and Great Britain [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1253.3999999999999s)]

*  Did you know that? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1279.64s)]
*  Well, we did. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1280.64s)]
*  And that's why we use ExpressVPN. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1281.64s)]
*  And because we do, our internet provider never knows where we're going on the internet. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1283.92s)]
*  They never hear it in the first place. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1288.4s)]
*  That's because 100% of our online activity is routed through ExpressVPN's secure encrypted [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1290.3200000000002s)]

*  Why? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1378.76s)]
*  Because the process has no legitimacy. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1379.8000000000002s)]
*  And nakedly, we can see that it has no legitimacy. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1382.0400000000002s)]
*  The delegations immediately flip at the flip of a switch. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1384.3200000000002s)]
*  There's no hearing from Biden. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1389.1200000000001s)]
*  There's no hearing from Biden. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1391.0s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1392.64s)]
*  The delegates who are legally pledged, legally pledged to Biden, who were nominated through [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1394.12s)]
*  the legitimate, legitimate, right? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1399.36s)]
*  Their process, their official process, all of a sudden switch their delegations without [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1402.28s)]
*  even hearing from the guy that they're supposed to be tied to. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1407.32s)]
*  No, this is obviously the raw sign of Leviathan. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1410.7199999999998s)]
*  This is Leviathan's power. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1415.4399999999998s)]

*  And what they're using Obama for is to give some veneer of legitimacy and credibility [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1421.76s)]
*  to the process. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1427.2s)]
*  So he's saying there's an open process. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1429.8s)]
*  I'm not endorsing. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1431.32s)]

*  There's no intention, which I think what you're saying is Obama, when he endorses an open [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1435.56s)]
*  primary, which he's done, he knows there will not be an open. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1439.28s)]

*  And I think essentially that what you see here is that the money has all lined up behind [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1448.0s)]
*  Kamala. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1453.04s)]

*  We've got four weeks before the DNC. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1457.48s)]
*  Also, you've got a huge accounting problem because you can't, the $300 million that's [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1459.24s)]
*  sitting in that, what was the Biden Harris account, which is now Harris for president, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1463.28s)]
*  you know, what are you just going to give that $300 million over to somebody? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1468.0s)]
*  You've got to transfer all of this stuff. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1471.04s)]
*  It's going to take a ton of time and you can't do that without the acquiescence of, again, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1472.8400000000001s)]
*  whoever's controlling Biden's signature right now. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1477.36s)]
*  So it's just much easier on that level. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1480.84s)]
*  How can Biden remain president of the country? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1483.3999999999999s)]
*  Same way he's been president the whole time. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1487.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1489.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's a, no, I get what you're saying. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1490.3999999999999s)]
*  And not to digress once again, but at this point, does anyone doubt 2020 was rigged? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1494.04s)]
*  But I will say something has changed from 2020 to 2024. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1498.9199999999998s)]
*  Obviously COVID is not around anymore. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1503.8799999999999s)]
*  There's been laws that have been placed on the books in those states and he's just been [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1505.92s)]
*  in such a collapsed state. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1510.1200000000001s)]
*  So with Biden as president, to answer your question, it doesn't make any sense. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1512.0400000000002s)]
*  If you're not mentally well enough, which again, he has not stated, no one has stated [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1517.0400000000002s)]
*  this because it's all about polling. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1520.92s)]
*  It's all about the issue of polling. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1523.6000000000001s)]
*  Because his statement yesterday didn't explain why he's not running for president. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1525.6000000000001s)]
*  It would be best for the party and best for the country. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1529.64s)]
*  Remember he put party first. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1531.48s)]
*  Whoever put party first. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1532.92s)]
*  So best for the party, best for the country for me to stand down. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1534.74s)]
*  Stand down. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1538.86s)]
*  I mean, stand down. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1539.86s)]
*  If you're fighting for your country. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1541.14s)]
*  Why not just take it? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1542.58s)]
*  I mean, if you can prevent him from running again, you can prevent him from serving now. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1543.58s)]
*  Why wouldn't they just take him out or kill him? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1547.08s)]
*  They're certainly capable of that. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1549.9s)]
*  I think it's fair to say. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1551.5s)]
*  It would honestly be okay. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1553.04s)]
*  So let's say you're, you'd say you're they, you're them, you're the Democratic party. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1554.78s)]
*  It's leaders. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1558.78s)]
*  You're the money people, the Democratic party. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1559.78s)]
*  You would want honestly, and you know, not to give them advice, but you would, wouldn't [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1561.34s)]
*  you want Kamala Harris to have some power of the bully pulpit, power of some kind of [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1565.98s)]
*  record to her name? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1572.5s)]
*  Because whatever record she has, the only things that she was associated with the administration [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1573.9399999999998s)]
*  other than this wild series of interviews are the border. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1578.4399999999998s)]
*  And oh, that little, there was that country in Europe and they were having some issues [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1583.06s)]
*  in 2012. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1586.76s)]
*  Oh, Ukraine, right. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1587.76s)]
*  They gave her Ukraine and said that you're going to, she goes the one who flies to the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1588.76s)]
*  Munich conference in February of 2022 and says, there is no question on my mind that [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1591.3s)]
*  Ukraine will definitely be in NATO. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1597.46s)]
*  And she caused the war in Ukraine. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1599.4199999999998s)]
*  So putting in baits like the next day, you know, because, and they give that tour because [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1601.3s)]
*  there's been a shade war going on between Biden and Kamala from day one of this administration. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1605.3799999999999s)]
*  It's very clear. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1610.02s)]
*  We've been reporting out of human events. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1611.02s)]
*  I think everyone sees it now. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1612.1399999999999s)]
*  It appears to be very bright, but it's so obvious they hate each other. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1613.74s)]
*  these obviously will fail assignments and say, great, pin it on her. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1618.18s)]
*  But the problem is that's all backfired now because now if they want her to be the one [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1622.6200000000001s)]
*  who's got any credibility, who's got, who's going to be signing off on things, they know [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1628.38s)]
*  she's a complete nut job. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1632.8200000000002s)]
*  And so you put something like that in office and she's going to be signing off on the proxy [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1634.48s)]
*  war with Russia. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1639.3400000000001s)]
*  She's going to be signing off on the proxy war with Iran, perhaps the direct war with [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1640.3400000000001s)]
*  China. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1644.66s)]
*  Who knows what comes next? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1645.66s)]
*  This is someone who's totally unstable. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1647.02s)]
*  So what it tells me is that they don't quite have all their hooks in. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1648.62s)]
*  But one of the things that I'm hearing Tucker is that there are people in the Democrat donor [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1652.86s)]
*  base who are thinking like what I'm saying right now, that it doesn't make any sense [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1658.04s)]
*  for us to say she should be president when she could be president right now. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1662.62s)]
*  That if she's this wonderful, amazing president. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1667.18s)]
*  Why wouldn't she run as an incumbent? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1668.18s)]
*  I've thought that since July 1st, when I talked to a very knowledgeable Democrat, of course, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1669.3799999999999s)]
*  make Biden out, make her president. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1675.82s)]
*  She's running from the Oval Office. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1677.34s)]
*  Why wouldn't you want that? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1679.22s)]
*  The only thing I could think of is this perhaps was part of the deal they made with the Bidens. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1680.9399999999998s)]
*  We'll let you run out the clock. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1686.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, these are people who are willing to do anything, say anything. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1687.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't think that deal is going to last. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1693.54s)]
*  I wouldn't think so. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1695.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't think it lasts at all. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1696.4199999999998s)]
*  So Hunter Biden is facing felony tax charges, I think in October. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1697.52s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1701.4199999999998s)]
*  For about five more minutes. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1702.4199999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1703.4199999999998s)]
*  So you just pardon Hunter Biden's, clean up the messes, make sure that Jill Biden has [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1704.8200000000002s)]
*  enough money to live in Rehoboth for the rest of her life. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1709.0600000000002s)]
*  And it's not hard and take him out. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1712.98s)]
*  I mean, it does seem like the logic train leads you to President Carmella Harris very [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1715.14s)]
*  quickly. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1720.78s)]
*  Very quickly. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1721.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1722.78s)]
*  And so and it makes sense because that way it gives you the power of she's the first [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1723.78s)]
*  woman president. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1727.9s)]
*  How are you? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1728.9s)]
*  And you can dig into this chronic propaganda that we've been surrounded by that women are [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1729.9s)]
*  better than men, that women should be first, that women should have all the power in society. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1736.14s)]
*  Well, here is the first woman president. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1741.3400000000001s)]
*  And how dare you run against the first woman president? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1743.22s)]
*  I wonder if anyone buys that anymore. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1746.46s)]
*  Some people do. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1749.5600000000002s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1751.16s)]
*  I mean, I was kind of agnostic on the question, but we haven't seen big successes from female [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1752.16s)]
*  leaders. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1757.3000000000002s)]
*  And I say that as a lover of women. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1758.34s)]
*  But I mean, it's at some point, if you make a claim, you do kind of have to substantiate [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1760.18s)]
*  it. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1764.62s)]
*  And like, for example, I don't know, female Secret Service agents. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1765.62s)]
*  No, I just think like, where is the evidence for that? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1767.06s)]
*  I mean, I'm talking about specifically political leadership. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1769.34s)]
*  Obviously you shouldn't have what we saw on last Saturday in Butler Township. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1771.78s)]
*  Obviously that was insane. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1777.26s)]
*  But like everyone, you know, of female leader, political leaders will be more conciliatory. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1778.58s)]
*  There'll be more peace, less war. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1783.86s)]
*  You've seen exactly the opposite. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1785.3799999999999s)]
*  The war was driven by a woman, actually, Toria Newland. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1787.6200000000001s)]
*  Hillary Clinton is the most bloodthirsty person I've ever seen on the public stage. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1792.02s)]
*  Like, Madeleine Albright, a total ghoul. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1795.5s)]
*  A million Iraqi children. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1798.82s)]
*  So what? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1800.18s)]
*  Nasty and stupid person. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1801.18s)]
*  I know, knew Madeleine Albright. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1802.18s)]
*  Nasty, stupid person also. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1803.98s)]
*  But leaving that aside, there doesn't seem to be any evidence for these claims at all. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1805.3s)]
*  In fact, the opposite appears to be true unless I'm missing something. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1810.38s)]
*  I mean, I guess you're not supposed to say this because the idea is so important that [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1812.98s)]
*  you can't marshal evidence for or against. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1817.18s)]
*  You just have to accept it. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1819.38s)]
*  But I'm a free man and I just don't see any evidence that female leadership is more likely [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1820.38s)]
*  to get us to peace than male leadership. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1825.66s)]
*  I see the opposite evidence. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1827.42s)]
*  There's even some scholarship that, you know, we actually do have a track record of this [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1828.66s)]
*  because if you look at, for example, the Kingdom of England. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1831.42s)]
*  And so the United Kingdom, they've had kings and queens for several centuries now. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1835.3600000000001s)]
*  And at one point, obviously, the throne had real power. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1839.94s)]
*  Not now. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1842.98s)]
*  The communists seem to have real power in England right now. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1844.46s)]
*  Farage is doing a great job, but that remains to be seen. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1847.02s)]
*  There's some scholarship that shows that when England had a queen, they were actually more [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1852.7s)]
*  likely to go to war. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1858.34s)]
*  Whereas when England had a king, they were more likely to seek peace through diplomatic [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1860.38s)]
*  means. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1864.1s)]
*  That does not surprise me based on what I've seen in the United States over the past 20 [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1865.82s)]
*  years. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1869.38s)]
*  I don't think, you know, look, as long as we're throwing out all of our standards and [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1870.38s)]
*  norms and traditions and we're starting at year zero, which is clearly the goal here, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1876.22s)]
*  when Kamala says, you know, we're unburdened by the past, which she's really saying is [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1880.46s)]
*  welcome to Campuchia, exactly. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1883.5s)]
*  Then we should just be completely honest about everything all the time. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1887.94s)]
*  Why not? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1890.5400000000002s)]
*  I mean, they already would kill you if they could. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1891.5400000000002s)]
*  So why not just be totally honest? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1893.5800000000002s)]
*  And I'm just kind of interested in this idea of female political leadership being this [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1894.94s)]
*  thing that it demonstrably isn't. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1900.02s)]
*  And so why do we feel, what does the right feel like we have to go along with these pieties, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1902.82s)]
*  which are clearly lies? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1906.98s)]
*  Like, why? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1907.98s)]
*  Let's just stop doing that. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1908.98s)]
*  Well, and think, Tucker, we were, to go back to it again, and we'll dig into it some more, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1910.98s)]
*  but we were, since we're on the topic, we were what, half an inch away from Kamala Harris [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1915.3400000000001s)]
*  versus Nikki Haley. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1920.46s)]
*  That could have been our election. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1922.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1923.98s)]
*  So let's get to the thing that, I mean, one of the, you know, I'm not that serious. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1924.98s)]
*  I'm not surprised that the Democratic party, which did not want Joe Biden in the first [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1930.54s)]
*  place, they wanted Pete Buttigieg. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1933.3s)]
*  That's right. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1934.86s)]
*  And they put Biden in, they knew he was senile. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1935.86s)]
*  I knew he was senile because one of his, because his sister told a friend of mine, that's who, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1938.86s)]
*  if I knew as a right-wing talk show host, then trust me, every big, Jeffrey Katzenberg [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1942.9799999999998s)]
*  knew, I mean, come on, let's stop lying. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1947.5s)]
*  The Germans did this with Hindenburg in 1933. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1949.2199999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1951.4599999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1952.4599999999998s)]
*  Like this is the one guy who's kind of palatable, but we can control him. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1953.4599999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1956.34s)]
*  But you know, as all, he was always late stage Woodrow Wilson. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1957.34s)]
*  They knew that. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1960.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1961.1s)]
*  All the surprises. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1962.1s)]
*  They liked that. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1963.1s)]
*  Of course they did. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1964.1s)]
*  Tucker, Tucker, Joe Biden is not being pulled from the presidency because he has dementia. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1965.1s)]
*  He's being pulled because the American people found out. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1969.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1971.86s)]
*  They liked the dementia. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1972.86s)]
*  And he can no longer win. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1973.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1974.86s)]
*  So I'm not that surprised by what they're doing and they're discarding him like a used [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1975.86s)]
*  condom and I almost feel sorry for him, but he's such a nasty, evil person that it's hard [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1978.78s)]
*  to feel sorry for him. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1983.98s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1984.98s)]
*  I'm not shocked. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1985.98s)]
*  Kristi Noem was nicer to her dog than they are being to Joe Biden right now. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1987.94s)]
*  But those are the rules. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1991.3s)]
*  Like it always ends in tears. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1992.3s)]
*  It's not a sentimental business, but the attempted murder of the Republican nominee, you know, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=1995.06s)]
*  nine days ago, that's, we're sort of blowing past that now. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2002.02s)]
*  So let's go back to Butler Township, Pennsylvania. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2006.3s)]
*  Well, and Tucker, they want us to blow past that. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2009.74s)]
*  Because what's the one thing that could knock an assassination attempt out of the news [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2013.5s)]
*  cycle, out of the conversation, the collapse of an American president? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2018.06s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2022.46s)]
*  So let's just get the sun tape. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2023.98s)]
*  If you don't mind, you know, given what we know now, and I pray we'll know a lot more, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2026.82s)]
*  but as of this morning, tell us what happened that day. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2032.3s)]
*  So we've got, I've got here Senator Johnson's office, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has been [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2036.82s)]
*  kind enough to send us a preliminary copy of their reporting into the situation. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2041.62s)]
*  Very fresh fog of war, caveat, caveat, caveat on all this stuff. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2048.98s)]
*  Because this is what's coming from them. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2054.18s)]
*  We are told that... [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2057.38s)]
*  Can I say one thing? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2058.38s)]
*  I think whatever you think of, I like Ron Johnson, but even if I didn't, he's got, he [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2059.38s)]
*  clearly has a willingness to pull threads in a way most senators do not. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2062.8599999999997s)]
*  And he's obviously got some decent investigators on his staff, given what he did with COVID. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2067.58s)]
*  So I think he's someone who wants the truth of things. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2072.18s)]
*  It does feel that way to me. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2074.42s)]
*  And that he burnt with a burning desire. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2075.74s)]
*  By the way, there are two senators of Pennsylvania. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2077.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't see them doing any of this. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2079.74s)]
*  But Johnson has people on his... [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2082.18s)]
*  I don't know who they are, but he came up with stuff during COVID that nobody else got. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2084.1s)]
*  So I think that we should consider what you're about to say in light of that. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2087.54s)]
*  These are predominantly interviews that were conducted through the local police. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2093.06s)]
*  And that just right off the start should tell you something. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2099.82s)]
*  Because if Johnson's talking to local police, wait a minute, this is the United States Senator. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2103.26s)]
*  Shouldn't he have direct access to the Secret Service? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2107.7400000000002s)]
*  Shouldn't he have direct access to the ATF, to the FBI, all of these things? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2110.36s)]
*  And so as his office has been going through the investigation, they suddenly say, well, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2113.7400000000002s)]
*  yeah, we talked to one guy from the ATF who was sort of there, but then he went dark on [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2117.7000000000003s)]
*  us. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2120.94s)]
*  So we talked to a few people at the Secret Service and they push us to the spokesman, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2121.94s)]
*  like you're some reporter. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2124.86s)]
*  We talked to a few people at FBI, but nothing. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2127.54s)]
*  And then so local police is saying, whoa, wait a minute, we'll tell you whatever you [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2132.78s)]
*  want to know. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2135.94s)]
*  So why is it that local police are being more forthcoming than our actual government? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2137.06s)]
*  This is why they defunded the police in the first place. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2141.3s)]
*  It's not because they're against police. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2144.02s)]
*  They seek a police state. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2145.66s)]
*  They're against anybody with guns they can't control. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2147.82s)]
*  That's why they're trying to take your AR. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2150.46s)]
*  That's the way to understand it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2151.98s)]
*  The goal of defund the police is a national police force, eventually. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2152.98s)]
*  Yeah, guys with guns, they can control. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2155.42s)]
*  And Sharp Dings came out and said this. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2157.46s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2158.94s)]
*  It's so obviously true. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2159.94s)]
*  Anyway, I keep interrupting you. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2160.94s)]
*  So number one, top line, Secret Service did not attend a security briefing that morning. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2161.94s)]
*  The morning of the event. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2167.7400000000002s)]
*  The morning of the event. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2169.2200000000003s)]
*  So and we can drop back and just explain the whole thing. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2170.2200000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is having a political rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2172.82s)]
*  This is Western Pennsylvania, about 40 miles north or so of the city of Pittsburgh. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2175.7400000000002s)]
*  On the same day, same evening, Jill Biden, the First Lady of the United States, is holding [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2180.34s)]
*  a dinner event in Pittsburgh. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2185.38s)]
*  The context of all this is that the RNC is taking place two days in advance of it. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2188.1400000000003s)]
*  And so the RNC is taking place. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2193.32s)]
*  Jill Biden's got the event. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2195.02s)]
*  Donald Trump is at the event, both in the same Secret Service field office area. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2196.2200000000003s)]
*  Now, there's also a lot of Secret Service down in Milwaukee, where you and I were at [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2200.1400000000003s)]
*  the RNC. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2204.6600000000003s)]
*  So Secret Service is totally stretched at this point. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2205.6600000000003s)]
*  It's not like a normal situation. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2208.9s)]
*  The security posture because of this, because of the lack of resources, is much lower. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2211.2200000000003s)]
*  The normal people who would be around President Trump aren't there. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2216.7400000000002s)]
*  His A-Team, as they're called, aren't necessarily there as much. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2221.46s)]
*  People are spread to all these different locations. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2224.82s)]
*  This is the context. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2226.84s)]
*  We also know that there was a strong theory that President Trump would bring his vice [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2227.84s)]
*  presidential pick to that rally. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2233.6s)]
*  And certainly this was in discussion, held right on the border of where? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2236.5s)]
*  Ohio. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2239.94s)]
*  President Trump that morning, we now know, had a meeting with Senator J.D. Vance, who [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2240.94s)]
*  went on to become the nominee, although that pick was not made until Monday. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2244.26s)]
*  So J.D. Vance doesn't end up traveling with him. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2247.02s)]
*  Well, I happen to know that that was the plan or one of several plans that was under discussion. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2248.82s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2254.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2255.42s)]
*  And I heard it from a bunch of different people. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2256.42s)]
*  I heard it from the campaign. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2258.62s)]
*  So this was known. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2260.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2261.1s)]
*  I'm hearing the exact same thing. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2262.1s)]
*  Part of partially the forcing function for that is because the vice presidential nominee [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2263.8599999999997s)]
*  must be named on the first day of the convention. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2267.2999999999997s)]
*  And so the idea is, well, why not just bring him to a rally and do it there and have it [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2269.94s)]
*  be? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2275.46s)]
*  And I haven't quite gotten, have you heard why it was that they decided not to bring [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2276.46s)]
*  him? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2280.14s)]
*  Yeah, I have. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2281.14s)]
*  And I think it was just a political question. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2283.72s)]
*  Where are we going to get more bang for this announcement? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2285.8999999999996s)]
*  But I do know that as of a few days before that was actively being discussed. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2288.1s)]
*  It's a long way of saying what you just said, which is that people watching this had every [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2294.46s)]
*  reason to believe that Trump and his VP pick would be there. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2299.2599999999998s)]
*  So you see, and of course, Rubio had just been at an event in Trump Doral, I think a [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2303.42s)]
*  few days before, and he was someone who was also very heavily lobbied. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2307.7s)]
*  We can talk about that later, but heavily lobbied for as vice president from a number [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2310.74s)]
*  of people around that same time period. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2315.66s)]
*  He had been at a rally in Doral, and yet Trump did not bring him on stage. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2317.94s)]
*  So a lot of people thought that that was sort of the death knell for that, that potential [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2321.98s)]
*  candidacy. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2325.82s)]
*  So Trump is holding this rally. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2326.82s)]
*  And about 10 minutes into the start of the rally. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2329.3s)]
*  Wait, first though, the Secret Service didn't even show up at the morning briefing the day [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2332.5800000000004s)]
*  of the rally. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2336.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right here. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2337.1400000000003s)]
*  Secret Service did not attend a security briefing provided to local special weapons and tactics [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2339.02s)]
*  SWAT and sniper teams the morning of July 13. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2342.94s)]
*  So when you're holding an event like this, going back to security posture, typically [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2345.18s)]
*  you're going to need to staff up. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2349.94s)]
*  So you're going to need extra bodies, you're going to need augments, you're going to need [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2351.74s)]
*  more CS, not counter sniper teams, you're going to need all of these things. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2354.54s)]
*  Because a huge event, outdoor event since November 1963 has always been and will always [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2357.62s)]
*  be the most potentially fatal event that a politician can hold, of course. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2362.46s)]
*  And so they know that for one of these outdoor events, the first thing you have to worry [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2367.8599999999997s)]
*  about is all the tall buildings, all the tall implements. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2371.3399999999997s)]
*  This is why they're held in fields, by the way, for the most part, rather than like inner [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2373.9s)]
*  cities, because cities would have more vantage points, you've got windows, you've got all [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2377.02s)]
*  sorts of stuff. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2380.1000000000004s)]
*  Dealey Plaza, you know, we can all do the math on this. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2381.1000000000004s)]
*  And so they bring in augments from state police, they bring in augments from the local Butler [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2384.6200000000003s)]
*  County Sheriff, they bring augments from the Butler Township police. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2390.02s)]
*  And to say, okay, you're going to be working with us. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2393.82s)]
*  No, every single presidential event is controlled by the Secret Service. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2395.42s)]
*  And this woman, Kimberly Sheetal, speaking of female leadership, it tells us that, well, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2398.9s)]
*  these areas were assigned to the local police. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2404.6200000000003s)]
*  And that's just not true. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2406.46s)]
*  They may have been in areas that were considered outside the perimeter. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2407.98s)]
*  But the Secret Service has command of every single hierarchy for a presidential visit, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2412.46s)]
*  period, full stop. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2417.98s)]
*  So anyone who's brought into this is working through their operational plan. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2419.04s)]
*  So the CONOP is done, concept of operations would be done by the Secret Service and then [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2422.58s)]
*  disseminated to these teams. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2426.46s)]
*  However, we're told that at the basic sync meeting that you would have been having that [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2428.5s)]
*  morning, Secret Service wasn't even there. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2432.42s)]
*  So the local police say, okay, morning of, it's like the coach meeting the team before [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2434.98s)]
*  the game. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2440.46s)]
*  Secret Service is responsible for protecting Trump. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2441.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2443.14s)]
*  But they couldn't even go to the meeting that morning. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2444.14s)]
*  So let me ask you a question. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2446.42s)]
*  And this is the meeting where you're going through what frequency are we on, guys? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2447.78s)]
*  You know, hey, I'm Jack, here's Tucker, we're going to be out there. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2453.82s)]
*  Okay, you got the building, we're going to be in here. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2457.7s)]
*  So you would be able to communicate. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2459.62s)]
*  You would go through a communications plan. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2461.2999999999997s)]
*  You'd go through the basic workflow of the day. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2462.7s)]
*  You'd go through your pattern of life. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2464.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2466.8999999999996s)]
*  You would mention if you, I don't know, saw someone flying a drone around or something [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2467.8999999999996s)]
*  like that, that type of information could be disseminated. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2471.14s)]
*  Or if there were any local, you know, local groups that they had an eye on, you might [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2473.98s)]
*  put out a six pack or something like that. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2478.24s)]
*  Hey, be advised. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2479.8199999999997s)]
*  These are some of the things that we're tracking. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2480.8199999999997s)]
*  These are some of the people that we're looking at. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2482.4199999999996s)]
*  If you had something like that, this is the meeting where you would do that. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2484.7s)]
*  Secret service doesn't go crazy. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2488.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2490.98s)]
*  So then what happens? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2491.98s)]
*  So local law enforcement was siloed, no direct radio contact because they didn't go to the [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2494.98s)]
*  meeting. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2501.1s)]
*  They had no way of contacting directly to the secret service snipers who were inside. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2502.1s)]
*  So you've got these police teams outside. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2507.02s)]
*  Even during the event, they had no way to contact them. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2508.4199999999996s)]
*  They had to contact them through an intermediary. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2510.66s)]
*  So you'd set up a tactical operation center or a communication. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2513.14s)]
*  I think it was called the Butler communication center in this case, or the talk. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2515.8199999999997s)]
*  So you'd go through the talk and then the talk has a liaison and liaison goes to the [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2518.8199999999997s)]
*  secret service. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2522.02s)]
*  And then the secret service has to go through their liaison back to the talk. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2523.14s)]
*  And then the talk goes back to the police, as opposed to just being on the same frequency [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2525.98s)]
*  and saying, Hey, there's a guy crawling on the building. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2529.54s)]
*  So who was this guy and how did he get there? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2532.2799999999997s)]
*  What do we know about him? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2534.62s)]
*  This individual. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2535.94s)]
*  And I want to skip ahead a little bit in the report because there's, there's a lot in this [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2537.7s)]
*  report. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2541.14s)]
*  Even by the way, let's let me say this real quick. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2542.14s)]
*  Section five secret service was initially not going to send snipers to the rally according [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2546.8599999999997s)]
*  to local law enforcement. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2551.62s)]
*  Social media are great. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2553.62s)]
*  They're important are the main way we communicate with each other. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2554.66s)]
*  They're where politics happen in this country. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2557.58s)]
*  But one of the problems with social media is that the rules change. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2559.98s)]
*  The people in charge don't want you to say something. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2562.7s)]
*  They don't tell you that. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2565.1s)]
*  And the next thing you know, you're without a platform. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2566.7s)]
*  Well, now you have an option. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2569.7400000000002s)]
*  Parler, it's back. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2571.7400000000002s)]
*  The original free speech app taken off the Internet by the censors has come back in full [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2573.5400000000004s)]
*  force. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2579.94s)]
*  Parler was the first big app to be pulled off because it was the first big app to make [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2580.94s)]
*  free speech a top priority. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2586.5800000000004s)]
*  Now other platforms may be relaxing their policies and they change a lot, but Parler [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2589.0200000000004s)]

*  in the industry. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2603.22s)]
*  It is now launched on a hyper scale private cloud called Parler cloud. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2604.22s)]

*  How does that even happen? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2693.54s)]
*  An outdoor rally with a guy who's the former president of the United States, who is imminently [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2695.1400000000003s)]
*  becoming the nominee for president of the United States. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2701.84s)]
*  Someone who we just know, it's just inherent that Donald Trump has multiple credible threats [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2704.34s)]
*  to his life at all times for the last decade or so. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2709.5s)]
*  And they weren't even going to provide counter sniper teams at first to this rally, which, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2713.38s)]
*  as I just said, is outdoors, which is the most potentially fatal, the most dangerous [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2718.1000000000004s)]
*  position a politician can ever put themselves in. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2722.1800000000003s)]
*  We're told the counter sniper team showed up like the day before to actually do some [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2726.06s)]
*  of the casing, not a week prior. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2729.54s)]
*  And I've done presidential visits, I've done overseas stuff with presidents and detail [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2732.02s)]
*  and you're out there a week before you're going through the motorcade route, you're [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2736.34s)]
*  checking bridges, you're doing all that stuff. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2740.1800000000003s)]
*  None of that was done here. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2743.34s)]
*  None of it. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2745.46s)]
*  Eight days before the rally, local police are informed. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2747.1800000000003s)]
*  Five days before the rally, they meet with the Secret Service and they're informed that [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2750.06s)]
*  the rally will be held at the Butler farm grounds. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2754.1s)]
*  Three days before the rally, Secret Service conducts a site visit. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2756.4s)]
*  Just three days before they conducted the site visit. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2759.6200000000003s)]
*  At that point, no, no counter sniper teams. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2762.46s)]
*  On the day of the rally, at 9 a.m., they hold the briefing. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2765.34s)]
*  46 page slide deck only from the local Butler ESU. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2767.82s)]
*  Local SWAT and sniper units are there, but the staging locations are laid out. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2771.88s)]
*  Secret Service doesn't attend. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2776.3s)]
*  According to attendees of the briefing, no Secret Service or other federal law enforcement [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2777.9s)]
*  is present for this briefing. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2780.82s)]
*  Secret Service had not initially intended to provide sniper units, but changed course [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2782.6000000000004s)]
*  for currently unclear reasons. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2786.46s)]
*  The briefing included an outline of the security perimeter for the event and areas of responsibility [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2789.7200000000003s)]
*  or AORs. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2793.2200000000003s)]
*  At 9.27 a.m., concurrent, Thomas Matthew Crooks, the alleged shooter, enters a Home Depot [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2794.5s)]
*  located in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2800.78s)]
*  CCTV footage shows the shooter entering alone. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2802.94s)]
*  A couple of minutes later, he purchases a five-foot aluminum dual platform ladder. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2805.9s)]
*  That's the only time we see the ladder, by the way, Tucker, in this timeline. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2811.1s)]
*  The ladder disappears after this. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2813.38s)]
*  9.42, he leaves. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2815.62s)]
*  They identify him. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2817.82s)]
*  10.30, snipers are in position. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2818.82s)]
*  And this is interesting. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2820.7s)]
*  So that morning, Crooks buys the ladder. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2822.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2825.06s)]
*  So that suggests he's already figured out exactly what he's going to do. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2826.06s)]
*  He's got an idea. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2830.14s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2831.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2832.14s)]
*  So the ladder's in place. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2833.14s)]
*  10.30 a.m., two local law enforcement snipers are in position on the second floor inside [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2835.14s)]
*  the AGR building, the American Glass Research Building. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2839.8599999999997s)]
*  So they don't go to the roof of this building. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2842.74s)]
*  They go inside the second floor. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2846.5s)]
*  They sit there. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2847.8199999999997s)]
*  They're looking out the windows, but they never actually go to the roof or apparently [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2848.94s)]
*  to the back of the building to see where this guy came up. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2852.26s)]
*  5.10 p.m., Crooks is first observed by one of the snipers, AGR Sniper One, at the AGR [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2855.06s)]
*  building. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2862.54s)]
*  And he takes the picture below of Crooks. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2863.54s)]
*  Not long after that, and I'll show you these in a second, they can put up, AGR Sniper One [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2866.54s)]
*  takes a picture below of a bicycle and what appears to be two bags located near the AGR [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2871.06s)]
*  building. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2876.06s)]
*  It is unclear what happened to the bicycle and bags after July 13th, 2024. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2877.2999999999997s)]
*  And take a look at that. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2883.34s)]
*  So they're saying that Crooks rode a bicycle to the event? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2884.58s)]
*  There's a van that's later found outside the event in sort of the parking area that's about [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2892.14s)]
*  a mile distance from this AGR building. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2899.74s)]
*  That is Crooks' van. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2903.5s)]
*  That van is, we're told, contains explosives, homemade explosives, and explosives that are [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2905.7000000000003s)]
*  connected to a remote-controlled detonator, which is later found on Crooks' body. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2913.2200000000003s)]
*  So the idea being then, if this bicycle is indeed his, parks the van, gets into the bicycle, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2917.94s)]
*  carries his rifle, slings it on, you can see the bags in the photo, rides the bicycle from [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2925.26s)]
*  where the van is that mile distance to the back of this building. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2930.06s)]
*  Okay, so then I'm getting to the next part. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2933.38s)]
*  I'm sorry to take this from you. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2935.5s)]
*  And actually, I'm just realizing that I don't believe in the senator's timeline that they [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2936.5s)]
*  have the drone. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2943.34s)]
*  What drone? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2944.34s)]
*  Crooks' drone. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2947.58s)]
*  Unless I'm missing it. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2948.58s)]
*  He has a drone too? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2950.6600000000003s)]
*  It's now been reported that he, at some point prior to 5.10, so around 3 in the afternoon [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2954.34s)]
*  or so, when things are still getting prepared, he's there with a drone flying a flight pattern [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2962.06s)]
*  around the area of the Butler Farm grounds. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2967.94s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2973.38s)]
*  You can't, I mean, I just know from living in DC, you can't just operate drones around [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2974.38s)]
*  law enforcement. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2978.7s)]
*  It freaks them out. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2979.7s)]
*  No, or Don Jr. told me, and I think he said in one of his recent interviews, that when [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2980.7s)]
*  his father was at his house for like an event, like a family event and a party, that he wanted [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2985.06s)]
*  to put up one of his drones and the software wouldn't allow the drone to even take off [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2990.9s)]
*  because a Secret Service detail lead was in the vicinity. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2994.82s)]
*  My cousin was getting married in Southern Pennsylvania, which is pretty close to where [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=2998.02s)]
*  Wilmington is, and she wanted to have a drone up at her wedding. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3003.26s)]
*  And because Biden happened to be in Wilmington at that point, she was within that 30 mile [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3006.58s)]
*  radius. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3011.06s)]
*  The photographers come to her and say, hey, we can't do any drones here. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3012.06s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3015.1400000000003s)]
*  And it's also sophisticated. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3016.3s)]
*  So the guy's got, it seems like he's got a van, explosives, a bicycle, a rifle, a drone, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3017.7400000000002s)]
*  a ladder, a drone. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3024.5800000000004s)]
*  A rangefinder. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3026.0600000000004s)]
*  A rangefinder. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3027.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm going to ask you about that in a second. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3028.0600000000004s)]
*  And the guy knew this was coming. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3030.3s)]
*  This wasn't a spur of the moment thing. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3032.6200000000003s)]
*  He's buying the ladder that morning. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3034.26s)]
*  And he's making a shot that everyone is sort of, I know everyone's like, oh, it's not 140 [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3037.78s)]
*  yards, not that far. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3042.42s)]
*  I think it was 140 yards. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3043.42s)]
*  It's a bootcamp shot. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3044.42s)]
*  Yeah, bootcamp shot. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3046.02s)]
*  Still, I don't know. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3047.3s)]
*  I fired that rifle yesterday. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3049.3s)]
*  You know, you kind of have to... [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3052.42s)]
*  With no scope. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3054.06s)]
*  He had no scope? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3055.06s)]
*  No scope. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3056.06s)]
*  Iron rails. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3057.06s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3058.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3059.06s)]
*  He used iron sights to hit someone in the face at 140 yards. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3060.06s)]
*  My take on that and just my assessment was that he knew that because he was blind prone, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3065.1800000000003s)]
*  he knew that a scope or an EOTech or something would present more of a picture to any counter [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3071.38s)]
*  snipers. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3076.82s)]
*  So if you wanted to stay lower, if you wanted to stay more out of sight, and he's using [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3077.82s)]
*  the angle of the building to conceal himself, that you wouldn't want something... [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3082.1s)]
*  Okay, I'm calling bullshit on this whole thing. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3085.98s)]
*  I'm trying not to use swear words. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3087.38s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3088.78s)]
*  This is not plausible. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3089.78s)]
*  This kid's a 20-year-old, much bullied, socially awkward, weird kid who washes out of the rifle [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3091.02s)]
*  team because he can't shoot. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3099.02s)]
*  He's got no social media profile. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3100.3s)]
*  His search history suggests no research into any of this. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3103.46s)]
*  He sounds way too sophisticated. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3108.0600000000004s)]
*  And the videos that they're not talking about are the fact that he appears in this BlackRock [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3110.98s)]
*  ad, and as well as a number of YouTube videos regarding computer programming that he was [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3115.6200000000003s)]
*  in the previous... [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3121.9s)]
*  Okay, so I know that all of your former military... [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3122.9s)]
*  I wasn't even in the Boy Scouts, but I shoot a lot, have all my life, and I just disagree [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3124.7400000000002s)]
*  with respect with all the former special forces and CIA guys and guys like you. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3129.8s)]
*  I think 140 yards with iron sights hitting a man in the face, pretty good shot. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3134.44s)]
*  I'm just saying that. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3138.1200000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3139.1200000000003s)]
*  No one else agrees to boot camp shot, but this guy didn't go to boot camp. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3140.1200000000003s)]
*  And as someone who also didn't go to boot camp, but shoots a lot, 223, a lot, including yesterday, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3142.84s)]
*  I think it's a decent shot. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3147.98s)]
*  I do. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3149.2400000000002s)]
*  It's hitting steel the size of a tea saucer at 140 yards with iron sights. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3151.0s)]
*  That's not... [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3158.68s)]
*  I mean, I could probably do that, but again, I shoot a lot. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3159.68s)]
*  Well, in Tucker, there's another piece... [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3162.6s)]
*  But for a guy who's 20 or so... [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3164.2s)]
*  How much range time do you have? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3165.2s)]
*  Where did he learn that? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3167.08s)]
*  There is some reporting. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3168.48s)]
*  So this was his father's gun. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3170.7999999999997s)]
*  And so after flying the drone, he drives all the way back to Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3172.7599999999998s)]
*  which is a distance of about an hour, both ways. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3177.56s)]
*  So he drives an hour back, says, hey, dad, I'm going to take the gun out. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3180.06s)]
*  And the dad later tells media, at least as of right now, and caveats all this stuff, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3183.8399999999997s)]
*  because we're going off of what we have right now, that the dad says, I thought he was going [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3187.8799999999997s)]
*  to the range. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3192.52s)]
*  So this sounded like that was a regular thing that he did. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3193.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3196.56s)]
*  Then that's, I mean, it's not a crazy long shot, but it's just... [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3197.56s)]
*  But you kind of have to commit a little bit to learning how to operate the rifle if you're [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3200.24s)]
*  going to hit it at 100 yards. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3204.0s)]
*  Listen to this part, because if you want to talk about the shot... [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3205.0s)]
*  So a lot of people think that he was just sitting there prone, waiting for the opportune [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3206.7599999999998s)]
*  moment. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3210.24s)]
*  Trump happens to turn the last moment, that's it. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3211.24s)]
*  That's not what happened. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3213.2599999999998s)]
*  What happened was a couple of these local police officers, and we've gone through the [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3214.46s)]
*  timeline where they take the picture of him, they're radioing the messages back, and Trump's [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3218.1800000000003s)]
*  team, the actual team around Donald Trump, doesn't get any of these messages. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3225.5s)]
*  Because the easiest thing to do would be to say, hey, let's check that guy out before [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3231.1400000000003s)]
*  we bring the president out on stage. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3235.46s)]
*  They never relay the message to Trump. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3237.38s)]
*  They never give that to his team, his direct body detail. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3239.6200000000003s)]
*  They never hear about this guy. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3243.5s)]
*  So there's a threat that's identified. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3245.38s)]
*  An hour prior, they're taking photos of him, they're checking on him, they lose sight of [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3247.98s)]
*  him, that's when he goes up on the building, we're told. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3252.86s)]
*  They're calling in saying, hey, there's a guy, he's got a range finder. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3256.34s)]
*  So that's what I want to ask you. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3259.46s)]
*  So will you explain for people who aren't familiar with the device, what's a range finder? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3260.9s)]
*  So a range finder is something that somebody might use in in-sight surveying. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3265.3s)]
*  It might use in laying out a plot of land or a nice barn like this one or something [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3269.18s)]
*  like that. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3276.3399999999997s)]
*  And in deer hunting. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3277.3399999999997s)]
*  Or in hunting. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3278.3399999999997s)]
*  And of course, in a sniper team, a range finder is used by the spotter. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3279.3399999999997s)]
*  So sniper teams are always called that because you've got a spotter and a shooter. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3284.2999999999997s)]
*  So the spotter is the person who's doing the range finding. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3287.22s)]
*  They might be calculating wind. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3289.7799999999997s)]
*  They might be... [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3291.18s)]
*  It shows you the distance away from something you're looking at. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3292.18s)]
*  From whatever it is. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3295.12s)]
*  So you're painting it with a laser and you're saying, this is how far away. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3296.12s)]
*  If you're trying to protect the most controversial political figure in the world at an outdoor [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3298.58s)]
*  rally and someone shows up with a range finder, like you can't even bring... [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3303.66s)]
*  At the RNC, you couldn't even bring your jewel and you couldn't even vape. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3308.34s)]
*  You couldn't have a vape in there, yeah. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3311.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3312.8199999999997s)]
*  Because it might increase your testosterone and that's a threat. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3313.8199999999997s)]
*  How do you get a range finder into a protected event? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3317.34s)]
*  That's like the craziest thing I've ever heard. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3320.1s)]
*  So he never goes in through the magnetometers, as far as you know. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3321.84s)]
*  There was reporting early on that the range finder was found in the magnetometers, but [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3325.58s)]
*  the current reporting, caveat, caveat, caveat, is that he always stayed outside the effective [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3330.38s)]
*  secret service perimeter. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3338.02s)]
*  That there's this whole range of fencing. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3339.46s)]
*  By the way, for the record, I'm not saying anything about what I think right now. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3342.7s)]
*  This is the official strain. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3345.9s)]
*  So there's this whole setup off to the side of where Trump is standing, where there's [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3348.46s)]
*  a fence and there's nothing. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3353.14s)]
*  There's no secret service. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3355.8199999999997s)]
*  There's a couple of patrols. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3357.5s)]
*  There's these guys in the building. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3358.5s)]
*  Anybody could have walked up with anything. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3361.08s)]
*  How does the kid know where that unprotected area is? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3362.08s)]
*  So he's casing the area. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3365.02s)]
*  He's going there prior. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3366.68s)]
*  He's flying the drone. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3368.2799999999997s)]
*  He's checking it all out. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3369.66s)]
*  But for whatever reason, he just knows to ride the bike directly there and then he's [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3371.18s)]
*  going to have a direct shot from the top. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3376.1s)]
*  This kid doesn't have a job. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3377.5s)]
*  I mean, he's 20 years old. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3378.5s)]
*  He works at a nursing home. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3379.5s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3380.98s)]
*  That's right. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3381.98s)]
*  Very, very tactically. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3383.82s)]
*  No, but that's right. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3384.82s)]
*  He's changing bedpans by day, but he somehow is able to assess exactly the place that's [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3385.82s)]
*  got the height advantage, this building, and that is unprotected. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3393.62s)]
*  How would he know? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3397.8s)]
*  I mean, the luck involved is extraordinary. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3398.8s)]
*  It's more than just that. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3400.7400000000002s)]
*  There's luck because we're also told, and again, this timeline doesn't quite have it, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3401.7400000000002s)]
*  that at one point the police do, the local police, the Butler police do go out and they [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3407.74s)]
*  send a couple of units to go, a couple of guys over to go and say, Hey, there's, we [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3412.9799999999996s)]
*  think there's someone on that roof. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3417.02s)]
*  We're not sure why they snipe her team inside the building. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3419.4199999999996s)]
*  Doesn't just go and check the roof of their own building. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3422.7s)]
*  But some guys who are on the ground, one officer hoist the other officer on his shoulders. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3424.5s)]
*  So we can, it's not that high of a building. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3430.2999999999997s)]
*  So they, Hey, take a look up there. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3431.8599999999997s)]
*  And they, they couldn't find any ladder from their vantage point. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3433.5s)]
*  They go up there. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3437.06s)]
*  Officer sees Crooks. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3438.56s)]
*  Crooks turns, trains the rifle directly at the officer. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3440.42s)]
*  Officer ducks down and we're told that again, based off of this officer's reporting that [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3444.2599999999998s)]
*  at that moment, Crooks swings the rifle back around and begins firing a trump. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3448.9s)]
*  So this wasn't a situation where he was sitting there lying in wait, totally unintercepted [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3454.84s)]
*  and fires the shots. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3460.02s)]
*  We're told that those shots ring out within seconds of him switching his sight picture [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3461.18s)]
*  back and forth from the officer back to Trump. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3465.62s)]
*  So I think again, as a non-expert, but a lifelong shooter, I think that's a pretty adult shot. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3467.7s)]
*  Do you, I mean, you, you're in the military. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3474.46s)]
*  Being able to, to switch the sight picture that far at that range, maintain your cool [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3478.3399999999997s)]
*  and still get off a shot, which has a little bit of connection to, to the ear is that's [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3483.1s)]
*  a fantastic shot. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3488.8599999999997s)]
*  It is right. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3489.8599999999997s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3490.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm glad someone said that. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3491.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, they're all, everyone on television has like been in Delta Force or something, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3493.1s)]
*  and they're all crazy accomplished shooters. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3496.5s)]
*  But for a non-veteran with no law enforcement background to make a shot like that strikes [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3498.54s)]
*  me as pretty amazing. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3504.58s)]
*  The one thing that I would just add though, is that in, in, in military, and I wasn't [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3507.06s)]
*  like some sniper or anything, but very basic level of training and you know, some, some [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3511.5s)]
*  mountain training and stuff like that, that you're not trained to go for headshots. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3517.46s)]
*  You're trained to aim center mass. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3521.42s)]
*  And that's any basic firearms course is going to drain you center mass, center mass. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3523.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3527.5800000000004s)]
*  Because the head's turned. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3528.5800000000004s)]
*  So, you know, the head turns, you know, the head moves around. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3529.5800000000004s)]
*  That being said, it's a smaller target, center mass. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3531.98s)]
*  You've got your central nervous system. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3534.82s)]
*  So you've got, you've got the brain stem, you've got your spinal column, you've got [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3536.3s)]
*  lungs, you've got heart, you've got all sorts of important real estate right here. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3540.1800000000003s)]
*  So as long as you're somewhere along that parallel axis, you're going to more than likely [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3543.6200000000003s)]
*  hit something and you've got, you've got more of a sight picture. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3547.94s)]
*  You've got target rich environment if you're going for center mass. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3550.58s)]
*  And to this point, we don't, I have not seen reporting of whether or not Trump was actually [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3555.18s)]
*  wearing a bulletproof vest that day. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3559.34s)]
*  I don't think he was. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3561.06s)]
*  He was not shot in the chest, by the way. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3563.38s)]
*  There was early speculation that he was. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3566.14s)]
*  I asked him directly. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3568.18s)]
*  He said he wasn't. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3569.18s)]
*  Well, that was something with Reagan too, because Reagan does get hit. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3570.18s)]
*  And at first they thought it wasn't that bad, but later it turned out there was internal [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3573.38s)]
*  bleeding and there was other stuff that was going on. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3575.94s)]
*  So how, from the video we have all seen, the counter sniper, secret service counter sniper [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3577.86s)]
*  is lying prone and he clearly has the shooter in his, in his glasses. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3583.3s)]
*  He's looking at him. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3589.1400000000003s)]
*  He does not shoot the sniper until after the sniper has shot Trump. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3590.86s)]
*  How could a secret service counter sniper look at a man with a rifle 140 yards away and not [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3596.3s)]
*  shoot him? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3604.34s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3605.34s)]
*  So two schools of thought. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3606.74s)]
*  One option is he thought it was a police officer. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3608.62s)]
*  Because remember the local police are supposed to have control of this building and they [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3612.2999999999997s)]
*  don't have any communications with local police. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3616.8199999999997s)]
*  And there have been so many times Tucker at events where someone from one agency, because [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3619.06s)]
*  they're dealing with these augments, they're dealing with people from a, there's a ton [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3623.74s)]
*  of HSI from Homeland security that are there. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3626.4599999999996s)]
*  There's a ton of these other local agencies. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3629.18s)]
*  You've got multiple agencies going around, which even worse at the RNC, but I think there [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3630.58s)]
*  was like 130 different agencies that were at the RNC represented. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3634.42s)]
*  So if you don't have good communications because you didn't go to the meeting, then you have [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3637.7000000000003s)]
*  no way of knowing, Hey guys, do you have someone on that building or not? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3642.62s)]
*  Because I see someone with a rifle doesn't look like a police officer and he's aiming [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3646.3s)]
*  his rifle at the president. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3651.1800000000003s)]
*  So the question Tucker though is, if you know that, if you know that at that point, why [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3653.8s)]
*  first call to your detail sitting right with the president and say, hold him. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3660.02s)]
*  Don't let him go on that stage. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3666.1800000000003s)]
*  There's a guy with a rifle pointed at the stage. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3667.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3669.54s)]
*  Which, which by the way, I mean, we've all been at Trump events or whatever, politician [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3670.54s)]
*  events where they show up a couple of minutes late. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3673.7000000000003s)]
*  It's never been a place to take pictures. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3675.7400000000002s)]
*  They're talking to somebody, whatever. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3677.7000000000003s)]
*  So who are these? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3679.66s)]
*  I mean, have we heard from the counter sniper team? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3680.9s)]
*  Secret service? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3683.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3685.5s)]
*  No. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3686.5s)]
*  Increasingly defined by deception and the total rejection of human dignity, we decided [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3687.5s)]
*  to found the Tucker Carlson network and we did it with one principle in mind. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3692.46s)]
*  Tell the truth. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3697.38s)]
*  You have a God given right to think for yourself. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3698.38s)]
*  Our work is made possible by our members. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3702.52s)]
*  So if you want to enjoy an ad free experience and keep this going, join TCN at Tucker Carlson [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3705.18s)]
*  dot com slash podcast, Tucker Carlson dot com slash podcast. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3710.94s)]
*  So was, was Senator Johnson able to interview them? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3716.58s)]
*  No. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3719.94s)]
*  It's all been Kimberly Cheadle, go to, go to the spokesman. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3721.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm looking through the report again here to see if anything, there's lots of questions, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3727.9s)]
*  lots of outstanding questions that the Senator's written here. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3731.18s)]
*  So this is, if I can just say, this is the point where the secret service is incumbent [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3733.7799999999997s)]
*  on them to prove that they didn't allow this kid to shoot Trump because it certainly looks [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3738.58s)]
*  like they did allow it. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3743.56s)]
*  So I don't understand where, you know, why there isn't a delegation of senators and members [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3745.9s)]
*  of Congress and citizens standing outside blocking the entrance to the secret service [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3752.28s)]
*  headquarters to find, you know, answer the question. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3756.5s)]
*  You are, I think based on everything you've said, they are presumed guilty. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3759.78s)]
*  Now they may not be guilty, but they have an obligation to explain how they're not [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3763.6200000000003s)]
*  guilty and no one is forcing that explanation. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3768.06s)]
*  Like what is going on? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3770.7400000000002s)]
*  So Tucker, here's an interesting thing when you look at government. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3773.58s)]
*  So in, in criminal justice, you have the presumption of innocence. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3776.7s)]
*  So the, the government has the presumption, the evidence must be on their side. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3780.62s)]
*  So they, they have to bring the evidence. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3785.14s)]
*  The burden of proof is on the government because the government is bringing the accusations. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3787.02s)]
*  I say when it's the government, it's the opposite. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3791.18s)]
*  I would say the burden of innocence is on the citizens and the burden of guilt is on [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3793.88s)]
*  them. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3801.38s)]
*  This fact set, common sense suggests like this is screw up after screw up after screw [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3802.58s)]
*  up, which put together suggest an intentional series of screw ups, which would have allowed [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3807.58s)]
*  Trump to be murdered and you know, whatever else would happen after that. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3814.26s)]
*  So like the fact that they haven't explained themselves and haven't been forced to explain [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3818.1400000000003s)]
*  them. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3821.58s)]
*  And I mean, forced to explain themselves tells you that things are totally out of control. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3822.58s)]
*  So as we record, they can do anything and nobody can do anything about it. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3825.86s)]
*  So as we're recording this, Kimberly Cheadle is supposedly testifying in, in front of Comers [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3829.54s)]
*  right now. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3835.02s)]
*  And that being said, well, caveat, caveat, there might be something that comes out of [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3836.46s)]
*  that. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3840.2599999999998s)]
*  The house has started to look into this, but I think without question and something that [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3841.2599999999998s)]
*  speaker Johnson has spoken of, which I certainly agree with is that this needs to be investigated. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3843.96s)]
*  You can't murder people. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3850.42s)]
*  The house needs to set up a commission that's 10 times bigger than whatever the J six commission [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3851.58s)]
*  was. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3857.7s)]
*  And we need to get absolutely to the bottom of any of this because when you talk about [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3859.2599999999998s)]
*  crooks, not about crooks for a little bit. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3865.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3867.8999999999996s)]
*  And I keep this guy wrecking the flow of your, of your story here. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3868.8999999999996s)]
*  They say that this guy was a total ghost on social media. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3871.74s)]
*  It's not a ghost on social media when he's 20 years old. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3876.4199999999996s)]
*  That means he's making himself a ghost that he's got. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3878.74s)]
*  He's got programming knowledge. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3881.7799999999997s)]
*  He knows how to use encrypted accounts. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3883.2599999999998s)]
*  No, he knows how to hide what he's doing online. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3884.7s)]
*  He knows how to use VPNs. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3887.9s)]
*  He knows how to use tour. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3888.9s)]
*  He knows all of that stuff, tour browser. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3889.98s)]
*  And so he's able to mask what he's doing online now. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3892.06s)]
*  And again, hypothetical, all hypothetical, but the question is, how did he know all of [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3896.7400000000002s)]
*  this information? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3900.9s)]
*  How did he know this? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3901.94s)]
*  Did he know that there would be a low security posture at this event? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3903.34s)]
*  Did he know that, um, that the secret service would be split between multiple events? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3907.14s)]
*  I don't think everyone, anyone was really tracking that from the outside that, Hey, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3913.06s)]
*  Bill Biden's got an event here and Donald Trump's got an event here and the RNC is right [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3916.26s)]
*  here. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3919.6600000000003s)]
*  So secret service doesn't have. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3920.6600000000003s)]
*  What's his, but I missed the most obvious question, which is what's the kid's motive? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3922.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, Tucker, it's, it's one of those, one of those great times where the [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3926.3s)]
*  government is telling us authorities are baffled as to what the motive might be. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3930.26s)]
*  Well, I thought they were telling us that Iran did it or Assad did it. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3934.7400000000002s)]
*  Then a few days, he's going to gas Trump with his poison gas reserves. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3939.3s)]
*  Within a few days after we get this story about, uh, right. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3942.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, it was Iran when he's winning the war. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3947.06s)]
*  Ron did it. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3949.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3950.46s)]
*  And so we're told it was Iran. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3951.46s)]
*  But that being said, the Iranian, that stuff goes back to Soleimani. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3952.46s)]
*  That stuff is like some old, you know, we're going to get you back. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3955.2999999999997s)]
*  It's also manipulated from this. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3957.8999999999996s)]
*  And it's interesting that the first country that we get told may have had a role in this [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3960.14s)]
*  is exactly the same country that the Leviathan and the oligarchs and the neocons want to [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3965.74s)]
*  go to war with. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3970.58s)]
*  No, it's also transparently fake. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3971.98s)]
*  But like, what's has anyone, like, why would a kid die to kill Trump? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3973.42s)]
*  Like, what is his, what do we know about? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3979.94s)]
*  Do we know anything about the guy? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3981.38s)]
*  What do his parents say? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3982.38s)]
*  I mean, what is this? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3983.62s)]
*  So father, there's a news vacuum around the most dramatic thing that's happened in the [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3984.62s)]
*  past 20 years in the United States. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3988.58s)]
*  Tucker, think about how, how this, how CNN or regime media would go after a J six family, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3990.34s)]
*  right? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3996.22s)]
*  They would go after it. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3997.22s)]
*  They've got, they've got the cousins, they've got the sister, they've got the brother, they're [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=3998.22s)]
*  knocking on doors. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4000.9s)]
*  They're talking to everyone who's ever met that person. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4002.14s)]
*  They know you're, you're grosser. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4004.26s)]
*  They know the guy who works at your, on this case, sheets. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4005.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, they're talking to every single person who may have come in contact you with [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4008.46s)]
*  this. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4011.3s)]
*  Got a couple of interviews. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4012.3s)]
*  So we don't know what his motive was. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4013.3s)]
*  Of kids. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4014.3s)]
*  They're not putting out any motive. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4015.3s)]
*  The most they're saying is that they found on his phone photographs of Trump, photographs [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4016.3s)]
*  of Biden, searches for the RNC, searches for the DNC, searches for pornography, by the [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4020.1s)]
*  way. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4024.98s)]
*  One of his final searches on the day of that wasn't in the timeline, but we're told that [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4025.98s)]
*  on the day of he was searching pornography and I think that's about it. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4029.7s)]
*  That's all we're getting. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4038.3399999999997s)]
*  Is there evidence that there was more than one shooter? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4039.3399999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of questions. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4042.1s)]
*  The there are some photos floating around very heavily pixelated of something on top [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4043.94s)]
*  of a water tower that we have no idea what that is. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4051.58s)]
*  It appears to be in some of the photos and some not. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4056.18s)]
*  Couldn't tell you what that is. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4058.9s)]
*  There's also some pretty compelling evidence that shows the sight lines from where he was [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4060.14s)]
*  on top of this AGR building. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4064.78s)]
*  And then keep in mind, by the way, we haven't mentioned it, but the people actually died [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4067.02s)]
*  at this. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4069.9s)]
*  So Corey Campatore, this firefighter actually was killed. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4070.9s)]
*  So I know there's this like left-wing theory that, you know, it was all staged and it was [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4073.54s)]
*  all fake, but someone did actually die. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4077.06s)]
*  This wasn't a situation where, you know, Trump is calling him up saying, you know, Tommy, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4079.38s)]
*  you know, I know you're the best sniper in the world. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4085.1800000000003s)]
*  So just just the year, Tommy. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4087.5s)]
*  Just the no, it's ridiculous when you actually it's my favorite conspiracy theory about all [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4089.42s)]
*  of it. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4092.66s)]
*  But in terms of in terms of it, it we don't have any evidence of any other snipers shooters [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4093.66s)]
*  at this point, but we also have a striking lack of evidence about this shooter at the [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4098.9s)]
*  same time. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4102.86s)]
*  So Ron Johnson in in interview yesterday said that there was some as yet unidentified man [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4103.86s)]
*  in a gray suit. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4110.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4111.58s)]
*  Who showed up on the scene as told witnesses to send photographic evidence, pictures and [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4112.58s)]
*  video to him of the body of the body. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4117.58s)]
*  So tell us what we know about this. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4120.78s)]
*  So and this this is spoken to in reports all over the place now. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4122.46s)]
*  But this is spoken to in the report where they're told there's this man in the gray [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4125.46s)]
*  suit and that the man in the gray suit was later identified as somebody what it looks [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4130.22s)]
*  like because he had a two one five number. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4133.86s)]
*  That's the Philadelphia area code familiar because everyone I grew up with had a two [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4135.34s)]
*  one five or six on area code that stated to be from the ATF's Philadelphia office. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4138.9400000000005s)]
*  They requested the photos of crooks for facial recognition purposes. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4145.82s)]
*  It's more of an FBI thing, but OK. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4150.34s)]
*  The staff called the phone number confirmed that it was associated with the ATF. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4152.58s)]
*  However, in subsequent attempts to establish further talks with the individual at that [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4156.66s)]
*  number, Senator Johnson's staff received the following email and it's you know, it's [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4160.98s)]
*  just total boilerplate. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4165.7s)]
*  You know, direct all of your questions to our main office, our main spokesman. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4167.0599999999995s)]
*  This is an ongoing investigation. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4170.78s)]
*  We'd like to coordinate our request, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4172.54s)]
*  So this guy's gone totally dark. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4174.9s)]
*  Whoever this man in the gray suit was, who happened to be probably one of these [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4176.38s)]
*  augments from the ATF office, he's sent out there at the same time that apparently [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4180.139999999999s)]
*  we can't get any extra secret service. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4185.0199999999995s)]
*  We can't get anyone from all the other offices. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4187.0599999999995s)]
*  You're relying on local police to secure, obviously, the most opportune building to [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4188.78s)]
*  connect an assassination shot from President Trump that's completely unguarded [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4194.58s)]
*  from the roof, has nobody on it. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4200.179999999999s)]
*  Nobody thinks to put anybody on it. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4202.26s)]
*  Like, I mean, I don't know about you, Tucker, but when I go to these events, every time [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4203.74s)]
*  that I've gone to a presidential event, I'm thinking, especially if it's outdoors, I'm [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4206.9s)]
*  thinking that building, that building, that building, that building, this thing over [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4209.5s)]
*  here, this is by the way, when you see the, you know, when they hang the flags from [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4212.78s)]
*  cranes and stuff like that, or they might have some farm equipment up or the, you [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4216.82s)]
*  know, the fracking wells that were used in the Butler, the Butler rally from 2020, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4221.58s)]
*  by the way, those are meant to be security implements. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4225.38s)]
*  In addition to decorative, they are also used for concealment of [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4228.78s)]
*  potential snipers. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4233.58s)]
*  So, OK, you've got a guy who could be on this building. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4234.3s)]
*  Great. Put a flag in front of it. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4236.94s)]
*  So now you can't see. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4237.9800000000005s)]
*  So now that building is, it's not completely protected, but it's at least less of a [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4238.94s)]
*  threat than it could be. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4242.78s)]
*  This building from there to the stage, nothing. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4243.78s)]
*  What makes me feel that things are completely out of control in this country is [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4247.34s)]
*  eight days later, nine days later, we still can't answer the most basic questions [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4252.34s)]
*  about any of this. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4256.5s)]
*  And the people who are in charge of protecting Donald Trump's life have not [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4258.1s)]
*  answered the questions. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4263.5s)]
*  They haven't been held to account. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4264.38s)]
*  Pretty obviously never will be. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4265.5s)]
*  It does feel like there's no recourse. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4267.46s)]
*  Like they can just murder a guy or allow his murder and the rest of staff sit there [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4270.5s)]
*  and be like, yeah, that's kind of how it goes. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4274.86s)]
*  Like that's not the country you want to live in at all. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4276.54s)]
*  That's not the country it was five years ago. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4279.42s)]
*  What is this? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4281.22s)]
*  We've held one FBI briefing. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4281.86s)]
*  You had one FBI briefing, like the day of explaining what happened. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4283.74s)]
*  Where are the daily briefings? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4288.7s)]
*  All right. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4290.26s)]
*  When there's, when there's a fire in downtown, whatever city, inner city, you're [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4290.38s)]
*  getting at least two, three briefings. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4295.3s)]
*  Maybe what happened? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4297.26s)]
*  A fire or a mass shooting this. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4298.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4299.86s)]
*  Where's the day two briefing? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4300.1s)]
*  Where's the day three briefing? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4301.26s)]
*  Where's the, okay. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4302.62s)]
*  We brought the parents in for questioning. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4304.38s)]
*  All by the way, one of the, oh, I left this out. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4305.9800000000005s)]
*  One of the things that he was searching, Ethan Crumbly. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4308.1s)]
*  You remember Ethan Crumbly? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4311.58s)]
*  No. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4312.74s)]
*  Ethan Crumbly was the school shooter where his parents later got charged [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4313.42s)]
*  for giving him access to the gun. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4318.06s)]
*  So in this situation, his parents also gave him access to the gun. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4320.58s)]
*  He may have been looking up whether or not his parents would get charged for [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4325.1s)]
*  what he was about to do and on his steam account, the video game online platform. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4329.46s)]
*  He posted July 13th will be my premiere. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4334.62s)]
*  Do we have any indication of what drugs he may have been on? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4338.26s)]
*  So at this point, no total radio silence. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4343.9400000000005s)]
*  However, both of his parents were behavioral counselors licensed. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4347.74s)]
*  So certainly people who would have access to all the finest SSRIs, antidepressants. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4352.18s)]
*  So there does seem to be a connection. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4357.58s)]
*  And there were some searches found on him from, for major depressive disorder, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4358.900000000001s)]
*  for major depressive disorder, which is an actual set phrase. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4364.58s)]
*  That's not just, I'm looking up about like the average person might say, Hey, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4368.9s)]
*  I think I'm depressed. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4372.82s)]
*  What are the signs of depression? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4373.82s)]
*  What are the symptoms of depression? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4374.9s)]
*  But someone who knows that set phrase, phrase, major depressive disorder, like, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4376.26s)]
*  Oh, I don't know if your parents were both behavioral counselors who had access to, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4380.22s)]
*  to doctors, access to these types of medications. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4383.94s)]
*  You might know to use that phrase. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4386.54s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4389.42s)]
*  What do you think happened? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4390.3s)]
*  You know, Tucker, there's, there's one thing to go off the evidence, right? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4394.62s)]
*  And there's one thing to go and sit there and say, okay, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4397.7s)]
*  this is all the evidence we have. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4399.74s)]
*  Not none of this adds up. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4401.66s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4403.34s)]
*  I've never heard of anything like this about someone. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4404.42s)]
*  It sounds ludicrous to me. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4407.46s)]
*  So the guy rides up with a bicycle and the bicycle and look at the picture. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4408.82s)]
*  It's just a regular rifle bag sitting there on the bicycle. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4413.0199999999995s)]
*  Anyone who's shot a gun ever could look at that and say, well, yeah, you know, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4415.7s)]
*  that's what that is. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4420.06s)]
*  There's a black gun in there. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4420.7s)]
*  You know, and, and, oh, by the way, you know, nobody else is [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4421.5s)]
*  riding bicycles around here with backpacks, flying a drone with a range [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4424.22s)]
*  finder. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4427.740000000001s)]
*  It's like, what else did this guy need? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4428.26s)]
*  You know, a big sign that says I am the sniper and pointing it down at him. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4429.7s)]
*  It's like, and they see him an hour before an hour, an hour before half hour [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4433.02s)]
*  before 15 minutes before 10 minutes prior before Trump comes out. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4436.58s)]
*  Six 11, by the way, is when the, uh, when the bolts are fired. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4439.62s)]
*  And so then we're told this is key. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4442.820000000001s)]
*  And actually I'm setting all that stuff aside because that's not actually where [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4446.860000000001s)]
*  I'm focused on, on what I want to know more about. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4451.02s)]
*  I want to know more about these explosives. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4453.379999999999s)]
*  Why haven't we seen any pictures of the explosives? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4456.179999999999s)]
*  Why haven't we seen or even heard any information about how sophisticated were [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4458.7s)]
*  these things were told they were remote control detonated because they said they [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4463.82s)]
*  have a detonator. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4467.259999999999s)]
*  We've seen pictures of the detonator also provided by local police, by the way, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4467.82s)]
*  not the federal enforcement. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4471.0599999999995s)]
*  So if this kid knew enough to build remote control bombs, you really think that [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4472.54s)]
*  he's just doing that one time. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4477.299999999999s)]
*  You think that's just the first day that he always built some bombs this morning [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4478.78s)]
*  and drive down to the Trump rally. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4482.02s)]
*  No, no, this is something that he had been planning. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4483.620000000001s)]
*  This is something that he had been in preparation for. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4485.9400000000005s)]
*  This is something by the way, when typically we see, especially when we know [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4488.46s)]
*  if he's using encrypted accounts, if he's using, if he's using, uh, uh, the [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4492.660000000001s)]
*  internet in the way that he's able to, at that level, that perhaps he's in [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4497.34s)]
*  communication with somebody through those accounts, perhaps people who know [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4501.14s)]
*  how to build bombs, we don't know. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4504.540000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4506.5s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4506.660000000001s)]
*  My question is, I want to see the level of sophistication on these bombs and I [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4507.22s)]
*  want to see if this is something that he was able to actually pull off on his own [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4511.42s)]
*  because we don't have answers about the pipe, the pipe bomber from Jan six, by [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4515.86s)]
*  the way, the pipe bomber who, oh, by the way, was directly connected to someone [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4519.06s)]
*  who never acknowledges it. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4522.74s)]
*  What was her name again? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4523.82s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4524.54s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4524.82s)]
*  So the pipe bomb was found directly outside the DNC. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4526.1s)]
*  Kamala Harris is inside her secret service detail. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4529.22s)]
*  Again, secret service is right outside is informed of the pipe bomber the same [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4531.42s)]
*  way this secret service was informed of the sniper and yet doesn't respond. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4536.98s)]
*  And we have them in video Darren video, Darren BD and revolver have the great [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4542.139999999999s)]
*  video of this, where the secret service is just letting people walk around in [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4544.66s)]
*  front of this pipe bomb and Kamala Harris is inside it yet she has never publicly [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4548.82s)]
*  acknowledged the surreal pipe bombs threat to her life, right? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4552.339999999999s)]
*  Why is, why aren't we hearing that? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4556.86s)]
*  Why are we here? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4558.299999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris, uh, nominated to be president after surviving an assassination [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4558.98s)]
*  attempt on her life on January six. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4562.66s)]
*  Why have you never heard that phrase from the media? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4564.419999999999s)]
*  Not one time. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4566.219999999999s)]
*  Not one. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4566.9s)]
*  Why wouldn't you? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4567.219999999999s)]
*  Cause it's fake. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4567.86s)]
*  Cause it's totally fake. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4568.62s)]
*  And so again, we have another situation where explosives are involved. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4569.78s)]
*  There's the shady ATF, maybe agent in a grant in a gray suit. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4573.299999999999s)]
*  The secret service is involved. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4577.179999999999s)]
*  Uh, Kamala Harris is like tangentially involved because she's the one who [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4578.7s)]
*  somehow seems to be the beneficiary of all of this, all of these things. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4582.46s)]
*  Um, at least in, in the current moment. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4585.98s)]
*  And we're also told by the way, explosives at the house. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4588.58s)]
*  So like, like what kid is like, I've got kids, they're not that they're not 20, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4592.58s)]
*  but my kids are making bombs. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4596.1s)]
*  I I'm going to know about that. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4597.900000000001s)]
*  Like I'm going to say, Hey, what are you working on son? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4599.18s)]
*  You making some bombs, you know, am I going to, am I going to show them a [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4602.3s)]
*  better way to run that circuit? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4606.3s)]
*  No. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4607.860000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm going to say, Hey, don't do this. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4608.620000000001s)]
*  Like this is what's going to put you on a list. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4610.5s)]
*  So are you suggesting you think the Biden administration, which was [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4612.06s)]
*  responsible for Trump's security allowed this to happen? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4617.42s)]
*  It's not outside the realm of possibility. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4624.02s)]
*  It's just not. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4627.1s)]
*  And I think, and I think as, uh, I wouldn't necessarily say it was [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4627.700000000001s)]
*  Biden's call though. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4631.18s)]
*  That's the part that I might have hesitation on. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4632.54s)]
*  I mean, one of the weird quirks of our system is especially now. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4635.26s)]
*  The Biden administration is the name, but that's not actually the first. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4639.06s)]
*  Of course, but Donald Trump is running to displace, you know, the democratic [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4641.54s)]
*  party from its position of power, but the party controls his security. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4646.54s)]
*  Let's say you knew. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4649.9800000000005s)]
*  Let's say. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4651.18s)]
*  That's very weird. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4651.58s)]
*  Let's say you knew that security posture wouldn't be doing well back then. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4654.620000000001s)]
*  Let's say you knew that, um, that secret service was stretched. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4657.740000000001s)]
*  Then let's say you knew, for example, that Trump's normal team wasn't around him. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4660.820000000001s)]
*  The people that are used to the type of threats that come around with Donald [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4664.34s)]
*  Trump is in, is in town and holding a rally. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4666.780000000001s)]
*  And let's say you also, and keep in mind that when you're talking about FBI, we [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4669.42s)]
*  didn't talk about loners like this. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4672.860000000001s)]
*  Um, you know, my, I'll just say this, my mind keeps going back to [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4674.34s)]
*  the Garland Texas shooting. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4678.42s)]
*  So you might remember this. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4679.860000000001s)]
*  They, they, it was like Pamela Geller and they did very well. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4681.1s)]
*  Draw the draw. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4683.62s)]
*  Muhammad actually knows some people who were there, um, that very well. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4684.54s)]
*  People who were there that was then later attacked by a couple of these, like a [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4689.3s)]
*  couple of these local, locally trained, locally home, homegrown domestic terrorists [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4693.42s)]
*  who were supposedly in support of ISIS at the time. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4698.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, we know that there were two guys who opened fire and that the two guys, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4702.46s)]
*  uh, were both shot and killed. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4707.42s)]
*  And we know that, um, and they were killed before anyone was, everyone [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4708.82s)]
*  else was able to killed inside the Garland Texas 2015. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4711.66s)]
*  But did you know about the FBI guy in the car behind them? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4715.58s)]
*  Directing the whole thing. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4719.7s)]
*  That had texted tear up Texas, that this entire thing Elton Simpson, and this came [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4721.58s)]
*  out by the way, because they had a third friend who was later charged with like [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4727.7s)]
*  financing all of this, that his lawyer uncovers text messages and communications [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4731.54s)]
*  and discovery about an FBI employee, as well as multiple informants that are all [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4737.7s)]
*  involved with this mosque that they're attending in the Phoenix area. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4744.42s)]
*  And one of the agents or one of the, one of the employees has paid like [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4747.86s)]
*  a hundred 32,000 dollars over the course of years to befriend these guys and to [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4750.82s)]
*  push them in this direction of radicalization. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4756.5s)]
*  And then we're told that, and all of this comes out in, in the lawsuit, by the way, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4758.82s)]
*  completely thrown out based on standing grounds, sovereign immunity, that not [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4763.26s)]
*  only, I think about it for years, we're told that these are just a couple of [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4767.62s)]
*  nut jobs trying to shoot up a, uh, you know, conservative Muslim, Muhammad [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4771.5s)]
*  event, whatever, that not only is there an FBI guy talking to them and the [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4776.38s)]
*  intercept, by the way, used to report on things like this. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4782.740000000001s)]
*  And he's saying tear up Texas. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4785.22s)]
*  He's inciting them to violence, knows that they're going to the event and is [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4787.740000000001s)]
*  sitting in the car behind him, behind the two of them, when they open the [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4792.34s)]
*  initial photo that was reported by local law enforcement, uh, of the event was [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4797.46s)]
*  taken by the FBI asset who was sitting in the car. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4803.62s)]
*  That's how we, that's how we was able to get the photo. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4806.82s)]
*  Cause he was right there. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4808.3s)]
*  You know, wow, what a great shot, you know, a photographer at the Trump rally, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4808.9800000000005s)]
*  of course, well, the New York times was there. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4812.62s)]
*  And, you know, obviously that's at the beginning of the rally. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4813.9800000000005s)]
*  That's when the photographers always come in. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4817.22s)]
*  And then they're usually the photographers leave after a couple of minutes. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4818.74s)]
*  There's like the set period when they come in and then the lead from that [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4821.22s)]
*  directly under the ground shot. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4824.14s)]
*  Kind of interesting that that's when the shots were fired, but you know, let's, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4827.26s)]
*  you know, let's leave that aside that he was sitting in the car behind the [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4830.14s)]
*  garland Texans shooters when it took place. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4835.54s)]
*  When that happened, Tucker, he fled. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4838.26s)]
*  He was actually stopped by local police and arrested. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4840.900000000001s)]
*  They said, why are you playing the scene? [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4842.54s)]
*  And he said, well, I saw a shooting. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4844.14s)]
*  I didn't know he was, he was put in handcuffs at one point later came up years later. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4845.06s)]
*  This guy was an FBI asset. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4849.740000000001s)]
*  He'd been talking to him the entire time. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4850.98s)]
*  Comey wiped the entire thing under the rug. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4852.62s)]
*  So there's, there's precedent for this. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4857.139999999999s)]
*  And I think January 6th is the perfect example. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4859.299999999999s)]
*  We've never gotten accounting of how many federal agents were in the crowd, but an [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4862.82s)]
*  enormous number, way disproportionate to any other event I've ever heard of in [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4866.0599999999995s)]
*  Washington. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4870.259999999999s)]
*  And it was to some extent organic, to some extent it was a setup. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4871.82s)]
*  That's my, uh, sincere and pretty well-informed opinion of that. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4876.179999999999s)]
*  So like, it's not, this is kind of thing has happened before. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4880.66s)]
*  One of the questions that I would add to the senators list here, and it's a good [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4884.26s)]
*  list and they've done great work, but one of the questions that I would add that I [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4888.3s)]
*  don't see, so we keep getting told there were sniper teams, there were [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4891.099999999999s)]
*  counter sniper teams, local law enforcement, chair, blah, blah, blah, the [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4893.62s)]
*  whole list. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4896.18s)]
*  But then we're told that there was an ATF agent who shows up in a gray suit with [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4897.38s)]
*  no credentials, no credentials. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4902.18s)]
*  Oh, so you mean like he wasn't in uniform. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4904.98s)]
*  You mean like he wasn't wearing a, you know, the blue jacket with the yellow [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4907.5s)]
*  lettering that we've all seen that says ATF. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4910.34s)]
*  So does that mean he was playing close? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4913.1s)]
*  So does that mean he was in fact undercover? [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4915.1s)]
*  So if this guy was there playing close as federal law enforcement, how many [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4917.7s)]
*  potential other law enforcement types did they have in the crowd that day at Butler? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4923.18s)]
*  No one's even talking about that yet. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4929.860000000001s)]
*  So that's the main thing that we need to be asking to Chris Ray, to others, was [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4931.58s)]
*  this guy who was conducting all of these searches, who was doing site surveys, who [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4936.3s)]
*  was buying ladders, who was flying a drone overhead. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4940.02s)]
*  Was he on your radar? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4944.580000000001s)]
*  Was he someone that training for an AR-15 training for potentially taking out [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4945.580000000001s)]
*  president? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4950.46s)]
*  Was he on your radar? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4951.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is why we have the FBI, right? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4952.660000000001s)]
*  This is why we have, we pay for all these things and we're told that, oh, well, we [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4954.5s)]
*  need the surveillance data. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4958.740000000001s)]
*  We need the Patriot Act. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4959.46s)]
*  We need all of this because it's keeping us safe and it's keeping Trump safe. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4960.22s)]
*  So you just came from the Republican convention in Milwaukee. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4964.660000000001s)]
*  I didn't hear anybody talking about this, including the former president. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4969.82s)]
*  And I do think, well, I don't know, but my sense is he, you know, he doesn't want [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4974.7s)]
*  to stoke more division than we already have. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4980.379999999999s)]
*  On the other hand, someone who tried to murder him came incredibly close. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4982.42s)]
*  And at very best, the Biden administration allowed that to happen, whether [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4986.86s)]
*  intentionally or not, but they allowed that to happen. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4990.94s)]
*  They didn't have a briefing that morning. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4992.98s)]
*  They didn't, I mean, it was negligent to the point of criminal behavior. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4994.5s)]
*  For me, it comes back to the fact that the two pieces, in addition to the no [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=4998.299999999999s)]
*  briefing, no briefing, the fact that no one was on the roof at any point other [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5003.62s)]
*  than apparently this Thomas Matthew Crooks. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5009.9s)]
*  And then finally, once all law enforcement around the event knew that there was a [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5012.62s)]
*  problem, knew that something had gone wrong and Trump is still backstage. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5018.94s)]
*  I know. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5023.82s)]
*  The first call you make is to his detail and say, hold him. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5024.86s)]
*  Well, right. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5029.94s)]
*  That's the point. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5030.34s)]
*  They allowed this to happen again, maybe unintentionally, maybe very much [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5030.86s)]
*  intentionally, but he's allowed to go on stage, but they allowed it to happen. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5034.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5037.0599999999995s)]
*  So that's just a fact, not contested. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5037.3s)]
*  And yet even Republicans are like, maybe it's too much for the American mind to [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5042.099999999999s)]
*  digest. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5046.94s)]
*  You just don't think of your country as a place where that could happen. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5047.54s)]
*  But why aren't the more I think about it, the matter I get, and the more afraid I [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5050.5s)]
*  get, I didn't see anybody with that view in Milwaukee. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5054.78s)]
*  And I don't hear anyone with that view in the media. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5059.26s)]
*  Like why are we ignoring this? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5061.02s)]
*  And you could hear this as well from a lot of people just saying, Hey, we [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5063.94s)]
*  support the secret service. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5068.62s)]
*  We support the secret service, secret service. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5069.7s)]
*  Great. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5071.3s)]
*  That being said, I will say, and you may not have seen this, there was a moment [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5071.5s)]
*  where Kim Cheadle come, the head of the secret service arrives in Milwaukee, goes [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5074.98s)]
*  into the five-star forum and is surrounded by senators and attendees and delegates. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5080.94s)]
*  And they just start screaming at her. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5086.78s)]
*  They just start absolutely laying into her. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5088.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5090.5s)]
*  But that's the point where someone makes a citizen's arrest and says, you know, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5090.7s)]
*  I'm sorry, this is the guy got shot in the face because of your, at very best [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5094.62s)]
*  negligence. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5100.78s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5101.7s)]
*  It doesn't seem like maybe Americans or maybe conservative Americans or non-liberal [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5102.5s)]
*  Americans or whatever people I know are just not good at drawing the line. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5108.06s)]
*  Like this has to be the line. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5111.900000000001s)]
*  You cannot allow this or they're going to shoot you. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5113.14s)]
*  I mean, that's just super obvious to me. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5116.54s)]
*  You cannot allow this. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5118.1s)]
*  Was that that famous soul citizen quote, you know, they, they arrested a third of [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5119.46s)]
*  the population of Leningrad or something. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5123.38s)]
*  And looking back from the Gulag, we all wish that we just said no. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5125.3s)]
*  Did you know what I mean? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5130.780000000001s)]
*  And like put up a bit of a fight. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5131.5s)]
*  And how would those officers have felt if they were the ones who were terrified of [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5133.9400000000005s)]
*  what would happen when they went home? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5137.54s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5139.3s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5140.58s)]
*  I don't think that we're thinking about this enough. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5142.34s)]
*  Like this was one of the biggest things that's ever happened in this country. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5144.62s)]
*  The, the, I don't want to say Republicans, but the, the side of the people, the side [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5148.06s)]
*  of freedom, you must team humanity, whatever you want to call it. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5155.66s)]
*  You can't let this go. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5162.54s)]
*  You can never let this assassination attempt go until we have the bottom of it. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5163.98s)]
*  Look what they did to Kyle Rittenhouse. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5169.58s)]
*  Okay, Tucker, look what they did to Kyle Rittenhouse. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5171.0599999999995s)]
*  And you were there. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5172.94s)]
*  I was there in terms of the investigation. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5173.26s)]
*  We have every piece of video footage from that day was brought up. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5175.74s)]
*  We have every piece of data. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5178.82s)]
*  The FBI held a plane that was flying overhead. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5180.46s)]
*  That was, I'm certain by the way, was also collecting cell phone information. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5184.58s)]
*  That's one of the reasons that they kept the same secret for so long. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5188.18s)]
*  Oh, and oh, by the way, the FBI agents testimony was, was done in the blind and [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5190.58s)]
*  then later stricken from the record. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5195.66s)]
*  And then, oh, we can't find the tapes of his actual, you know, his actual deposition. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5197.26s)]
*  So the FBI had footage overhead of what was going on. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5202.14s)]
*  They did all this to Kyle Rittenhouse, who just defended himself, who's a regular kid [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5206.74s)]
*  who defended himself and defended his town because he saw marauders coming in and [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5212.0199999999995s)]
*  trying to destroy everything. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5216.98s)]
*  And so we get all the footage, we can all the investigation, we get the prosecution, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5218.42s)]
*  we get everything that comes out of it. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5220.98s)]
*  And yet Donald Trump seems to be very likely to be the next president of the United States. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5222.94s)]
*  And we're told to just let it go. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5230.099999999999s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5232.82s)]
*  Now, if you care about your country and if you care about power, then what you would, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5233.54s)]
*  what you would do, by the way, is and it gets a little dark, but what you might do is to say, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5236.98s)]
*  all right, we've shown him how close we can get. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5243.099999999999s)]
*  Now we're going to start putting people around him that we want him to listen to. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5249.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, that that process has already begun. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5256.74s)]
*  OK, so you just said that if you were trying to take control of the United States [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5259.139999999999s)]
*  government and you thought that Trump was going to win or it was too much trouble to [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5266.46s)]
*  shoot him again, that you would try to subvert the movement from within. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5271.54s)]
*  Let's just back up one step. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5276.46s)]
*  If Trump had been successfully murdered, that would have pleased a lot of people. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5278.14s)]
*  I hate to say that, but it's true. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5283.34s)]
*  What do you think would have happened then? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5285.7s)]
*  Civil war. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5286.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's unfortunate. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5288.42s)]
*  I mean, I think that, you know, I think that at the convention, it was something that I [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5289.38s)]
*  didn't want. I wasn't ready to say it yet publicly. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5294.66s)]
*  It's so awful. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5297.34s)]
*  And so I was doing the shows and I was talking about it and, you know, it's kind of a [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5298.22s)]
*  rah rah event. And you were there. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5303.22s)]
*  It was it was fun. It was very, it was fun. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5304.74s)]
*  But at the same time, in the back of my head, I'm thinking. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5306.54s)]
*  This would never have happened, that something would have broken out. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5311.46s)]
*  And if if that bullet had been two inches to the right, I mean, you'd be looking at [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5315.099999999999s)]
*  massive uprisings all over the country. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5320.46s)]
*  You know, I that was my first reaction to. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5322.06s)]
*  But then I thought, you know, in order to rise up against something, you have to be [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5324.34s)]
*  organized. Well, and I'm not saying you're successful. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5328.900000000001s)]
*  And well, that's exactly right. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5331.780000000001s)]
*  And if you really think about it, yes, you know, Trump voters have lots of guns, but [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5333.34s)]
*  they have no way to communicate with each other. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5340.820000000001s)]
*  Well, Tucker, here's what would happen. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5343.740000000001s)]
*  Here's here's what would happen is you would see you would see pockets of uprisings [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5345.14s)]
*  and probably around Mar-a-Lago, different things like that. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5350.58s)]
*  And certainly different swaths of the country. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5353.38s)]
*  We can all do the math on where that would be. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5355.0199999999995s)]
*  And they would be put down and those people would. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5357.14s)]
*  So you take January 6th and then that operation that was run on people who attended [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5362.26s)]
*  January 6th would be run nationwide. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5368.0599999999995s)]
*  Of course, every Trump supporter becomes a member of the militia. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5371.26s)]
*  You're a member of the insurrection, not because you went to January 6th, but because [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5374.94s)]
*  you're a Trump supporter, your potential extremist. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5379.0199999999995s)]
*  Every white man in America is a suspect. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5380.74s)]
*  So the election is done at that point. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5382.5s)]
*  Yeah, the election is done. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5384.74s)]
*  So you're not voting. It's not a real election. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5385.74s)]
*  Sure. You go through the motions the same way they're going through the motions of [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5387.38s)]
*  this fake, you know, open primary, open process that Obama's talking about, but [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5389.86s)]
*  it's not real. So you would you would have it set up or to fait accompli where [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5393.82s)]
*  you've now criminalized your entire opposition nationwide. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5398.139999999999s)]
*  And you're sure there'd be there'd be fighting. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5401.42s)]
*  There's no question there'd be fighting. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5404.26s)]
*  There'd be bloodshed. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5405.34s)]
*  But I do think because of the lack of organization and because, look, you know, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5407.1s)]
*  despite what the media might tell you, that Republicans generally aren't [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5412.06s)]
*  insurrectionists, like people aren't actually just the opposite. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5415.14s)]
*  And even the system, they like the system that we had for 250 years. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5418.22s)]
*  It worked imperfectly, but still better than anyone else's system. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5422.02s)]
*  And these dark forces have destroyed the system. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5425.780000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't the right that did that. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5429.06s)]
*  You know, it wasn't. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5431.820000000001s)]
*  No, it certainly wasn't. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5433.58s)]
*  And so you see this through. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5434.5s)]
*  And by the way, this is what these dark forces do in any system where they want [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5436.34s)]
*  to whether it be pre-revolution France, whether it be Russia, whether it be Spain [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5440.18s)]
*  in the 1930s, whether it be, of course, China in the 1920s, 30s, 40s, et cetera, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5445.18s)]
*  going up to the founding of the People's Republic of China. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5451.82s)]
*  This is what always happens. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5454.1s)]
*  So you see the infiltration through the institutions. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5455.38s)]
*  You see agitation, by the way, you see direct operations run on the military [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5457.82s)]
*  like we saw in the Russian Revolution, that it was the military that was really [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5462.0199999999995s)]
*  heavily targeted and many of these units were used for radicalization. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5465.58s)]
*  So the deserters from the Imperial Army become the first units of the Red Army. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5469.459999999999s)]
*  Right. But instead of the guns pointing [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5474.58s)]
*  towards Germany, the German agent, Lenin, is then able to use them to turn their [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5476.58s)]
*  guns towards St. Petersburg. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5481.86s)]
*  And so this this level of subversion, this level of infiltration. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5483.98s)]
*  Now, of course, it's done differently now. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5488.099999999999s)]
*  And so because revolutions are different, because warfare is different. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5490.3s)]
*  So it's not third generation warfare anymore, fourth generation, fifth generation. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5493.46s)]
*  So we wouldn't expect to see literal civil wars. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5497.3s)]
*  You would see things playing out, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5500.22s)]
*  you know, some kinetic aspects, but mainly online. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5501.860000000001s)]
*  So online state power, regime power and pockets of resistance. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5504.18s)]
*  That's right. And to continue the analogy, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5508.46s)]
*  there's always a Kerensky who promises to return to like the sensible center, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5510.9400000000005s)]
*  but actually unwittingly or not is abetting the revolutionaries. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5515.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think Kerensky just got taken out. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5519.62s)]
*  Well, maybe that's maybe that's right. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5522.18s)]
*  But I certainly see a lot of them on the right. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5524.86s)]
*  I mean, there were there were Republicans yesterday. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5526.7s)]
*  Mitt Romney was one of them who were [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5529.3s)]
*  sort of sending out tributes to Joe Biden for his selfless act on behalf of the [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5531.58s)]
*  nation when it's not even clear that he had anything to do with it at all. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5535.98s)]
*  It was just transparently non-democratic would happen yesterday. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5539.86s)]
*  Transparently, and so for someone like Mitt Romney to, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5543.42s)]
*  you know, to endorse that is so dark. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5547.7s)]
*  Like, how can that guy be a senator, much less a Republican senator? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5550.22s)]
*  Meanwhile, at the same time, you've got Aaron Sorkin running around in op ed [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5553.18s)]
*  saying that that the Democrats should nominate is before we knew about the [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5556.98s)]
*  Biden dropped out. But yesterday morning, Aaron Sorkin has this huge piece saying [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5560.74s)]
*  that Mitt Romney should be the nominee of the Democrats to put him in. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5564.3s)]
*  And so this goes to show you that at the end of the day, they don't care about the [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5568.26s)]
*  are they don't care about the D, they don't care about whatever ideology they [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5571.54s)]
*  claim to be about. It's all about power. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5576.42s)]
*  It's all about the club. It's all about Leviathan. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5578.62s)]
*  It's all about the machine. And if you are going to keep things going, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5580.82s)]
*  if you're going to keep the machine going, if you're going to keep the permanent [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5583.42s)]
*  state going, the permanent managerial class, whatever, everyone's got their [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5585.9400000000005s)]
*  like their own name for it, whatever, what you want to call this system, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5589.26s)]
*  that you're going to keep that going. You're our guy. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5592.14s)]
*  So you got to wonder, this is unknowable, but Nikki Haley, who cheered the violence [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5594.86s)]
*  of the BLM riots, as Mitt Romney did as well. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5600.38s)]
*  What do you think she thought when Trump got shot, honestly? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5604.06s)]
*  Tucker, I think Nikki Haley is an opportunist. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5609.42s)]
*  I think she's someone who's incredibly ambitious. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5611.78s)]
*  I think she's willing to go with every way, whichever way the wind's blowing. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5613.94s)]
*  And I think Nikki Haley's first question probably was, how bad is it? [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5617.42s)]
*  Because she knew that the same forces, by the way, that were trying to block J.D. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5622.42s)]
*  Vance from becoming vice president would all have lined up behind a Nikki Haley [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5627.3s)]
*  candidacy at the convention. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5633.7s)]
*  So. We've got the Civil War aspect aside, let's say what happens to the primary. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5635.58s)]
*  It would have come down most likely to Nikki Haley versus Don Jr. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5642.179999999999s)]
*  I think that Don Jr. would have kind of inherited the certainly the sympathy [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5648.179999999999s)]
*  and also the legacy. He's got the name. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5652.5s)]
*  Everybody knows that he's his father's biggest supporter. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5654.98s)]
*  And, you know, he's got the name ID to actually do that. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5657.86s)]
*  So I think you would have seen the Trump grassroots base line up behind Don Jr. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5661.3s)]
*  But you would see the oligarchs, you would see the power, you would see the money. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5665.02s)]
*  A lot of this lining up behind as they were before. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5668.5s)]
*  I just don't understand the utility or the wisdom [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5671.900000000001s)]
*  in keeping people like Nikki Haley or Mike Pompeo around. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5675.38s)]
*  I mean, I had a friend once with an awful girlfriend [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5678.22s)]
*  and she's just not a good person at all. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5681.820000000001s)]
*  And he married her and she became an awful wife and then wrecked his life. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5684.740000000001s)]
*  And I'm not saying that people don't change or redemption is impossible. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5688.86s)]
*  Clearly, they do and it is. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5692.0599999999995s)]
*  But it's unwise to keep bad people around you. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5693.66s)]
*  And it's dangerous, actually. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5697.38s)]
*  I don't understand why Nikki Haley or Mike Pompeo, who's a criminal, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5698.94s)]
*  would be speaking at the Republican convention. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5704.139999999999s)]
*  That's not unity. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5706.58s)]
*  That's like that's a threat to you and to the country, I think. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5708.22s)]
*  And if you want to go really dark talker, the question is, [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5712.0599999999995s)]
*  do we have clarity on when Nikki Haley was actually added to the RNC platform? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5715.74s)]
*  When she was added to the schedule? [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5722.299999999999s)]
*  No, I don't have clarity on that either. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5723.66s)]
*  But I know that she initially wasn't there. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5725.339999999999s)]
*  So the story goes that Haley and Ron DeSantis, who had run against Trump [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5727.5s)]
*  in the primary, were initially not slated to speak on the RNC agenda. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5731.219999999999s)]
*  And at some point they were later put on. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5735.58s)]
*  Nikki Haley, of course, mentions in her speech, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5740.099999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump wants me to be here. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5742.78s)]
*  And now there's that clip where it turns back to, I think it's Trump [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5744.18s)]
*  talking to J.D. Vance and he's sort of mouthing his lips. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5748.22s)]
*  And they've done the lip sync and says that [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5751.18s)]
*  the lip reading and says that that she wanted to speak. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5754.3s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5757.86s)]
*  So so she wanted to speak. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5759.54s)]
*  So Nikki Haley was able to push herself in. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5761.66s)]
*  And whoever's running that piece said, OK, well, in the name of unity, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5764.5s)]
*  we're going to let her in now. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5767.9s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump gets up at these state, these rallies again and again, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5770.099999999999s)]
*  and he recites the snake poem. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5774.139999999999s)]
*  He's talking about illegal immigrants usually. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5776.139999999999s)]
*  Well, wouldn't the same thing apply to Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5779.219999999999s)]
*  and John Bolton and all of these types? [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5781.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I guess, yeah, well, of course, I couldn't agree more. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5784.86s)]
*  And it's not a matter of punishing people or not practicing forgiveness, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5788.58s)]
*  which were required to practice. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5791.5s)]
*  And I think we should always extend forgiveness. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5792.94s)]
*  But it's it's a question of self protection. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5795.139999999999s)]
*  Do you want forgiveness? [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5797.259999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean suicide. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5798.259999999999s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5799.42s)]
*  And it doesn't mean you can forgive somebody and not invite them into your orbit. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5800.14s)]
*  Forgiveness is something that happens in your heart. Exactly. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5803.9400000000005s)]
*  It's not it's not I'm going to let you in my house now and sit at my table. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5805.9800000000005s)]
*  But the attempted murder of Trump just shows how deadly serious [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5808.82s)]
*  these people are, how high the stakes are. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5813.18s)]
*  And I just hope people are internalizing that lesson. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5816.06s)]
*  But they don't seem to be at all. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5819.5s)]
*  That the lesson is that all of this can end in the blink of again. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5820.9400000000005s)]
*  Half an inch to the right. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5825.02s)]
*  Yeah. Half an inch to the right. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5826.7s)]
*  And all of it goes away. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5828.1s)]
*  Then there's a massive fight. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5830.46s)]
*  Nikki Haley, Don Jr. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5831.700000000001s)]
*  But you look at some of this movement right now, and a lot of it is sort of [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5833.620000000001s)]
*  on the precipice of Donald Trump. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5837.1s)]
*  And because of his figure, because of his notoriety, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5839.660000000001s)]
*  because of his connection with the people. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5842.740000000001s)]
*  And by the way, the Democrats have this with like Barack Obama, for example. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5845.900000000001s)]
*  Or they did, I guess you could say. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5848.9800000000005s)]
*  In terms of their public, public support, not in terms of their [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5851.42s)]
*  institutional support, that you take him out and suddenly the whole thing's up for grabs. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5854.82s)]
*  All of it. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5859.86s)]
*  It does seem to me, impossible to know, of course, but the [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5862.139999999999s)]
*  decision to put JD Vance in as his running mate [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5865.9s)]
*  does make it a little harder to extinguish the ideas [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5869.62s)]
*  when Trump exits the scene. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5873.78s)]
*  I mean, it seems a little more more like Trump's party in a real way now [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5875.86s)]
*  than it did before. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5879.54s)]
*  Well, this was something and you had a tweet about this where [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5880.5s)]
*  talking about those forces that were trying to stop JD Vance [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5884.22s)]
*  and something I think that, you know, those of us that knew what was going on behind the scenes. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5887.26s)]
*  Are you talking about Lindsey Graham? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5891.94s)]
*  I am talking about that little liar, creepy little finger scooper. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5893.06s)]
*  That people don't quite realize what all was going on. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5895.9s)]
*  So what like what was really behind that? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5898.58s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5901.1s)]
*  It was just full court press by the worst people I've ever met [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5902.3s)]
*  and all of whom I know personally, not all I don't know, Ken Griffin, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5906.02s)]
*  but I know the rest of them personally, because I lived in D.C. my whole life. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5909.26s)]
*  And what was so striking to me, I mean, they're always behind the scenes [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5913.26s)]
*  lobbying campaigns for every position, every time power changes hands [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5917.46s)]
*  or someone who wants a piece of it. Got it. Same with money. Fine. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5920.5s)]
*  But I've just never seen a clearer cut alignment [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5923.78s)]
*  between like everybody with bad motives, everyone who wants more killing [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5927.94s)]
*  for its own sake, everyone who's driven by really, really unholy impulses. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5932.099999999999s)]
*  They were all on one side pushing Marco Rubio, who, for the record, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5937.219999999999s)]
*  I think is a perfectly nice person, and Doug Burgum, whom I don't know. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5941.98s)]
*  But they were I mean, they were adamant that it could not be J.D. Vance. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5946.299999999999s)]
*  And I do think you can judge in the same way you can judge a tree [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5949.98s)]
*  by the fruit it bears. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5953.179999999999s)]
*  You can judge people by their supporters or detractors. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5954.179999999999s)]
*  And like every bad person, the people responsible for every [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5957.379999999999s)]
*  horrible disaster this country has had over the last 15 years, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5961.179999999999s)]
*  they were all against J.D. Vance. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5965.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, and really against J.D. Vance. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5967.7s)]
*  I mean, I mean, like last minute desperation offers of all kinds of things, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5969.54s)]
*  just the ugliest kind of manipulation, lying, corruption, true corruption. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5974.34s)]
*  And I mean, and I mean, up until one p.m. on Monday, this was going on. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5980.3s)]
*  That's how high they thought the stakes were. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5984.7s)]
*  It wasn't just like, well, I kind of prefer Marco to J.D. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5986.42s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. And wow. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5988.86s)]
*  I just thought that is the force that needs to be excised from the Republican [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5991.58s)]
*  Party and they can join David Frum and Bill Kristol and all the rest of the [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=5996.62s)]
*  world's worst people in the other party. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6000.78s)]
*  Why do they have to? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6003.26s)]
*  Hang around there like you should have one semi decent option in American politics. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6005.42s)]
*  No. Right. And what are they doing here? [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6010.14s)]
*  Why are these people still here? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6013.18s)]
*  We can find another island of misfits somewhere and they can go right next to the first one. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6014.26s)]
*  And if you're into Stalinism, if you're into just like murdering people in faraway [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6018.58s)]
*  countries because it makes you feel like God, which is what guys like Frum and and [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6024.06s)]
*  Kristol and John Bolton. That's what they're into. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6028.740000000001s)]
*  Of course, they're like impotent with tragic personal lives, but they feel powerful [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6030.5s)]
*  because they get to kill Ukrainians. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6034.42s)]
*  We have a party for you. It's called the Democratic Party. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6036.54s)]
*  Like, what are you doing here? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6038.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. Well, and this is for the neocons in general. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6040.740000000001s)]
*  This is actually where they where they came from originally. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6043.1s)]
*  And the reason they came out of the Democrat Party and this is sort of the Tier 1s [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6045.26s)]
*  with like Irving and the rest came over over the Vietnam War. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6050.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And so, wait, you guys are going anti-war. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6054.22s)]
*  We can't have that. We need the war. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6056.46s)]
*  We need the killing. We need the destruction. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6057.82s)]
*  We need the. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6059.9s)]
*  I'll just call it. I mean, it's demonic. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6062.58s)]
*  It's demonic to want that level of death. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6064.42s)]
*  I've been to China, I've been to Vietnam, I've been to Russia, I've been to many of the places affected, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6066.22s)]
*  but Poland, obviously, that's been affected by the cities where my family comes from. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6070.74s)]
*  And and you just it's horrific. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6074.3s)]
*  It's. It's. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6076.38s)]
*  It's an it's an actual atrocity. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6078.74s)]
*  Well, of course, but the atrocity is the point. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6080.5s)]
*  That's what you realize. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6082.42s)]
*  And then you realize the point of the system is what it does. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6083.259999999999s)]
*  And this is and so for us, when we talk about the point of a system is what it does. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6085.9s)]
*  Point of the system is what I like that I've never heard that. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6091.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's sort of a that's not mine. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6093.62s)]
*  That's me going around. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6095.74s)]
*  But if you think of it, if if a system has a problem, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6096.54s)]
*  well, then that that that problem would be fixed in maybe the next iteration [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6101.139999999999s)]
*  or the next version of the system. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6104.58s)]
*  You push out an update, not like CrowdStrike, but, you know, an actual an actual fix. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6105.78s)]
*  You would do something to fix your system. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6111.14s)]
*  So why the Constitution has amendments, they said, you know, maybe we didn't quite get it right. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6112.58s)]
*  We're going to allow you guys to amend this thing. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6115.9s)]
*  And as you go as you go and work things out, maybe maybe you need to. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6118.1s)]
*  For example, one of the early fixes in in that system was the presidency and the vice presidency. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6123.34s)]
*  This idea that the second most vote getter would be this vice president led to an administration [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6128.0599999999995s)]
*  that was just too factuous to to work together. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6133.22s)]
*  So fine. They came up with a new system where we all have sort of I don't know. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6135.860000000001s)]
*  No, I don't think I said now, but I catch myself because I'm not sure that's exactly what we have now, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6141.38s)]
*  because they always. But I've never seen a president and a vice president who didn't really hate each other. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6145.62s)]
*  Yeah. And now, well, hopefully, hopefully the next one. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6152.34s)]
*  That's true. There's something about the structure that makes it hard. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6156.54s)]
*  And it does. And. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6158.98s)]
*  The other idea, then, is that what if you leave that flaw? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6162.0599999999995s)]
*  What if the flaw is there and it's kept in every iteration, every update of the system, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6166.299999999999s)]
*  every version of the operating system that gets pushed out always has this zero day flaw that's still in it or zero day exploit? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6170.459999999999s)]
*  That's what hackers talk about. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6175.82s)]
*  And so you might start to realize that, wait a minute. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6177.459999999999s)]
*  What if that flaw that's creating this unwanted outcome actually is the real system? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6180.459999999999s)]
*  And everything that we've been told is just window dressing. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6188.58s)]
*  And so maybe the fact that communism kills 100 million people actually is the point of communism. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6191.62s)]
*  And it's not equality, justice, diversity, DEI, peace, land, bread, does Lenin's any of those things? [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6199.0599999999995s)]
*  What if the point actually is the killer? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6205.74s)]
*  And maybe if. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6207.26s)]
*  The victims are disproportionately Christian, which they have been always from French Revolution to present, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6209.86s)]
*  maybe the actual point is opposing Christianity. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6217.38s)]
*  Maybe a real enemy is Jesus. I'm just thinking. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6220.82s)]
*  I mean, if again, if the point of a system is what it does and every so-called communist revolution from well, [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6223.02s)]
*  from the Maoist Revolution to the French Revolution, to the Spanish Civil War, to the Soviet, the Bolshevik Revolution, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6229.34s)]
*  they all targeted Christians. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6238.18s)]
*  And maybe that's the real enemy for them. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6240.46s)]
*  The Christians are the ones that so we wrote on humans. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6242.3s)]
*  We had done this podcast series on Chronicles of the Revolution and China files. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6245.18s)]
*  And I was just sort of going through it from a from a history perspective. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6250.58s)]
*  And it was Christmas break and I wanted some extra content up there. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6254.5s)]
*  So let's just talk about communism. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6257.14s)]
*  But then as we started going through each of them, we really like a pattern just started emerging. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6258.66s)]
*  And the pattern was always the Christians are the first to go, whether it's under the gun, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6263.900000000001s)]
*  whether it's under the guillotine, whether it's under the knife, whatever it or in front of the cannon, whatever it is, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6269.42s)]
*  it's the Christians that are always lined up first to the point where Robespierre at the very end of the terror is executing nuns. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6276.78s)]
*  In the nuns. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6285.82s)]
*  I was about to say it wasn't. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6287.14s)]
*  The Sisters of Copignan are led to the streets of Paris. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6288.66s)]
*  So if French, a French monarchy, so a French monarchy or a Catholic monarchy in France, [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6292.9800000000005s)]
*  is completely overturned, the Notre Dame, by the way, another symbol, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6299.34s)]
*  which seems to be constantly under attack for some strange reason that can't help but notice, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6306.18s)]
*  by the way, Michelle Obama also standing right next to it when it's when it catches fire, sipping her champagne. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6311.3s)]
*  Back in 1798, it gets turned over from it gets deconsecrated as a cathedral. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6318.900000000001s)]
*  So it's deconsecrated as a cathedral and has turned into a temple of reason. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6327.98s)]
*  Of course. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6331.54s)]
*  So a temple to a not God, a temple to a demon, a temple to another figure that is not God, that is not worshipping Christ. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6331.98s)]
*  So and they hold these cults. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6339.98s)]
*  They actually called them cults back then, the cult of reason. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6343.7s)]
*  And so there were cult ceremonies that were held in Notre Dame. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6346.0599999999995s)]
*  Now, of course, it's been reconsecrated since then. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6349.18s)]
*  And there was a guy by the name of Napoleon that actually played a huge role in this the same way that [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6351.46s)]
*  when churches want to attack in Spain in the 1930s, Franco plays a huge role in the restoration of the church. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6357.26s)]
*  The same way that you see this in Russia following the end of the Soviet Union, the end of the Bolshevik rule. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6363.02s)]
*  The churches start to build again, start to get reconsecrated, etc, etc. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6368.900000000001s)]
*  You see this happening again and again. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6372.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, it's sort of interesting you mention that because, you know, the I mean, I'm 55, so I was here for it. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6374.620000000001s)]
*  The entire American left to one extent or another, very few explicitly, but all of them, in effect, supported the Soviet Union. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6379.9400000000005s)]
*  And they defended it, even sometimes well-attacked, but effectively, they defended it for the entire length of its existence. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6386.9s)]
*  From October 1917 to August 1991, they defended it. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6393.179999999999s)]
*  And then the second and they kind of were agnostic about Russia in the turmoil period. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6398.66s)]
*  They were happy to loot it, which they did. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6404.139999999999s)]
*  But it was only when Putin's and they weren't against Putin. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6406.379999999999s)]
*  It was only when he started talking about Christianity that he became, you know, the enemy, the overriding enemy. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6409.299999999999s)]
*  Barack Obama in 2014 says, Crimea isn't an existential issue for us, it's an existential issue for them. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6415.62s)]
*  And he kind of, he didn't give it his blessing, but in that sort of Barack Obama way, he was, right? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6422.18s)]
*  You know, Trayvon Martin could have been my son. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6427.18s)]
*  So he doesn't come out and say it, but that's him putting out his comment. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6428.9s)]
*  And in the Washington, Washingtonology that we have to do now, like the criminology. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6432.0599999999995s)]
*  So the Washingtonology is that, OK, when they put out a statement like that, that's so Obama's like the voice of God on their side. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6438.9s)]
*  He isn't the one, but he's the voice. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6444.46s)]
*  And so when he puts out a statement, that's OK, we're not going to do this. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6446.34s)]
*  We're not going to worry about this. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6448.9800000000005s)]
*  That's between Russia and Ukraine. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6449.9800000000005s)]
*  Who really cares? Not a big deal. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6451.3s)]
*  We're going to go in. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6452.860000000001s)]
*  But then the anti LGBT law comes out in Russia. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6454.1s)]
*  And that's the moment. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6457.860000000001s)]
*  And Pussy Riot starts going off and totally funded, by the way. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6459.06s)]
*  And then then suddenly Pussy Riot's like in the US and they're on House of Cards. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6463.66s)]
*  And then House of Cards goes from this British sort of like fun, backstabbing kind of show to this like massive anti Russia thing. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6467.74s)]
*  And there's these scenes with the Putin character, the Putin stand in, where he's saying, you know, I don't actually feel this way, but we must do this. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6477.98s)]
*  This is this is the end. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6485.38s)]
*  Like they're they're they're teaching that that Russia has become this anti homosexual country and that the entire point of the Russian government is to drive out homosexuality. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6486.46s)]
*  Which is not true, by the way. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6497.0199999999995s)]
*  But also, who cares? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6498.219999999999s)]
*  And it's also like. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6499.099999999999s)]
*  Who cares? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6499.86s)]
*  I mean, I don't understand, like, why is that our business anyway? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6500.419999999999s)]
*  It's and it's and suddenly everyone in D.C., the same way that the West Wing. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6502.94s)]
*  I know. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6506.74s)]
*  You know, set the show, I mean, Aaron's working on a reference again. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6507.219999999999s)]
*  Big L for those guys. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6511.259999999999s)]
*  A few good men still go. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6512.219999999999s)]
*  I'll give them that one. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6512.94s)]
*  That the same way that the West Wing set the stage for the Clinton years and beyond, it was this like this this, you know, this fake perfect version of the Clinton presidency. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6514.379999999999s)]
*  Then House of Cards sort of became this new mindset shift that was pushed. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6522.46s)]
*  You must hate Russia now. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6527.74s)]
*  You must hate Russia. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6529.1s)]
*  But specifically not because they're doing Russian things like maintaining access to their Black Sea fleet, which, you know, of course, they're going to do that. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6530.18s)]
*  You know, it's not right or wrong. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6539.9s)]
*  It's just that's their only port on the Black Sea. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6540.94s)]
*  They're going to want that. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6543.54s)]
*  They fought pretty hard for that over the years. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6544.3s)]
*  They're not going to give it up because we've instituted some coup. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6546.42s)]
*  And and by the way, keep in mind, Tucker, that at the time. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6550.06s)]
*  Obama didn't want us look paying attention to Ukraine too much because the coup was still ongoing. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6554.18s)]
*  And this is the coup that took out Yanukovych and led to the complete CIA, Victoria Nuland control of the current Ukrainian regime. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6559.740000000001s)]
*  Part of that rate you never have. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6568.540000000001s)]
*  Why didn't you have Russia sending sending armies across for all those years in the interim? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6571.22s)]
*  They wanted it so bad. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6577.780000000001s)]
*  Why not take it? The Ukrainian army didn't have any NATO support back then. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6578.74s)]
*  The Ukrainian army didn't have any constitution. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6581.66s)]
*  You could have they could have just signed a piece of paper and said, yeah, Ukraine is never going to be its own country if they wanted to take over all of Ukraine and all of Europe, as opposed to actually looking at a potential growing threat inside Ukraine. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6584.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And I agree completely. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6595.9s)]
*  And the bigger question is, why would we risk nuclear war over a law on sex education? [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6598.3s)]
*  And the answer is because it was pro-Christian. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6605.0199999999995s)]
*  That's why. And subverting Christianity is is the program. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6608.02s)]
*  That is the program. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6611.3s)]
*  Which which by the end. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6612.18s)]
*  So think about it, right. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6613.06s)]
*  And people say, well, wait a minute, Tucker. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6614.02s)]
*  But here in the United States, you know, churches, we church all over the place. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6615.18s)]
*  You can see them. You can drive around and here's a church, etc. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6617.9400000000005s)]
*  But I guess to borrow a phrase, the churches are in the closet. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6622.06s)]
*  And of course, right. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6625.34s)]
*  So you can go behind closed doors and you can pray to whatever God you want. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6626.38s)]
*  We're totally fine with that. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6630.660000000001s)]
*  Just keep it in there. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6631.860000000001s)]
*  Don't bring it out here. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6633.46s)]
*  Don't bring it into the public. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6634.660000000001s)]
*  Don't in the 1950s, we used to have the three crosses of Calvary [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6636.22s)]
*  were displayed across the skyline of New York City. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6640.06s)]
*  We'll never see that in our lifetime. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6644.42s)]
*  We won't. Maybe, maybe my kids will. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6646.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you don't know where this is going. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6649.62s)]
*  But right now, what do you see? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6651.22s)]
*  You see the trans flag. Of course, you see the pride flag. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6653.18s)]
*  And it's displayed on full promise. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6655.900000000001s)]
*  OK, that is subversion. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6657.9400000000005s)]
*  That that shows the ideological control, the ideological hegemon. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6659.740000000001s)]
*  That's the money that's taken over inside the United States. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6666.14s)]
*  So. Sorry, we just got breaking. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6669.38s)]
*  All right. This is from Charlie Kirk. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6677.860000000001s)]
*  I got a weird I'm reading this cold. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6680.22s)]
*  I got a weird lead on a story people ought to look into. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6681.660000000001s)]
*  I got a call from a source close to Las Vegas Metro police. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6683.700000000001s)]
*  The official story was that Biden's trip was cut short last week due to Covid. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6687.1s)]
*  However, according to this source, US Secret Service informed Las Vegas Metro [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6690.26s)]
*  that there was an emergency situation involving Joe Biden and to close necessary [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6694.54s)]
*  streets so that POTUS could be transported immediately to University Medical, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6698.62s)]
*  which began to which they began to do in earnest. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6702.0199999999995s)]
*  Then mysteriously, there was a standout order and the Secret Service informed [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6704.78s)]
*  local Vegas PD that they were going to medevac POTUS to Johns Hopkins, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6708.46s)]
*  which they presume meant flying back east as soon as possible. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6712.14s)]
*  Apparently, the rumor mill in the police department was that Joe Biden was dying [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6715.42s)]
*  or already dead, possibly. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6719.3s)]
*  I didn't think too much about this lead. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6721.66s)]
*  It seemed too wild to be true. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6724.1s)]
*  But given that Joe Biden has been out of public sight for days and dropped out of [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6725.5s)]
*  the race via an X-post and his brother James indicated health was a factor. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6728.660000000001s)]
*  I'm beginning to grow more curious if Covid or something else has been more serious than reported. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6732.58s)]
*  If anyone with Las Vegas Metro has information, please email freedom at Charlie Kirk dot com. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6737.02s)]
*  I want to hear if there is more to the official story than what they're telling us. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6741.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, I'm sure Las Vegas Metro would be just as just as open, as forthcoming as they were [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6746.02s)]
*  during the October shooting. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6750.3s)]
*  Yeah, the worst mass shooting in American history, which is never spoken of again. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6753.06s)]
*  They tried to drive me out of a camera position while I was doing a story on it. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6756.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6759.7s)]
*  Clearly, there's something known for being open and forthcoming. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6761.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6763.54s)]
*  Like the city itself. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6764.860000000001s)]
*  Clearly, something is going on here. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6767.18s)]
*  Obviously, I don't know what it is. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6769.38s)]
*  I know it's hallmark, which is secrecy. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6772.1s)]
*  Secrecy is the hallmark of lying. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6774.5s)]
*  So if you want to know someone lying, well, I don't know. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6776.820000000001s)]
*  Is he hiding something? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6779.34s)]
*  Well, then he's lying. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6781.26s)]
*  So they're lying. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6782.42s)]
*  So I just want to before we stop, because I want to put this up on the on the inner tubes very soon. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6784.02s)]
*  You just wrote a book on communist revolution called Unhumans. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6789.26s)]
*  I could ask you a million questions about this. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6792.9800000000005s)]
*  I think it's one of the most interesting topics there is. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6795.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6797.06s)]
*  But just tell us, like based on the research you did and the thinking you did while writing this, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6797.74s)]
*  what are the hallmarks? [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6803.74s)]
*  What are the signs of the kind of revolution that's destroyed so many countries? [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6804.74s)]
*  Well, so the first thing you would expect to see are these mass grievance outpourings and not just not just mass grievance outpourings. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6810.26s)]
*  And this is key, by the way, not just actual grievances from the people. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6821.179999999999s)]
*  You would expect to see it from the mouthpieces of institutions. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6825.0599999999995s)]
*  You would see it from universities. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6828.58s)]
*  You would see it from media, mass media. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6830.94s)]
*  You would see it from elected leaders or national leaders in some cases. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6833.94s)]
*  And not just grievances, by the way, about maybe something that's ongoing that can be fixed. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6838.379999999999s)]
*  Like, oh, the energy supply is having trouble. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6842.9s)]
*  We need more energy, like an actual grievance or we need more beds in our hospitals. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6844.94s)]
*  You know, something like this. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6849.74s)]
*  Those are legitimate actual grievances. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6851.259999999999s)]
*  I'm sure the functions of government. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6852.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6854.179999999999s)]
*  But what you would hear are more systemic grievances. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6854.7s)]
*  There is a problem with our system. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6857.86s)]
*  There is a problem with our government. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6860.379999999999s)]
*  There is a problem with our country. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6862.66s)]
*  The way that it is bounded. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6864.34s)]
*  Imprecise complaints that are impossible to address. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6865.42s)]
*  Precisely. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6867.74s)]
*  Racism, transphobia. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6868.46s)]
*  Well, OK, great. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6870.34s)]
*  What do I do about that exactly? [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6871.82s)]
*  What is the problem exactly? [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6872.9s)]
*  What is equity exactly? [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6874.26s)]
*  They're imprecise. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6875.82s)]
*  They're imprecise. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6876.78s)]
*  And so and then and then you would you would also expect to see [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6877.7s)]
*  ideological incohesion. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6883.94s)]
*  So the idea that you would stand for whatever is popular at the moment as a response to those grievances. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6885.94s)]
*  So we're going to beef up security, but also we're going to defund the police. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6892.54s)]
*  We're for more housing, but not housing over here. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6896.18s)]
*  We're going to do housing over there. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6898.94s)]
*  But we're also for price controls. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6900.74s)]
*  How do you have more housing plus price controls? [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6901.9s)]
*  Right. It doesn't never it doesn't possibly work in Thomas Soule's. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6903.46s)]
*  Obviously written a million times about this. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6906.54s)]
*  You would constantly be changing whatever your policies are because you don't actually care about your policies. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6908.1s)]
*  You're not ideologically driven and you're not pragmatically driven either. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6912.86s)]
*  You're always constantly telling people we need to do more. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6916.22s)]
*  We need to fight this imaginary force. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6919.38s)]
*  And because so white supremacy, Christian, white supremacy, Christian nationalism, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6922.34s)]
*  systemic racism, the police brutality. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6927.22s)]
*  Great example. Great example. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6932.1s)]
*  And everyone's always like, oh, you're back to blue. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6933.860000000001s)]
*  Whoever who that's so silly. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6936.58s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6937.58s)]
*  Like, obviously, people are going to be people and people make mistakes. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6938.38s)]
*  But body cams were introduced because we were told that police were lying about crime and they were making it all up. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6940.82s)]
*  And police in New York were just cracking down on black and brown people. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6949.18s)]
*  And that's why we need body cams everywhere. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6952.46s)]
*  So so police department said, fine, you know what? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6954.54s)]
*  Fine, we'll do the body cams. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6957.22s)]
*  You know what? Then you can finally believe what we're seeing. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6958.700000000001s)]
*  You know what the body cams show, Tucker? [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6960.820000000001s)]
*  That the level of crime was exactly consistent with what had been reported before. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6963.02s)]
*  And the body cams just showed the violent crime. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6968.18s)]
*  And so now you're starting to actually see because this was a direct progressive thing. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6971.06s)]
*  Body cams on cameras, body cams, police, body cams, police, body cams. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6977.46s)]
*  Now they say, well, we don't want the body cams because the body cams are helping the police too much and they're giving them surveillance options and they're being used to direct people. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6980.9s)]
*  Noticing is racist. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6988.78s)]
*  So wait a minute. You said you wanted this specific thing. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6989.78s)]
*  We gave you this specific thing and now you're against it because it's helping us. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6992.86s)]
*  So were you actually for truth? [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=6999.06s)]
*  Were you actually for fine noticing things that are going on in reality? [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7001.62s)]
*  Or are you driving towards something else? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7006.66s)]
*  Do you have something else that's hidden? [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7009.66s)]
*  And so what's underlying and what we found out in the book, of course, is it's always the overturning of whatever government is in place, whatever power is in place, whatever system is in place is completely overturned. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7011.94s)]
*  Spain, for example, Catholic monarchy, France, Catholic monarchy, both of those had to be overturned. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7026.26s)]
*  Both of those were usurped. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7032.74s)]
*  And as you said before, these attacks on Christianity are a hallmark, a direct hallmark. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7034.82s)]
*  So what we see in the United States, well, start slower, right? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7041.099999999999s)]
*  Because the United States, you have a problem. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7044.7s)]
*  You don't have the haves and the have nots. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7046.78s)]
*  The separation between oppressor and oppressed is harder in the United States because in a lot of the countries in the past where they've tried this, you have this sort of pyramid structure where you've got a couple of people at the top that are doing really well and a lot of people at the bottom that aren't. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7048.179999999999s)]
*  And so you get the people at the bottom and attack the people at the top. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7062.86s)]
*  That's Marxism. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7065.38s)]
*  Marxism is a tactic. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7066.219999999999s)]
*  It's on ideology. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7067.86s)]
*  It's not a belief system. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7069.099999999999s)]
*  It's just a tactic that's used to get all these people down here to fight those people up there. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7070.94s)]
*  No one ever read Das Kapital. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7074.94s)]
*  And the whole thing is it's nonsense. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7076.34s)]
*  It's right there. It's complete nonsense. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7078.34s)]
*  It's complete nonsense. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7079.179999999999s)]
*  And what you do in the United States then, because you realize, wait a minute, we've got this more of a diamond shape, right? [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7080.259999999999s)]
*  So in diamond shaped society where you've got this middle class, you say, okay, we've got these people in the middle and they're already kind of fat and happy because they're doing well and they've got kids and yards and suburbs and all of this. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7087.0199999999995s)]
*  So you look for other ways to divide up a society. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7101.299999999999s)]
*  You divide it up by tribe. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7103.5s)]
*  You divide it up by ethnicity. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7105.259999999999s)]
*  You divide it up by gender. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7107.0599999999995s)]
*  So you use sociology. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7108.62s)]
*  Then the Soviet Union falls, by the way. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7109.94s)]
*  And so you really have to get away from the economic stuff. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7111.62s)]
*  And so you say, fine, we don't worry about that. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7113.66s)]
*  But what we do worry about is what other kind of majorities are there? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7115.42s)]
*  Oh, there's a white majority. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7118.86s)]
*  Okay, so the white majority is oppressing everybody else. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7120.42s)]
*  And the white majority is actually the one that's doing all of this. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7123.46s)]
*  And then it plays on these ideas of white guilt as well to tap into the support for these, again, these other tribes that you're creating. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7126.58s)]
*  I'm not saying that they're creating races, but what I'm saying is you're splitting people up and pitting them against each other. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7133.9800000000005s)]
*  One of the most unfair things I've ever seen ever. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7138.66s)]
*  And the fact that, you know, the white majority put up with it for you in a second, it really says something bad about them, I think. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7142.78s)]
*  Like what? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7150.82s)]
*  So, I mean... [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7151.62s)]
*  Build the greatest country ever. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7152.46s)]
*  The most humane, fair, decent country with tons of flaws, but compared to what? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7154.5s)]
*  And sit there for years and have people spit in your face for something that you didn't do? [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7159.66s)]
*  You did just the opposite. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7164.78s)]
*  And are driven out from your cities, driven out from your towns, driven out from the places that you built. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7166.0199999999995s)]
*  And you put up with it. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7171.66s)]
*  I talk about my hometown all the time. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7172.74s)]
*  So this, like where I come from outside of Philly, it, like just outside Philly, it didn't really hit until like the 90s. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7174.02s)]
*  And that's when Section 8 started hitting. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7180.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's when all the drugs started getting flooded in. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7183.74s)]
*  And like right after we left, it becomes a sanctuary city. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7186.58s)]
*  So illegals were already bubbling up, but then it's like officially becomes a sanctuary city. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7190.3s)]
*  And I remember being a kid and I'm like writing letters to the local newspaper, you know, don't do this. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7194.860000000001s)]
*  You are going to ruin everything in our town. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7199.66s)]
*  And this was like, you know, you're idyllic, not idyllic, but you know, it's a town. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7201.62s)]
*  It's like a town of real people who knew each other, who grew up together, who lived there for a hundred years with all the families. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7205.5s)]
*  You know, it's intertwined, the good, the bad, the ugly, all of it. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7211.82s)]
*  But you know, the kids that I grew up playing with were the children of the kids my father grew up playing with and his father. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7215.099999999999s)]
*  We were all baptized at the same church. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7224.26s)]
*  We were all born at the same hospital, that kind of place. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7226.38s)]
*  Ever since we came from Poland for, again, a century. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7229.06s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, government comes in and not just government by itself, by the way, but specific forces within the federal government. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7231.660000000001s)]
*  It's just it's just my town. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7241.580000000001s)]
*  Like this was done across the country, towns after town after town. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7243.46s)]
*  And Jeremy Karl, of course, is a great book about it. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7245.9800000000005s)]
*  That you but it's just it's just knowing that experience and knowing that I won't have that for my kids. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7249.46s)]
*  No, but the the effect was just destruction. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7255.82s)]
*  And that's the thread that connects all the revolutions that you consider in this book. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7259.62s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7263.94s)]
*  Is that things? [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7264.54s)]
*  Yeah, OK, you can have a violent revolution. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7265.62s)]
*  It's not that hard. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7267.219999999999s)]
*  You just have to be willing to kill people. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7268.58s)]
*  And, you know, they have been. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7270.0599999999995s)]
*  But the effect wasn't an improvement. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7272.46s)]
*  It was a dramatic decline in people's happiness, standard of living. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7274.98s)]
*  Life expectancy. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7279.9s)]
*  Yeah. And then, of course, the death toll was in the tens of millions. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7280.94s)]
*  So if you're a Russian serf and you go to be so Russian serf and you say, oh, let's get rid of the czar. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7284.26s)]
*  And then everything's going to be great. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7289.62s)]
*  So you get rid of the czar and you kill him and his family and you're slaughtering the children. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7290.62s)]
*  And suddenly, I think it's going to get better. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7295.46s)]
*  No. Now you've got to go work on the commune. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7297.9400000000005s)]
*  And if you complain about it, you get sent to the Gulag. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7299.7s)]
*  So that raises like a really interesting point that I never hear anybody ask, which is, OK, so like the famous Robespierre, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7301.46s)]
*  speaking the revolution, the famous Robespierre phrase is you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7306.740000000001s)]
*  OK. Well, you know, I'm against that. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7313.22s)]
*  Chairman Mao said a revolution is not a dinner party. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7314.780000000001s)]
*  Right. That's right. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7317.1s)]
*  And I'm opposed to that. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7318.1s)]
*  However, it makes intuitive sense. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7320.46s)]
*  You have to do hard things to get good results. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7323.42s)]
*  But the results were worse every single time. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7325.66s)]
*  And just referring back to your great line that the point of an organization is what it does. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7330.62s)]
*  Point of system. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7334.9800000000005s)]
*  Rather a system than maybe making people suffer was the whole point. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7336.14s)]
*  So so this and we talk about this in the book. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7342.14s)]
*  So. In the Unhuman Playbook, if you just, again, looking at it from their perspective, people say now a rational person might say, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7344.620000000001s)]
*  how can you still support communism after communism's killed 100 million people? [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7351.860000000001s)]
*  Right. Well, turn that back around on itself. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7355.660000000001s)]
*  What if killing 100 million people was the point? [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7360.26s)]
*  If you talk to one of them and you actually got them to answer you truthfully, they would say that 100 million. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7363.02s)]
*  That's a good start. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7368.26s)]
*  We need to add to that because those were Christians, those were racists, [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7370.5s)]
*  those were people who stood in the way of our utopia. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7375.58s)]
*  And those people need to be removed from our system before we can have what it is that we truly want. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7379.58s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, and I think some people believe that. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7386.62s)]
*  I think, you know, Simon Sabag Bonifori wrote the most amazing book about Stalin with access to the internal archives called In the Court of the Red Czar. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7388.66s)]
*  But anyway, and we learn from Stalin's personal correspondence that he was actually a true believer. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7398.860000000001s)]
*  He believed in this. Yes. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7403.26s)]
*  But I think given the totally consistent track record of revolutions, [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7405.14s)]
*  all of which result in more human suffering, utopia never arrives the opposite, dystopia arrives. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7410.660000000001s)]
*  I just think at that point, it's obvious there are supernatural forces involved. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7417.18s)]
*  People are acting against their own interest as people. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7420.9400000000005s)]
*  The point is killing people. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7423.54s)]
*  If the point is killing people, that's not a human impulse. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7424.62s)]
*  That's a super, there are supernatural forces here. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7428.82s)]
*  One of the ways that, and you talk to Spanish Catholics about this, like Spanish Catholics have their eyes open, I should say, [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7432.0599999999995s)]
*  which I have and my wife and I went and visited the Valley of Fallen in research for this book. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7439.26s)]
*  And we walked around and we saw where Franco's original grave was and all of this. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7445.42s)]
*  And you realize that, wait a minute, this was the equivalent to a modern crusade, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7450.5s)]
*  what happened in the 1930s, because they saw demons, actual demons, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7457.26s)]
*  being taking the form of men and killing priests, raping nuns on the altar, [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7462.46s)]
*  and then taking the nuns' bodies and displaying the skeletons with their habits on in the public square [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7468.7s)]
*  and saying, this is a sign of what we will do to the church, what we will do to you, what we will do to your family. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7476.34s)]
*  The same forces get unleashed in China in the 1960s. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7482.7s)]
*  By the way, the help of a lot of Americans, by the way, Abraham Lincoln Brigade and a lot of others, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7485.06s)]
*  a lot of Americans- [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7490.7s)]
*  Ernest Hemingway is like hanging out, Emma Goldman. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7491.54s)]
*  Yes, George Orwell. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7495.02s)]
*  But Orwell actually comes out better than most in the wash. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7496.900000000001s)]
*  It changed his life. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7502.46s)]
*  He was shot in the throat on sentry duty. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7503.54s)]
*  He wrote a wonderful book about it, in which he doesn't mention being shot, I don't think, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7506.78s)]
*  but called Homage to Catalonia. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7510.7s)]
*  But that completely changed his- [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7512.22s)]
*  Which we referenced. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7513.78s)]
*  Oh, you do. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7514.38s)]
*  But it changes his worldview completely. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7515.18s)]
*  But my only point is, this wasn't about Spain. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7517.26s)]
*  No. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7520.98s)]
*  Do you think Ernest Hemingway or John Dispacos or all these sort of literary celebrities and leftists from the United States, [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7521.66s)]
*  do you think they knew anything about Byzantine Spanish politics, which is so freaking complicated, [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7527.58s)]
*  I tried to understand it. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7532.54s)]
*  It's impossible to understand any Spanish politics, period, always has been. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7533.7s)]
*  So they didn't have any understanding of this at all. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7537.1s)]
*  They were drawn by an instinct. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7539.82s)]
*  It's the marketing. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7542.66s)]
*  Toward darkness. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7543.42s)]
*  No, they were, though. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7544.38s)]
*  Well, so it's rooted in romanticism. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7545.22s)]
*  So it's this idea of, in the same way that it is Luciferian, right? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7547.86s)]
*  So the original, so original, original. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7552.98s)]
*  So Lucifer says, I can do better than God. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7556.7s)]
*  Look what God has created. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7559.5s)]
*  Look at all these problems. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7560.94s)]
*  Look at things aren't going well. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7563.14s)]
*  I don't like this. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7564.34s)]
*  I can do better than God. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7565.22s)]
*  I will create utopia on earth. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7566.9400000000005s)]
*  And so this is what leads him to rebel against the throne. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7569.14s)]
*  This is why Lucifer comes at God. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7571.46s)]
*  No, God of course destroys him because he's God. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7572.78s)]
*  So Lucifer and the fallen angels become the demons. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7574.62s)]
*  And the demons realize that, okay, you can't make open war on God [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7577.78s)]
*  because God will destroy you. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7582.7s)]
*  So what do you do? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7583.66s)]
*  You attack his creation. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7584.58s)]
*  So if God's connection to his creation is through the human heart, [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7586.22s)]
*  then that's where you strike. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7590.74s)]
*  So you take over through the heart and CS Lewis, of course, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7592.46s)]
*  screw tape letters, all of this, talk about it. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7595.86s)]
*  How this is how you're able to infiltrate the human heart. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7598.0199999999995s)]
*  And when you infiltrate the human heart, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7601.0199999999995s)]
*  you can suddenly turn it into these mad men, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7602.86s)]
*  the actual demonic control of individuals [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7606.98s)]
*  through these ideas of what we are doing [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7610.62s)]
*  is for the greater good. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7613.099999999999s)]
*  What we are doing is for the future. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7614.66s)]
*  We are smashing the old. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7616.42s)]
*  And so you require these propaganda operations again [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7617.66s)]
*  and again and again, over time and over time [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7620.34s)]
*  to be able to get people to commit some of the most horrific, [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7623.02s)]
*  again, in raping nuns on an altar. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7628.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7632.42s)]
*  It's happened a lot. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7633.26s)]
*  The bayonetting of the Romanov children, bayonets [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7635.14s)]
*  against children. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7638.900000000001s)]
*  People think they were shot, they weren't. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7639.74s)]
*  Little girls and boys, they were also shot and bayoneted. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7641.38s)]
*  Yeah, but they were almost all, [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7645.9400000000005s)]
*  the testimony that came out much later was [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7648.5s)]
*  they were almost all of them alive from the shooting stop. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7650.62s)]
*  One of the reasons for that is, and it's horrific to say, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7654.3s)]
*  but so this is the, they're in the Ipatiev house [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7657.14s)]
*  in Yekaterinburg. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7659.900000000001s)]
*  And they say the guards aimed too high [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7661.78s)]
*  because the kids weren't tall enough. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7667.1s)]
*  That when, so the first volley, [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7669.26s)]
*  they see their parents being killed. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7670.58s)]
*  And they say, by the way, that Alexandra, [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7672.02s)]
*  the Tsarina that she died making the sign of the cross [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7677.06s)]
*  as her children lied there. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7683.06s)]
*  And just remember a lot of the ruling class [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7684.9800000000005s)]
*  of Russia supported this crap at first. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7688.620000000001s)]
*  Well, they supported it. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7691.02s)]
*  They said, oh, we need to go along. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7691.860000000001s)]
*  We don't want to upset the boat. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7692.900000000001s)]
*  We don't want to be, [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7694.900000000001s)]
*  With the Black Lives Matter. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7695.740000000001s)]
*  We don't want to be politically, by the way, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7696.660000000001s)]
*  Tucker, you see this again and again. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7698.34s)]
*  You see it in the French Revolution too, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7700.540000000001s)]
*  where Louis goes along with it. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7701.820000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7703.02s)]
*  Louis goes along with it and says, you know what? [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7703.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, these are fine. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7704.9800000000005s)]
*  Just some reforms. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7706.139999999999s)]
*  They're just, and at first it was just like some tax stuff. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7707.099999999999s)]
*  We just need sentencing reform, actually. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7708.94s)]
*  Just criminals. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7710.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7711.42s)]
*  Yeah, so the next stage is they release the criminals. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7712.259999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7715.259999999999s)]
*  The criminals go in and this is the anarcho tyranny. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7716.099999999999s)]
*  So anarcho tyranny comes in, by the way, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7717.9s)]
*  not to necessarily destabilize the country [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7720.54s)]
*  or inflame the country. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7724.0199999999995s)]
*  Anarcho tyranny is used to pacify the middle class. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7725.46s)]
*  So the criminals are out there [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7730.54s)]
*  and you're supposed to just sort of keep your head down. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7732.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, the planes have all been shut down again [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7734.9s)]
*  so I can't fly today [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7737.78s)]
*  because CrowdStrike passed a bad update. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7738.7s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7740.42s)]
*  And you just accept more and more and more. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7741.82s)]
*  I lived in that neighborhood. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7744.66s)]
*  Totalitarianism over and over and over. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7745.82s)]
*  You accept more violence over and over. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7748.54s)]
*  And I guess the answer, and we do, by the way, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7750.259999999999s)]
*  give some hope at the very end of all this, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7753.379999999999s)]
*  is it doesn't have to be this way. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7755.139999999999s)]
*  We actually don't have to live this way, as a matter of fact. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7756.86s)]
*  Every person has the ability, [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7760.379999999999s)]
*  whether it's within your own circle, [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7762.339999999999s)]
*  within your own town, [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7765.34s)]
*  or perhaps you've got a big platform [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7766.0599999999995s)]
*  or you're someone like Trump who's running for office. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7769.5s)]
*  You have the ability to actually change things. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7772.66s)]
*  And we talk about local libraries [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7774.9s)]
*  and parks and recreation centers. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7778.0599999999995s)]
*  I know it sounds kind of silly, [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7779.26s)]
*  but it's like your local communist, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7780.14s)]
*  they're looking at the public library [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7783.5s)]
*  and they know that if I can get into that library [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7785.26s)]
*  and I can get that front row of books [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7787.42s)]
*  that comes in every time you walk into a library. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7789.82s)]
*  And currently it's pretty much every public library [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7791.54s)]
*  in America, by the way, right now, [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7793.74s)]
*  that's how infiltrated we are. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7794.86s)]
*  You will be hit with political propaganda on racism [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7796.34s)]
*  and DEI and all this and transgenderism [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7799.42s)]
*  when you first walk in. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7801.34s)]
*  So when children walk in, why? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7802.179999999999s)]
*  Because the communist recognizes that as a note of power. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7803.5s)]
*  So the communist will take it over. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7805.86s)]
*  They will infiltrate it and they'll take it over. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7807.22s)]
*  Then look at the parks and rec department. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7808.74s)]
*  So I get that there's like this conservative response [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7810.26s)]
*  to say, oh, drag queen story hour, drag queen story hour. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7814.78s)]
*  But it's like, well, but do you understand what's going on? [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7817.0599999999995s)]
*  Do you understand you're looking at a system? [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7819.0599999999995s)]
*  Do you understand you're looking at a system [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7820.7s)]
*  that's playing out exactly how it was designed to play out [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7822.06s)]
*  because the point of the system is what it does. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7826.42s)]
*  So your local communist is looking at that [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7828.18s)]
*  parks and rec department saying, I've got to get in there [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7829.820000000001s)]
*  and I've got to start indoctrinating the children. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7831.860000000001s)]
*  And I've got to turn the children against the parents [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7833.740000000001s)]
*  because again, that's exactly what they do every time. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7835.580000000001s)]
*  And so you're sowing the seeds [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7838.780000000001s)]
*  for this eventual takeover in total power. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7840.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and if you can't recognize what happened [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7845.06s)]
*  nine days ago as a watershed, [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7849.38s)]
*  they shoot Trump in front of all of us. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7852.7s)]
*  You don't see that as a turning point then. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7855.74s)]
*  And think of it. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7858.38s)]
*  So Trump's assassination attempt, [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7859.22s)]
*  Steve Bannon locked up as a political prisoner, [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7862.1s)]
*  Peter Navarro just gets out as a political prisoner. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7864.5s)]
*  The palace coups of sitting leaders, [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7868.66s)]
*  all of this has happened before, all of this. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7873.74s)]
*  Literally to the letter has happened before. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7875.7s)]
*  The only point is if you're just sitting there [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7878.9s)]
*  going with the flow saying, oh my gosh, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7881.54s)]
*  I can't understand what happens next. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7883.339999999999s)]
*  All of this has happened before. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7884.98s)]
*  I'll tell you exactly what happens next. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7885.82s)]
*  And it gets really dark if people don't fight back. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7887.299999999999s)]
*  Jack, thank you. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7890.58s)]
*  We're going to put this up. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7892.38s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7893.42s)]
*  Thanks man. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7895.74s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7896.58s)]
*  That was awesome. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7897.42s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7898.259999999999s)]
*  I know. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7905.94s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7906.78s)]
*  with everything at stake, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7909.34s)]
*  Google would be putting its thumb on the scale [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7910.58s)]
*  and preventing you from hearing anything [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7913.34s)]
*  that the people in charge don't want you to hear. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7916.54s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7918.219999999999s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7919.78s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7920.62s)]
*  but that's a waste of time. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7922.34s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7923.58s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7924.94s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information that's true. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7926.7s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7930.7s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7932.7s)]
*  is to subscribe to our channel. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7934.74s)]
*  Subscribe and you will have a much higher chance [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7937.66s)]
*  of hearing what we say. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7940.58s)]
*  And we hope you will. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24fKGJ2JPo&t=7941.46s)]
