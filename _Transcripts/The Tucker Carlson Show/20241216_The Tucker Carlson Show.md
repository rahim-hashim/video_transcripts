# Jeffrey Sachs The Inevitable War With Iran, and Biden’s Attempts to Sabotage Trump
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA)
*  Well, first of all, thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=0.0s)]
*  So many things have happened in the last two weeks. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2.16s)]
*  I keep thinking, where's Jeff Sachs? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  I want to know what this means. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6.72s)]
*  So the most dramatic and from my perspective unexpected thing that happened was all of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=8.38s)]
*  a sudden the government in Syria changed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=12.8s)]
*  There was regime change in Syria. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=14.4s)]
*  Who did that? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=17.18s)]
*  Why and what does it mean? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=18.26s)]
*  Well, it's part of a 30 year effort. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  This is Netanyahu's war to remake the Middle East. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=23.7s)]
*  It's been a disaster. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=28.96s)]
*  It continues to be a disaster. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=30.04s)]
*  But as Netanyahu himself said after Assad left, we have remade the Middle East. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=32.68s)]
*  And so it has to be understood as something that didn't just happen in a week, but has [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  been an ongoing war throughout the Middle East. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=45.8s)]
*  And maybe the right way to understand what's happened with Syria is to think back to a [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=58.96s)]
*  really remarkable occasion when Wesley Clark, the general who headed NATO, went to the Pentagon [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=76.44s)]
*  after 9-11 and famously he showed a piece of paper that said we're going to have seven [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=86.44s)]
*  wars in five years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  And he was completely dumbfounded. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  He said, what does this have to do with anything? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=97.68s)]
*  And he was told that the neocons and the Israelis are going to remake the Middle East. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  And the seven countries on the list are very telling. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  They were Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and then in Africa, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=111.0s)]
*  And seven countries, we've been at war in six of them now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=122.68s)]
*  And I mean we, the United States, on behalf of Israel, including in Syria. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=128.48s)]
*  And so what happened in Syria last week was the culmination of a long-term effort by [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=133.94s)]
*  Israel to reshape the Middle East in its image. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  It started with Netanyahu and his American advisors in 1996 in something called Clean [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=145.5s)]
*  Break, which was a political document that the Americans and Netanyahu made when Netanyahu [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=151.74s)]
*  became prime minister. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=158.74s)]
*  After 9-11, it went into full gear with the Iraq Wars being the first of those wars. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=161.06s)]
*  Clean Break, what does that refer to? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=167.98s)]
*  Clean Break is we're going to make a clean break of the Middle East. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=169.58s)]
*  A break with the past. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=173.86s)]
*  We're going to break with the past. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=174.9s)]
*  We're not going to have land for peace, which is the idea that Israel would have a Palestinian [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=176.3s)]
*  state next door. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=183.5s)]
*  No, we're going to have greater Israel and we're just going to bash anybody that doesn't [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=184.66s)]
*  like it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=190.02s)]
*  And we're going to do that by bringing down any government that supports the Palestinians. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=191.18s)]
*  It's a rather shocking amount of hubris. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  It has been, in my view, a complete disaster for the United States and for the Middle East. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  It has been Netanyahu's MO since 1996, actually, and he's been prime minister more than half [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=208.5s)]
*  the time since then. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=215.5s)]
*  And the United States goes to war on his behalf. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=217.74s)]
*  And what happened in Syria is the culmination of that effort. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  So seven wars in five years. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu came to the US in 2002, excuse me, after 9-11. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=231.38s)]
*  Actually, he came in September 20, 2001, if I remember correctly, and gave a speech that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=240.7s)]
*  said there's terrorism, but you don't fight the terrorists. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=247.7s)]
*  You fight the governments that back the terrorists. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  That's the idea. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=255.14s)]
*  So you go to war. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=256.48s)]
*  You don't just have a kind of an anti-terrorism effort. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=258.3s)]
*  You go to war. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=261.5s)]
*  And the first of those wars was Iraq. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=263.26s)]
*  But Syria was supposed to be exactly the next war. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=266.02s)]
*  And the timeline was this remarkable idea of seven wars in five years. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=270.34s)]
*  According to all of the understanding that we now have from lots of insiders, from documents, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=276.9s)]
*  from the archives, what happened was the US got bogged down in Iraq. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=283.58s)]
*  There was the insurgency. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  They didn't move onward to the next war, which was to be Syria, which was to happen [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=289.82s)]
*  already 20 years ago. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=295.92s)]
*  But in 2011, what really brought Assad down last week started under Obama. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=298.26s)]
*  And yes, and this is also interesting. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=306.86s)]
*  It doesn't really matter who's president. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=312.1s)]
*  This is long-term deep state policy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=314.4s)]
*  Obama ordered the CIA to overthrow Assad. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=319.3s)]
*  So that started in 2011. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=323.94s)]
*  Why would Obama want to overthrow Assad? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=326.1s)]
*  Because Israel has run American foreign policy in the Middle East for 30 years. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=328.74s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=335.98s)]
*  We have an Israel lobby. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  We have this clean break strategy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=339.64s)]
*  We have a plan for seven wars in five years. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=343.54s)]
*  What's interesting is they actually kind of carry out this madness. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=349.02s)]
*  They don't explain any of it to the American people. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=353.78s)]
*  They don't tell anybody, but you can watch step by step. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=356.26s)]
*  We've had six of those seven wars. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=361.18s)]
*  The only one that hasn't happened is Iran. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=364.46s)]
*  And if you watch every day now, the MSM, the mainstream media, is pushing for US war with [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=368.5s)]
*  Iran. Netanyahu is pushing for war with Iran. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=377.86s)]
*  They're really trying to get this started to make seven out of seven. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=380.5s)]
*  But Obama, you know, for no particular reason, by the way, but he launched two of these wars [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=384.5s)]
*  on the list of seven. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=393.42s)]
*  He launched the war to bring down the Libyan government, Muammar Gaddafi, in the fall of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=395.42s)]
*  the war started in March 2011. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=402.66s)]
*  And he and Hillary Clinton, his secretary of state, said Assad must go in the spring [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=408.5s)]
*  of 2011. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=416.5s)]
*  I remember scratching my head at the time saying, oh, that's interesting. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=418.3s)]
*  How are they going to do that? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=422.42s)]
*  Syria was a normal functioning country at the time, despite whatever you read, whatever [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=425.62s)]
*  propaganda is said. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=432.54s)]
*  Syria was a normal functioning country. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=435.22s)]
*  I recently dredged out a report by the International Monetary Fund on Syria in 2009 that praised [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=437.98s)]
*  the Syrian government for its reforms and its rapid economic growth and looked forward [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=446.02s)]
*  to continued years of economic development. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=450.9s)]
*  In other words, it was not this wasteland or this battlefield. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=454.02s)]
*  It was an actual normal country. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=462.7s)]
*  Was it a threat to the United States? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=465.62s)]
*  It was no threat to the United States whatsoever. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=467.65999999999997s)]
*  But it was deemed to be, by Netanyahu, a threat to Israel because of a simple reason, which [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=470.38s)]
*  is that Netanyahu wants to control all of Palestine, wants to rule over the Palestinian [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=477.65999999999997s)]
*  people, does not want a Palestinian state, and that has led to militant opposition. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=485.5s)]
*  That's led to Hamas, that's led to Hezbollah, that's led to other groups. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=492.21999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu's theory is, well, we're never going to allow a Palestinian state, so we have to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=496.34s)]
*  bring down any government that supports those militant groups against us because our core [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=502.1s)]
*  aim is greater Israel. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=508.90000000000003s)]
*  That's not much of a worthy cause, by the way. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=511.86s)]
*  Having a Palestinian state next door and having peace could have saved probably a million [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=516.1s)]
*  lives by now over the last 30 years, but that's not Netanyahu's crazy ambition, which is... [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=521.38s)]
*  What is greater Israel? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=529.6600000000001s)]
*  Greater Israel means, depending on how crazy the people are, either that Israel controls [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=531.22s)]
*  not only its geographic territory, but that it essentially controls or annexes the West [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=540.94s)]
*  Bank, the Golan Heights, which they've just enlarged, Gaza. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=549.5s)]
*  Golan Heights being part of Syria, historically. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=554.5s)]
*  It was part of Syria, it's claimed by Israel, and now with an expanded territory, and East [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=558.02s)]
*  Jerusalem. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=567.46s)]
*  So everything that was captured in 1967, Netanyahu explicitly said, we're never giving that back. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=568.46s)]
*  Now there are two motivations for that. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=576.7s)]
*  One, Netanyahu says, not safe to give it back because he doesn't want to negotiate any kind [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=579.74s)]
*  of peace or any state of Palestine. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=585.5s)]
*  Then there are religious zealots, I would use even stronger terms, who use the Book [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=589.06s)]
*  of Joshua, which is 2,700 years ago, that said, well, God gave us everything from the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=599.46s)]
*  river in Egypt, meaning the Nile, to the Euphrates. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=608.22s)]
*  And there are zealots in Israel, and they're in the government, who believe, yes, this [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=612.46s)]
*  is God's ordinance, we're going to take whatever we want. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=617.82s)]
*  So the Niles, the Euphrates would include what? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=621.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, if you take the greater view of this, it would include Lebanon, it would include [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=625.4200000000001s)]
*  Syria, it would include part of Iraq, it would include part of Egypt. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=633.22s)]
*  Some of these people actually quote the Bible and say, we're going to do this. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=638.14s)]
*  It's a little sad and absolutely terribly frightening. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=645.4599999999999s)]
*  But I'd say the more narrow vision is what they call from the river to the sea, from [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=652.3s)]
*  the Jordan River to the Mediterranean. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=658.38s)]
*  It's taken as a pro-Palestinian chant, but it's exactly the opposite. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=661.14s)]
*  It is the greater Israel literal vision of the government of Israel. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=669.06s)]
*  It's the literal idea. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=676.06s)]
*  There happen to be seven million Palestinians there, that's a minor problem. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=677.86s)]
*  Maybe they can be ethnically cleansed, maybe they can be thrown out, maybe they can just [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=683.86s)]
*  be ruled in a military dominant way. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=688.9000000000001s)]
*  Of course, probably well over 100,000 have been killed in the most recent war by Israel. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  Official count, 45,000 of bodies claimed from the rubble, but we know that there are a lot [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  more that have died since this war in Gaza began. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=713.18s)]
*  But all of this is to say, this greater Israel idea says we can't make peace with the Palestinians, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=719.14s)]
*  so anyone that supports the Palestinians is by definition a mortal threat to us. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=729.78s)]
*  When you have a mortal threat, you must destroy it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=737.74s)]
*  This is the opposite of diplomacy, it's war, and as Netanyahu crowed last week, it's war [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=741.74s)]
*  to remake the Middle East. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=747.78s)]
*  It's all spelled out, by the way, in very clear ways, but you have to dig for them, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=751.98s)]
*  you have to find them, you have to understand that this is long standing. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=758.38s)]
*  You have to understand that each president has played part of that role. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=763.78s)]
*  When we come back to Obama, he started the war with Syria in 2011. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=769.22s)]
*  I can remember actually vividly the call that Assad must go. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=776.26s)]
*  I did scratch my head, I was actually, I think I was on Morning Joe when it was said, and [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=785.54s)]
*  I was asked by Joe Scarborough, what do you think? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=791.22s)]
*  I said, well, that's pretty odd, how's he going to do that? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=794.26s)]
*  It turned out it was going to be 13 years of mass war, 300,000 dead, and destroying [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=798.86s)]
*  a country, that's what it turned out to be. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=805.0200000000001s)]
*  But Obama signed an order called Operation Timber Sycamore. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=807.86s)]
*  People should look it up, you can find it online, but you can't find it in the mainstream [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=813.86s)]
*  media because it's not discussed. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=819.1s)]
*  But it was a so-called presidential finding that the CIA should work with Turkey, with [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=822.58s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, with others to overthrow the government of Syria. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=829.46s)]
*  So that was the plan. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=836.34s)]
*  We went to war, we had... [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=839.26s)]
*  This is what led to Benghazi, correct? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=841.7s)]
*  Benghazi is Libya. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=843.94s)]
*  I understand. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=845.58s)]
*  Yes, but it was the same time in 2011. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=846.58s)]
*  My understanding was the reason there were so many American intel assets there was because [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=849.66s)]
*  they were moving arms from Libya to... [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=854.02s)]
*  Oh, sorry, yes, if you say it that way. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=857.66s)]
*  One of the first things was to establish a rat line, so-called, from Libya to Syria, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=860.66s)]
*  absolutely. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=868.3s)]
*  And Seymour Hersh wrote a terrific piece explaining all of that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=869.3s)]
*  That was never explained. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=873.58s)]
*  I mean, I worked at a news organization at the time that made a lot out of Benghazi and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=874.58s)]
*  the death of the U.S. ambassador and what was the Obama administration thinking? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=877.8199999999999s)]
*  They were so negligent. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=883.6999999999999s)]
*  But there was never any discussion about what they were doing there in the first place. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=885.1s)]
*  No, none of this is explained, of course. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=888.8199999999999s)]
*  This is... [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=891.26s)]
*  It's none of the public's business. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=892.26s)]
*  This is our business. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=894.5s)]
*  We're the war machine. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=896.14s)]
*  You stay out of this. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=897.14s)]
*  So none of this is explained. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=898.14s)]
*  Interestingly, the whole Syrian operation... [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=900.5s)]
*  I think I counted right that the New York Times mentioned Operation Timber Sycamore, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=906.26s)]
*  I think, three times in the 2010s. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=911.0600000000001s)]
*  So a war that caused billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives, CIA operation, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=913.98s)]
*  covert action, links with Libya, never explained, never discussed. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=921.3000000000001s)]
*  Even when the government falls last week, no background given. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=927.7s)]
*  You know, we're supposed to have amnesia. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=933.26s)]
*  We're not supposed to understand that what happens is the result of long-term plans that [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=935.0600000000001s)]
*  have been pretty disastrous. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=941.46s)]
*  And by the way, as I've said, Israel has driven so many American wars. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=945.46s)]
*  And we say, absolutely, yes, that's our greatest ally. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=952.62s)]
*  These have been at huge cost to the United States, cost of trillions of dollars, cost [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=956.46s)]
*  geopolitically, but somehow we gave away our foreign policy to Israel years and years ago. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=962.3000000000001s)]
*  And it's been absolutely devastating. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=971.6600000000001s)]
*  And it's interesting to go back and watch Netanyahu speak to the American people. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=974.14s)]
*  Go look at a video clip of 2001, 2002. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=980.34s)]
*  In 2002, in October, he comes and testifies in the Senate. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=984.22s)]
*  And there's a nice clip of him promising how wonderful the war in Iraq is going to be. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=989.1s)]
*  Because Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=995.4200000000001s)]
*  He says 100% certain. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1000.1s)]
*  Complete lies, by the way. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1002.9s)]
*  And they knew that they were lies at the time. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1003.98s)]
*  And it's going to be wonderful. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1007.1s)]
*  We're going to topple that dictator. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1008.1800000000001s)]
*  And then dictators are going to be toppled everywhere. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1010.4200000000001s)]
*  And the young people of Iran are going to rise up. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1013.52s)]
*  This is his idea, together with his US political consultants, together with neocons in the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1016.76s)]
*  US government for the last 25 years. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1025.32s)]
*  They have never apologized for dragging the United States into countless wars in the Middle [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1028.3s)]
*  East, spending trillions of dollars running up US debt and doing what? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1034.12s)]
*  Creating chaos. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1040.8s)]
*  So just to go back to the seven countries, because it's worth remembering, Lebanon, it [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1042.56s)]
*  barely exists as a functioning country right now. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1050.0s)]
*  Syria, it's going to be picked to pieces. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1053.44s)]
*  Don't believe, well, it's obvious in what we're seeing every day. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1057.0s)]
*  Territorial integrity, yeah. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1061.8s)]
*  Israel's just invaded from the southwest into a deeper Syria. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1063.44s)]
*  Turkey from the north. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1069.32s)]
*  Syria has its area, the United States and the Kurds have their area. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1071.44s)]
*  This place is just going to be a battlefield for years to come. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1076.1000000000001s)]
*  Iraq, we know what happened with Iraq. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1080.2s)]
*  Trillions of dollars, a complete destabilization of the country. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1083.52s)]
*  Look at the other three wars. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1089.28s)]
*  The United States broke apart Sudan. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1092.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1094.68s)]
*  Well, Sudan was an enemy of Israel. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1095.68s)]
*  So we have to break apart Sudan. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1099.08s)]
*  So we supported the South Sudanese. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1100.8s)]
*  Now we have the real trifecta, massive civil war in Sudan and massive civil war in South [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1103.1999999999998s)]
*  Sudan. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1111.8s)]
*  In other words, we broke apart the country and now there's civil war in both halves of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1112.8s)]
*  the country. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1117.0s)]
*  Somalia basically doesn't exist as a country. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1118.1599999999999s)]
*  Libya, it doesn't exist. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1121.9199999999998s)]
*  It's a battlefield. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1123.72s)]
*  It's a war zone. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1124.72s)]
*  So that's six out of six. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1125.9399999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu's crowing. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1128.04s)]
*  Now we go on to Iran. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1130.2s)]
*  Do you ever feel like you can't trust the things you hear or read? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1131.68s)]
*  Like every news source is hollow, distorted or clearly just propaganda lying to you? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1135.1s)]
*  Well, you're not imagining it. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1141.08s)]
*  If the last few years have proven anything, it's that legacy media exists to distort the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1142.96s)]
*  truth and to control you, to gatekeep information from the public instead of letting you know [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  what's actually going on. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1153.0s)]
*  They don't want you to know. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1154.12s)]
*  But there is, however, a publication that fights this, that is not propaganda, one that [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1155.8s)]
*  we read every month and have for many years. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1160.84s)]
*  It's called Imprimis. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1163.04s)]

*  in the final days. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1317.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1319.66s)]
*  They were involved in the 13 years nonstop. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1320.66s)]
*  I don't understand how. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1325.22s)]
*  Actually, let me tell you an interesting story, by the way. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1326.98s)]
*  The war started in 2011. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1331.78s)]
*  It was portrayed as always as the CIA does as a local uprising and the freedom fighters. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1338.3s)]
*  It was said this was Syrians protesting against Syria. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1347.8600000000001s)]
*  That's always how any CIA regime change operation works. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1352.02s)]
*  There may also be local opposition, but the CIA provides the armaments. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1357.02s)]
*  It provides the flow of heavy weapons. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1363.5s)]
*  It provides the financing. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1365.4599999999998s)]
*  It provides the training. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1366.9399999999998s)]
*  It provides the camps. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1368.1799999999998s)]
*  It provides the political organization. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1369.78s)]
*  So this started in 2011. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1372.5s)]
*  In 2012, there was already a bloodbath underway and a lot of people dying and a lot of civilians [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1377.82s)]
*  dying in a lot of ancient historic sites because this is the Fertile Crescent. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1383.78s)]
*  This is the birthplace of humanity itself, of civilization being destroyed. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1390.12s)]
*  So a very senior global diplomat that I knew very, very well was tasked with trying to [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1396.74s)]
*  find peace. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1407.6599999999999s)]
*  Peace, nice idea. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1408.6599999999999s)]
*  Maybe we don't need the bloodbath. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1411.0s)]
*  And I met him in the spring of 2012 and he said it failed and said, why did it fail? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1413.8999999999999s)]
*  He said, well, we had a full peace agreement, but it was blocked by one party alone. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1423.46s)]
*  We had the different forces in Syria. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1428.96s)]
*  We had the regional, but it was blocked by one who was blocked by the United States government. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1431.42s)]
*  Why? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1438.46s)]
*  Well, because their condition was that Assad must go on the first day of the agreement [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1439.46s)]
*  rather than a political process. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1447.1s)]
*  Everyone else agreed on a political process, but the United States said, no, no, this is [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1450.38s)]
*  regime change. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1455.14s)]
*  Assad must go on the first day. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1456.14s)]
*  And that was not possible. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1458.76s)]
*  So that was the end of the attempted peace. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1460.04s)]
*  So we should understand this was an American operation. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1463.22s)]
*  But I never understood, what I didn't understand and still don't understand is why we're all [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1468.78s)]
*  required to hate Assad. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1473.02s)]
*  Speaking for myself, I don't have strong feelings about Assad one way or the other. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1474.54s)]
*  He's protected the Christians, so I'm grateful for that as a Christian. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1479.3s)]
*  But why am I required to hate Assad? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1482.06s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard went and met with Assad. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1485.82s)]
*  She's been attacked ever since. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1488.26s)]
*  Has anyone ever explained why Americans should hate Assad? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1489.86s)]
*  Because every regime change operation we ever do, we have to make sure that the opponent [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1495.6999999999998s)]
*  is the worst villain since Hitler or Hitler reincarnate. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1503.54s)]
*  Some ophthalmologists from London is a bloodthirsty dictator. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1508.28s)]
*  I never, I didn't really... [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1511.2s)]
*  We have to say this and this is part of the Psy Ops or the Info War that goes along with [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1512.56s)]
*  regime change operations. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1519.78s)]
*  This is completely typical. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1521.48s)]
*  And we're told if we don't stop him now, it's only going to spread. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1524.32s)]
*  He'll be in Des Moines. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1529.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1531.04s)]
*  This is the Nicaraguans were going to be in Harlingen, Texas, remember? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1531.88s)]
*  This is standard fare. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1539.2800000000002s)]
*  It's so pedestrian, such bad script writing that you can't believe it's still rolling out. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1542.92s)]
*  But why doesn't someone at the New York Times just ask the obvious question, which is why [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1549.48s)]
*  am I supposed to hate Assad exactly? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1552.44s)]
*  Why is it somehow a test of my loyalty to the United States? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1554.3600000000001s)]
*  Would I think Bashar al-Assad? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1558.1200000000001s)]
*  Like who cares? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1560.1200000000001s)]
*  That's such a core question. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1561.76s)]
*  I've never heard anyone ask that. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1563.7199999999998s)]
*  Can I laugh when you mention New York Times? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1565.04s)]
*  Because they won't cover any historical background of any conflict at all. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1568.2399999999998s)]
*  Because all of this is aimed at a free hand for the security state, a free hand for the military. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1577.4799999999998s)]
*  But why would the New York Times be parroting the security state? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1588.96s)]
*  Well, I think that's a question that goes back decades, partly because it's staffed [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1592.8000000000002s)]
*  in part by probably people from the intelligence agencies. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1600.64s)]
*  We've known that for years. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1605.5600000000002s)]
*  Or the New York Times. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1606.88s)]
*  We know in the past that CIA just had reporters on the payroll. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1609.52s)]
*  Whether they do or not now, I have no idea. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1615.0s)]
*  So I'm not making a current claim. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1617.28s)]
*  But we know that that's a historic fact. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1618.84s)]
*  We know historically that with very rare exceptions, the New York Times has just followed the unnamed [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1621.16s)]
*  official sources that this is the whole MO. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1631.4s)]
*  This patriotic newspaper follows what it's told to do. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1634.36s)]
*  And it doesn't ask questions. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1639.64s)]
*  It has not asked any questions about any of these wars in recent memory. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1642.08s)]
*  Not about Ukraine. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1647.1999999999998s)]
*  Not about the wars raging throughout the Middle East. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1648.32s)]
*  As I said, I think there was one full page actually about Operation Timber Sycamore in [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1654.08s)]
*  2016. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1660.12s)]
*  You would think that something that got us into a war of 13 years where we spent billions [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1662.1999999999998s)]
*  of dollars, where hundreds of thousands of people died, even at this stage, there would [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1668.6s)]
*  be a kind of page or a box explaining the historical background to this. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1673.72s)]
*  But it didn't exist. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1679.48s)]
*  I actually wrote, I have to say I wrote to one of the reporters saying, couldn't you [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1681.6399999999999s)]
*  mention a little background? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1685.44s)]
*  He said, oh, very interesting idea, Mr. Sacks. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1686.44s)]
*  So I'm waiting. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1689.96s)]
*  You wrote to an New York Times reporter. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1693.28s)]
*  Well, I know these people for decades. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1694.6s)]
*  And by the way, not only do I know them, and some I like very much, by the way, and some [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1698.8000000000002s)]
*  have been classmates of mine a long time ago. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1704.3600000000001s)]
*  And they know things that they don't report. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1708.52s)]
*  And that's also important to understand that what they will say in private is the opposite [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1712.0800000000002s)]
*  of what their newspaper says. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1718.72s)]
*  And I mean literally the opposite. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1720.64s)]
*  So that's very worrying to me because we operate foreign policy in secrecy. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1722.96s)]
*  We do not have any kind of democratic oversight of foreign policy. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1731.52s)]
*  There's no explanation of it. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1735.76s)]
*  There's no accountability for it. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1737.94s)]
*  It's in very few hands. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1740.48s)]
*  It's not in good or reliable hands. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1742.88s)]
*  It's not explained. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1745.68s)]
*  We gave over Middle East foreign policy to Israel a long time ago, not to US interests, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1747.48s)]
*  not to Israel's interests. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1752.3s)]
*  That is the Israel lobby. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1754.2s)]
*  And we don't hear questioning of this at all. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1756.86s)]
*  Of course, not from the government, not from the Congress, not from oversight by any democratic [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1762.54s)]
*  institutions, nor does the mainstream media, which fewer and fewer people are interested [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1769.1399999999999s)]
*  because they don't get any facts from it, look into these issues. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1777.1000000000001s)]
*  What happens next in Syria? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1783.28s)]
*  Well, there'll be continued war. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1784.8600000000001s)]
*  And now the drumbeat is for war with Iran. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1787.52s)]
*  Anything is possible. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1793.82s)]
*  Netanyahu dearly wants the US to go in and bomb Iran. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1795.38s)]
*  Probably some of President Trump's advisors will feel the same. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1800.82s)]
*  The incoming administration is a mix of old school hardliners and people with a very different [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1806.5s)]
*  perspective. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1813.42s)]
*  So there will be an internal battle for the heart and soul of the new administration. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1814.42s)]
*  But there will be some who say, yeah, now is time to carry on the war. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1821.22s)]
*  Hezbollah and Hamas have been weakened. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1826.02s)]
*  Syria has fallen. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1829.74s)]
*  The air defenses are gone. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1830.92s)]
*  Now we can fly and do in Iran. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1832.26s)]
*  Of course, all of this is a profound delusion. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1837.34s)]
*  And that's, I think, really important to understand. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1843.26s)]
*  We've had six wars so far, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, and Libya, six out [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1847.9s)]
*  of the seven that were on the list shown to Wesley Clark. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1857.7s)]
*  Not one of them has led to stability, to peace even, much less to geopolitical interests [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1861.74s)]
*  being solved. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1870.78s)]
*  So it's not like we're finding solutions to anything. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1871.78s)]
*  Yes, it has allowed at unbelievable cost Israel to hold on to the West Bank, East Jerusalem, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1879.02s)]
*  the Golan Heights, and Gaza as if that's some kind of grand strategic aim of the United [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1889.7399999999998s)]
*  States or justifiable in the face of international law and nearly global opposition to such thinking. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1897.62s)]
*  But it doesn't lead to any answers. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1907.78s)]
*  And there's no way to, quote, defeat Iran. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1911.1399999999999s)]
*  Even if we went in and bombed Iran, Iran has strong allies. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1916.74s)]
*  Iran has Russia and China as allies. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1923.02s)]
*  Iran is part of the BRICS. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1927.42s)]
*  Iran has a military relationship with Russia. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1929.66s)]
*  Of course, we have even crazier people who think we're going to defeat Russia. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1935.52s)]
*  Russia has 6,000 nuclear warheads, of which 1,600 are deployed. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1941.5800000000002s)]
*  It has its new hypersonic or Reshnik ballistic missile, which travels at Mach 11. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1949.5400000000002s)]
*  It has other hypersonic weapons. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1963.0600000000002s)]
*  We have people in the US who, in their mental blindness, think about continued escalation [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1966.98s)]
*  all the way to nuclear Armageddon. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1978.3400000000001s)]
*  They really do. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1980.66s)]
*  They're very ignorant people, and they're around in high positions. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1981.78s)]
*  What comes next is whether President Trump can change course. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1988.1000000000001s)]
*  This is the most important question facing the United States. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=1997.9s)]
*  And there are several different factions in Washington right now that are fighting for [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2003.26s)]
*  ultimate say. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2016.06s)]
*  There's a piece by Mitch McConnell, our octogenarian who is completely living in a delusional past, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2018.3799999999999s)]
*  who has a lead article in Foreign Affairs magazine calling for America to commit to [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2030.5s)]
*  primacy. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2038.3799999999999s)]
*  He calls for a massive military buildup to get ready for every kind of eventuality with [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2040.1799999999998s)]
*  Russia and China. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2047.9799999999998s)]
*  That's the old school, and it remains very powerful. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2049.58s)]
*  It's got very powerful interests because it's the biggest business in Washington, about [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2052.7799999999997s)]
*  $1.5 trillion of annual spending for the military machine. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2058.46s)]
*  And Mitch McConnell absolutely represents that. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2064.2999999999997s)]
*  Then there are groups that say, you know, we don't really have any fundamental conflict [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2068.58s)]
*  with Russia, and Russia's no real threat to us, but China's the real threat, so we should [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2078.58s)]
*  end the war in Ukraine, something I completely agree with. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2085.22s)]
*  But we should do it so that we build up and get ready for the war with China. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2089.82s)]
*  And this is kind of the middle ground, which is... [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2096.66s)]
*  A war with China. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2101.34s)]
*  A country that manufactures all of our antibiotics. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2103.34s)]
*  Everyone is talking about war with China in Washington by 2027. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2109.2599999999998s)]
*  And it's so weird, as if we just are trying to rush headlong into complete destruction. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2115.5s)]
*  But we have official documents, a Navy strategy saying we must prepare for war with China [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2125.58s)]
*  by 2027. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2131.46s)]
*  We had a major article in the New York Times, which I actually once upon a time read with [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2133.14s)]
*  interest. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2142.46s)]
*  But in any event, it was a story about the Pentagon preparing for war with China. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2143.46s)]
*  And I wrote the reporter, actually. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2149.2599999999998s)]
*  This is another... [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2152.22s)]
*  I know these people for decades. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2153.8199999999997s)]
*  So I wrote the reporter, and I said, thank you for writing that story. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2155.3799999999997s)]
*  I was happy to read it now, because there'll be no time to read it after the war. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2159.98s)]
*  We'll all be dead. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2164.2599999999998s)]
*  So I'm glad that we have the story now. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2165.2599999999998s)]
*  And the reporter wrote back to me right away, said, oh, Jeff, the editor... [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2169.02s)]
*  I had put in three times that the Pentagon doesn't want this war, but the editor took [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2177.2599999999998s)]
*  it out three times. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2183.04s)]
*  And I don't really know why. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2185.2400000000002s)]
*  And I didn't notice that in the hurrying to finish the piece. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2186.64s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2190.8s)]
*  You're one of our world's great journalists, a person writing a front page story about [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2194.16s)]
*  war, and she's written three times the Pentagon doesn't want it, and the editor takes that [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2199.64s)]
*  out all the time. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2204.12s)]
*  And she didn't recognize that. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2205.92s)]
*  That's the New York Times. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2208.44s)]
*  I don't know even what that means. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2209.44s)]
*  Well, that's when you quit. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2212.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, you can't allow that. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2213.2799999999997s)]
*  This is so amazing. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2214.88s)]
*  But yes, so there is a group gearing up for war with China. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2216.64s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2222.4s)]
*  Nuclear superpower with a much larger army on their shores. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2224.12s)]
*  The whole thing is beyond belief. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2232.24s)]
*  When there is a group, there actually is a group that says, hey, we don't need war with [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2235.24s)]
*  anybody. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2243.4799999999996s)]
*  We're not threatened. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2244.4799999999996s)]
*  The United States is more secure than at any time in history and any time that a country [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2245.4799999999996s)]
*  could be secure. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2252.64s)]
*  We have two big oceans. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2253.64s)]
*  No one can attack us. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2255.58s)]
*  We have every amount of deterrence. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2256.7999999999997s)]
*  China does not threaten us and could not threaten us. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2260.12s)]
*  And so what are we talking about war this way? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2264.4s)]
*  Why are we in war with Russia in Ukraine? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2267.44s)]
*  And that is a US-Russia war, as everybody should understand. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2271.0800000000004s)]
*  Why are we at war all over the Middle East? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2274.92s)]
*  And that is a US war. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2277.0800000000004s)]
*  We've got absolutely troops on the ground. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2279.7200000000003s)]
*  We have troops on the ground, of course, but we have forces on the ground. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2285.36s)]
*  They're often CIA or covert. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2288.56s)]
*  But yes, this is our wars. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2293.24s)]
*  We're paying for them. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2294.72s)]
*  We're financing them. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2295.72s)]
*  We're arming them. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2296.72s)]
*  We're the intelligence, if you can use that word. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2297.72s)]
*  Why do we need a war with China? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2302.2799999999997s)]
*  And so there are people who say, hey, why don't we make business, advance technology, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2306.4399999999996s)]

*  And that group is also part of the Trump incoming team. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2321.88s)]
*  And this is probably the most consequential question that a country could face, is which [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2326.92s)]
*  of these different voices will prevail in this new administration? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2333.44s)]
*  This time of year, we are focused on our families because we're apt to be with our families, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2338.36s)]

*  I've never felt more uneasy than I have in the last few weeks during this period between [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2424.96s)]
*  the election and the inauguration. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2430.56s)]
*  And it does what doesn't seem like it is a fact that the outgoing administration is [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2432.28s)]
*  trying to accelerate conflict to leave the incoming administration in charge of a bunch [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2436.36s)]
*  of different wars, especially with Russia. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2441.48s)]
*  I have to say, I think the Biden administration has been the worst of our governments in modern [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2444.0s)]
*  history. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2451.48s)]
*  And that's saying a lot because I'm a complainer. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2453.6800000000003s)]
*  So I don't generally praise administrations. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2456.44s)]
*  I like to think of myself as a responsible tough grader. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2461.8799999999997s)]
*  And I haven't given high marks to any administration from Clinton onward. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2467.24s)]
*  I think they've all been failures. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2474.2799999999997s)]
*  But Biden's administration has been a complete shocking disaster, which has brought us closer [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2476.4599999999996s)]
*  to nuclear war, brought us into more conflict. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2485.2799999999997s)]
*  And I don't have one iota of diplomacy. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2490.72s)]
*  I don't count diplomacy meaning you go talk to a junior ally. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2494.68s)]
*  I mean, diplomacy meaning you talk to someone on the other side to figure out how to escalate. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2500.08s)]
*  And we know, you know very well, and you heard it recently from the Russian foreign minister [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2507.7599999999998s)]
*  that our secretary of state and the Russian foreign minister have not spoken at all for [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2517.44s)]
*  years. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2524.36s)]
*  This is the most mind bogglingly stupid approach to our security and survival imaginable. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2525.9s)]
*  And as far as we know, and this is what Lavrov said in his interview with you, Biden and [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2534.84s)]
*  Putin have not spoken once since February 2022. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2543.56s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2550.08s)]
*  To not even speak, to not try to understand each other's position, to not discuss, to [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2554.0s)]
*  not try to find a way out when now the most accurate assessment is that there are at least [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2560.16s)]
*  a million Ukrainians dead or severely wounded since February 2022 and the United States [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2567.32s)]
*  hasn't lifted a finger, not even one time to try to talk to the other side. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2574.8s)]
*  So yes, this has been a shockingly terrible government. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2581.48s)]
*  Biden, we don't know really, you may know, I don't know whether he's Kompas-Mentis. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2587.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know whether the guy thinks I'm told till four in the afternoon he can still function [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2592.88s)]
*  to some extent. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2599.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know if it's true. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2600.6400000000003s)]
*  But Jake Sullivan, Antony Blinken, I regard as complete failures. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2602.32s)]
*  Sullivan's job is our security. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2611.28s)]
*  He's not made us any more secure. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2613.76s)]
*  He's made us profoundly insecure. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2615.82s)]
*  And we're getting closer and closer to nuclear war. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2618.86s)]
*  The only way we avoid that realization is to laugh away every statement and President [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2622.84s)]
*  Putin said it again today, by the way, that we are absolutely mocking Russia's serious [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2631.48s)]
*  red lines. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2640.32s)]
*  Is that really for our security that we don't have a discussion about them even? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2641.7200000000003s)]
*  And we're not. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2649.6800000000003s)]
*  And everything, yes, is escalating. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2651.72s)]
*  We see little fires being set all over the neighborhoods of these war zones. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2653.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's not only throughout the Middle East and the drumbeat for war with Iran. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2662.84s)]
*  It's not only Biden authorizing the use of long distance strikes into Russia, which, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2668.4s)]
*  President Putin has accurately said and has not been denied by the United States, are [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2677.84s)]
*  actually US strikes on Russia. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2684.1200000000003s)]
*  But this is incredible. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2688.36s)]
*  How would we feel if Russia were attacking the United States? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2689.6400000000003s)]
*  Would we say... [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2695.8s)]
*  And trying to kill the president. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2696.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2697.8s)]
*  We are trying to kill Putin right now. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2698.8s)]
*  Would we say that's just fine? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2699.8s)]
*  Don't worry if Americans are getting a little upset about that. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2702.6000000000004s)]
*  But that's literally what Biden has approved. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2706.92s)]
*  And then we see hotspots around. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2710.92s)]
*  You have to be really into this to be following them. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2713.52s)]
*  But in the country of Georgia, in the South Caucasus region, there's a little typical [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2717.92s)]
*  regime change maneuver that's been underway in recent weeks. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2726.04s)]
*  It will not succeed. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2730.7200000000003s)]
*  But the aim was to destabilize that region. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2732.2000000000003s)]
*  The hand of the US is absolutely clear in that. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2736.6400000000003s)]
*  We see in Romania another bizarre episode where a presidential election was in its second [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2740.88s)]
*  round and the lead candidate was saying we should end the war with Ukraine. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2748.52s)]
*  And the Supreme Court of Romania annulled the election, claiming Russian interference. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2754.44s)]
*  And so that candidate that was calling for peace could not win election. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2762.68s)]
*  We're seeing those kinds of events all over. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2769.64s)]
*  What are we seeing in South Korea? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2773.28s)]
*  In South Korea, of course, we saw something that we don't understand that's also mind-boggling, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2775.76s)]
*  which was an attempted coup by the president of Korea, President Eung, who called out the [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2783.4s)]
*  military to surround and arrest the parliament. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2791.16s)]
*  And ultimately, the coup failed and the president was thrown out of office. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2796.08s)]
*  But why he made that coup is not absolutely clear. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2800.7999999999997s)]
*  And the US reaction was bizarre. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2806.44s)]
*  The US said we're watching with concern. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2810.6s)]
*  That was all. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2814.04s)]
*  It didn't say anything about restore the constitutional order or we're against the coup or anything [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2815.3999999999996s)]
*  else. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2820.88s)]
*  And there was a glimmer of possible reason. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2822.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't want to overstate any certainty on this because this is, of course, also not [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2828.48s)]
*  analyzed properly or made public so we don't have the information. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2837.08s)]
*  But the week before the military action, the coup attempt, there was a visit by the Ukrainian [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2842.5s)]
*  defense minister for armaments from South Korea, something that the United States has [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2851.5s)]
*  been pushing very hard for. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2857.06s)]
*  The United States has been trying to get South Korea to ship arms to Ukraine because the [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2859.5s)]
*  US inventories are depleted. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2865.1s)]
*  And South Korea, under its law, cannot do so because it cannot ship arms to belligerents [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2869.1s)]
*  that are engaged in war. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2876.46s)]
*  And the parliament opposed it. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2878.8199999999997s)]
*  The parliament president does not have a majority in the parliament or the former president. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2883.54s)]
*  And the opposition opposed the armaments. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2889.58s)]
*  So there's some possible relationship with this that when Yoon declared martial law, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2894.98s)]
*  he said that the opposition was siding with the North Koreans. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2903.98s)]
*  That was his statement. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2909.44s)]
*  And some read that as a way to clear the way for South Korea to enter the Ukraine war with [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2911.26s)]
*  massive arm shipments. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2919.94s)]
*  I don't know whether that's the case, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's the case. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2921.78s)]
*  Maybe we'll find out. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2927.28s)]
*  It happens that the acting president was my first PhD student at Harvard now. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2929.1600000000003s)]
*  So I go back with him 44 years, which is nice. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2934.9s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2940.98s)]
*  Yeah, just a coincidence. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2941.98s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2944.7000000000003s)]
*  I meant to ask you, why did Russia stand aside as Assad fell? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2945.7799999999997s)]
*  I think that it was a, first of all, a military choice because Russia is in the midst of a [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2952.66s)]
*  very tough war along a 1200 kilometer front in Ukraine. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2963.3799999999997s)]
*  It did not want to divert any major military effort in that direction. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2971.9399999999996s)]
*  Second, the proximate reason why Assad fell was that the main military backing of Assad [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2979.3399999999997s)]
*  was Hezbollah forces and the Iranian Guard. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2989.18s)]
*  And they had both been, especially Hezbollah had been very badly mauled by Israel in the [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=2996.02s)]
*  last month and a half and had pulled its reinforcements from Syria to reinforce Lebanese positions. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3005.9s)]
*  And so Assad was left without the backing of Hezbollah forces, several thousand, which [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3014.86s)]
*  was the bulwark of his military. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3021.14s)]
*  I think a third reason is that Russia doesn't think it's leaving Syria, that this isn't [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3024.4199999999996s)]
*  the end of the story. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3030.54s)]
*  And immediately, the supposed new force in Syria, the HTS, said that it wants Russia [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3032.62s)]
*  to stay and to keep its bases in Syria. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3043.22s)]
*  Russia has a naval base and a small one and an airfield. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3046.4199999999996s)]
*  Russia has redeployed its forces from within Syria to both of those bases, but is probably [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3053.18s)]
*  not leaving. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3060.62s)]
*  So I think from probably a strategic calculus, Russia just regards this as a temporary step [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3061.8199999999997s)]
*  on a path to continued conflict and that this was not the time to get into another major [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3070.94s)]
*  front. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3080.7799999999997s)]
*  And that would be my assessment. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3081.98s)]
*  So we've got a little over a month between now and the inauguration, clearly as noted [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3084.26s)]
*  that Biden administration is trying to make decisions that are irrevocable and deepen [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3090.38s)]
*  the war between the United States and Russia and then all these other things. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3095.42s)]
*  If you were the Trump people right now, before the inauguration, what would you be doing? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3099.5s)]
*  I would first be clear. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3105.26s)]
*  Under the Constitution, Biden is president until January 20th. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3110.9s)]
*  I think it's right to say that Biden should not put America into further insecurity. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3115.42s)]
*  He's done enough damage. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3125.7000000000003s)]
*  And so I think it's right for every political figure to say to Biden, you're at the end [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3127.74s)]
*  of your term and the world is very dangerous. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3135.2999999999997s)]
*  You do not have a mandate to increase the danger. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3140.06s)]
*  You should never have authorized the use of Atacams and other US missiles in deep strikes [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3143.8999999999996s)]
*  into Russia. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3153.7799999999997s)]
*  You should stop further provocations now. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3156.34s)]
*  So I hope that politicians of both parties and I think President Trump can also make [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3159.6200000000003s)]
*  this clear. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3167.1800000000003s)]
*  It's not to take over the government until January 20th. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3168.1800000000003s)]
*  But Biden absolutely, in my view, is without the legitimacy to further endanger us. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3172.0s)]
*  They should prevent any actions from abroad that threaten American security, of course, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3185.86s)]
*  but I don't see those happening. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3193.82s)]
*  I think the biggest risk right now is continued US provocations of the kind that we've been [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3196.02s)]
*  discussing in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in the periphery of Russia, in the Far East. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3203.06s)]
*  Stop any further provocations. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3211.38s)]
*  The idea of somehow tying Trump's hands is completely illegitimate constitutionally [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3214.68s)]
*  and politically, and it's a disastrous approach. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3224.64s)]
*  We're not playing a game of two people or a game of two administrations. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3229.24s)]
*  We're trying to survive at a time of perhaps maximum global peril right now. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3233.7999999999997s)]
*  So just to say, most experts that look at this think we're closer to nuclear war than [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3242.84s)]
*  we have ever been. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3249.84s)]
*  And I refer often to the doomsday clock of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which is [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3251.88s)]
*  the graphic to demonstrate how close or how far we are from nuclear war. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3258.48s)]
*  And that doomsday clock puts the clock at 90 seconds to midnight, which is the closest [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3264.6800000000003s)]
*  to nuclear Armageddon that it has ever been since the clock was first rolled out in 1947. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3272.2799999999997s)]
*  So I think it behooves those people who are making the decisions in the Biden administration [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3281.06s)]
*  to stop imperiling Americans at this point and to understand that their job right now [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3290.24s)]
*  is to keep things stable, to give power over to President Trump on January 20th, 2025. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3298.88s)]
*  One of the promises of the new administration is massive declassification. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3309.04s)]
*  Pardon for... [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3315.7200000000003s)]
*  Please, if it could only be. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3316.7200000000003s)]
*  This would change so much. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3319.36s)]
*  So one of the things that I'm interested in learning about is 9-11, because I think it's [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3321.8s)]
*  important to understand why that happened. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3328.08s)]
*  And I think my guess is that one of the reasons so many documents from 9-11 are still classified [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3331.0s)]
*  23 years later, it's hard to imagine why, is because they tell a more detailed story [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3336.0s)]
*  about why Al-Qaeda struck the United States. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3342.08s)]
*  And it seems clear it was a response to... [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3346.44s)]
*  And I'm not defending it, of course, obviously, but it was still cause and effect. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3348.92s)]
*  And the cause was American foreign policy. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3354.64s)]
*  Was a response to that. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3356.6800000000003s)]
*  A, do you think that's true? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3357.6800000000003s)]
*  And B, if it is true, then how afraid should we be about future terror attacks given what [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3360.8s)]
*  we've been doing? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3367.48s)]
*  Well, let me say something about declassification. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3368.48s)]
*  We had one and only one close look at the CIA in its entire history of the last 77 years. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3373.88s)]
*  In 1974. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3383.92s)]
*  And that was actually 74, 75. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3385.0s)]
*  It'll be the 50th anniversary this coming year of the Church Committee. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3388.44s)]
*  It was the only time that there was even a partial look inside what the CIA had been [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3393.92s)]
*  doing. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3402.96s)]
*  What they uncovered was a vipers nest of stupidity, evil, disaster, and of course, unbelievable [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3403.96s)]
*  unaccountability. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3417.0s)]
*  They uncovered, of course, numerous assassination plots. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3419.12s)]
*  They uncovered an absolutely shocking and awful program called MKUltra, which was a [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3424.6400000000003s)]
*  massive warped program for trying for mind control where they took innocent people, vagrants [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3436.6000000000004s)]
*  the streets of Times Square and shot them up with drugs or drove them to suicide through [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3446.8s)]
*  sleep deprivation. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3455.2400000000002s)]
*  Every kind of shocking thing you can't even make up and that made for great movie series [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3457.28s)]
*  like the Bourne series, which is about MKUltra in fact. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3462.9s)]
*  Now that was 1975. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3469.32s)]
*  We've gone 50 years of further secretive operations. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3473.2s)]
*  I've mentioned one of them, the timber sycamore, but that's one of many. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3481.48s)]
*  I've seen many myself by accident because I'm not in the security field. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3488.52s)]
*  I'm an economist, but I'm around lots of governments. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3494.04s)]
*  I'm all over the world. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3498.2s)]
*  I've seen coups with my own eyes. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3499.7599999999998s)]
*  I've seen the US role in these coups. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3501.76s)]
*  I've seen things that are absolutely disgusting, not because people are showing me secret documents. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3505.48s)]
*  I don't even want to see those, by the way. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3513.36s)]
*  I see them because I happen to be told or shown or walked around the Maidan soon after [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3515.76s)]
*  a coup overthrew Yanukovych. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3524.36s)]
*  People explain things to me which I found completely awful about American complicity [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3527.68s)]
*  in all of this. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3533.16s)]
*  I had a president in the Western Hemisphere say to me, Jeff, they're going to take me [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3534.96s)]
*  out. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3542.3999999999996s)]
*  I said, no, no, no, no, everything's going to be fine. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3543.68s)]
*  CIA took them out in broad daylight. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3547.6s)]
*  We have no review of any of this. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3552.98s)]
*  We have gone to war repeatedly on false pretenses. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3558.0s)]
*  We have gone to war repeatedly in so-called covert operations. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3563.1s)]
*  They're not covert to the people being affected. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3568.46s)]
*  But we just hear denials. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3572.42s)]
*  We hear stupidity from the New York Times, complete imbecility, childishness that they [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3575.52s)]
*  don't want to ask any single question. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3583.06s)]
*  What about the Maidan? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3585.92s)]
*  What was the US government doing there? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3588.18s)]
*  Well, it's easy enough to find out. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3590.84s)]
*  What were the decisions taken in overthrowing various regimes? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3595.3s)]
*  What about a number of assassinations that we have every forensic reason to know were [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3602.02s)]
*  conspiracies that the US never allowed to be understood? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3611.52s)]
*  Whether any of this is ever found, I don't know. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3616.88s)]
*  But if it is, it would change the course of America back to a true republic. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3619.5s)]
*  Because what happened in this country is that we were overtaken by the security state. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3625.78s)]
*  And we became a system of confidentiality and unaccountability. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3633.1400000000003s)]
*  And it's a big, massive machine. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3640.5800000000004s)]
*  And a lot of people are paid to keep quiet or to salute whatever the military industrial [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3644.46s)]
*  complex or the intelligence agencies are doing without asking questions. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3652.48s)]
*  Because when you have one and a half trillion dollars a year spent on that, you're a pretty [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3657.7400000000002s)]
*  big business. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3662.26s)]
*  And it has affected the universities, the think tanks, of course, the Congress, which [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3663.7s)]
*  ask no questions of any serious kind. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3669.86s)]
*  And so major, major events of fundamental significance for our insecurity take place [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3673.1s)]
*  without any truth telling at all. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3682.24s)]
*  So all of this is to say, it may be the most important thing that President Trump could [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3685.08s)]
*  do would be to open up the historical record so that we understand what has really happened. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3692.2799999999997s)]
*  Because we are 90 seconds to midnight. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3700.8799999999997s)]
*  We are closer to nuclear war than ever. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3703.3999999999996s)]
*  We have a military machine in the service of the Israel lobby or in the service of the [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3706.24s)]
*  military contractors or in the service of the deep state on its own or for whatever [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3712.4399999999996s)]
*  other crazy idea. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3719.24s)]
*  And we just don't have democratic deliberation or accountability about this. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3722.66s)]
*  But we could. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3730.18s)]
*  If we did, we would change the direction of this country. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3731.7999999999997s)]
*  For 35 years, Liberty Safe has been the number one manufacturer of safes made in this country, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3735.74s)]
*  American made from start to finish. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3741.8999999999996s)]
*  They make high quality gun safes. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3744.2599999999998s)]
*  I've got one. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3746.1s)]
*  Vault doors, home safes, handgun vaults, whatever you need to protect the things you value. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3747.3799999999997s)]

*  I use Liberty Safe's for the things that I don't want stolen, the things that really matter. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3756.1s)]

*  I'm not going to tell you what else, but you need one. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3765.7s)]
*  Prime rates are way up. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3768.1s)]
*  And if you have anything you would like to protect that you need to protect, Liberty [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3769.94s)]

*  With Liberty Safe, you are always protected. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3799.98s)]
*  Well the system is designed with accountability at the heart of it. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3802.82s)]
*  We have oversight committees in the House and the Senate that are supposed to be making [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3806.42s)]
*  intelligence community, the IC, is operating in accordance with the Constitution of the [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3812.86s)]
*  United States. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3817.34s)]
*  That's their job. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3818.34s)]
*  They don't, they obviously don't do their job, but what they do is very interesting. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3819.34s)]
*  Our system of government is actually rather ingenious. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3826.34s)]
*  It's ingenious because you can buy a piece of government at very low cost. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3831.1800000000003s)]
*  If the military industrial contractors just buy off a couple committees, that's enough [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3836.94s)]
*  because they're the only ones that have responsibility. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3843.06s)]
*  If the health insurers just buy off the health committees in the House and the Senate, that's [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3846.62s)]
*  enough. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3852.34s)]
*  If the Israel lobby just gets its hold on a couple of committees, they run American [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3853.58s)]
*  foreign policy in the Middle East. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3860.1s)]
*  So what I have found to be ingenious about our completely corrupted political system [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3862.2s)]
*  is how inexpensive it is to buy your corner of the story. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3868.08s)]
*  You don't control everything. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3874.3199999999997s)]
*  No one controls everything, but if you want to control health care, it's a couple committees. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3876.0s)]
*  If you want to control the military industrial machinery, that's just a couple of committees. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3881.3399999999997s)]
*  And so there is no oversight and there won't be oversight until there is public oversight. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3888.04s)]
*  Nobody oversees themselves and the idea that a few congressmen, and I know some of them, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3895.7799999999997s)]
*  that they're really constraining anything that the CIA or the intelligence community [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3902.62s)]
*  does, no way. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3911.4s)]
*  We've talked about it before. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3915.04s)]
*  Well, they're puppets of it. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3916.4s)]
*  Completely. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3918.1600000000003s)]
*  And they're funded. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3919.1600000000003s)]
*  They need some scrutiny. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3920.1600000000003s)]
*  They're funded by it. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3922.12s)]
*  They're puppets of it. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3923.92s)]
*  They're almost no independent members of our Congress. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3925.28s)]
*  Almost everyone is on the take. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3930.8s)]
*  Rand Paul is my one exception. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3932.92s)]
*  I think he's the most principled member of our Congress in both houses. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3934.6s)]
*  He really believes in honesty and small government and wants to know the truth. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3941.68s)]
*  I'll give an example of the complete lack of oversight and something we may know and [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3948.68s)]
*  something we talked about. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3956.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay, where did that pandemic come from? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3957.52s)]
*  The evidence is now overwhelming, though still not definitive, that it was made in a US lab. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3960.0s)]
*  This is overwhelming. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3968.0s)]
*  The report of the House committee that issued a report a couple of weeks ago says, yes, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3970.0s)]
*  there was obviously a lot of cover-up and a lot of unanswered questions and a lot of [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3977.16s)]
*  engagement of US scientists in this. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3983.2s)]
*  And we know that the US government lied up the wazoo on all of the question of the origin [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3985.8s)]
*  of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that made the pandemic, and has lied until today. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3993.72s)]
*  We know that the intelligence agencies know a lot that they haven't said. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=3999.46s)]
*  So this is another area. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4004.62s)]
*  Could we actually have some honesty? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4006.5s)]
*  Could we actually have some transparency? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4010.28s)]
*  Could we actually look at something where a pandemic took perhaps 20 million lives worldwide? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4012.94s)]
*  Where did that come from? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4019.94s)]
*  Especially since the evidence is now overwhelming that it was a laboratory creation with US [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4022.42s)]
*  scientists and US funding playing a huge role in this. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4029.1s)]
*  Do you think the new president will pardon Edward Snowden and Julian Assange? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4035.54s)]
*  Snowden is a remarkable person. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4042.22s)]
*  I don't know Julian Assange. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4043.94s)]
*  I do know Edward Snowden, and he is an absolutely remarkable person. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4045.54s)]
*  And yes, he is a hero because he told us what the government was actually doing towards [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4054.26s)]
*  us and of course the security state which really runs America therefore immediately [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4060.86s)]
*  branded him as the worst villain. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4068.84s)]
*  But we found out more from Snowden about the risk to our freedom than from just about anybody [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4071.26s)]
*  else. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4079.34s)]
*  And Julian Assange, you know, I almost every day I invoke a memorandum that he enabled [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4080.42s)]
*  me to see and you to see and all of us to see that explains the Ukraine war better than [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4092.26s)]
*  anything else. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4102.42s)]
*  And Julian Assange deserves all of the credit for this and it's also an interesting story [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4104.34s)]
*  if I may just say in one minute. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4111.06s)]
*  Our current CIA director, William Burns, in 2008 was the US ambassador to Russia. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4114.38s)]
*  And when he was US ambassador to Russia, he understood completely, perfectly that the [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4122.54s)]
*  The US push to expand NATO to Ukraine was disastrous, pure provocation, crossing Russia's [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4129.34s)]
*  red lines, likely to create a civil war inside Ukraine and a possible war between the United [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4138.860000000001s)]
*  States and Russia. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4146.42s)]
*  And he wrote a memo back to Condoleezza Rice, who is our Secretary of State. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4148.34s)]
*  And the memo said that the entire Russian political class opposes NATO enlargement and [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4157.02s)]
*  for real reasons. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4166.26s)]
*  And that memo famously became known as Nyet means Nyet, no means no, don't play games [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4168.620000000001s)]
*  with this. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4176.26s)]
*  This is real. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4177.26s)]
*  This is a red line. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4178.26s)]
*  Okay, something like this should be understood by the American people. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4179.42s)]
*  We've just spent around $200 billion, we've just caused deaths of perhaps six or 700,000 [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4184.7s)]
*  Ukrainians on completely false pretenses, on false pretenses that as the New York Times [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4193.82s)]
*  has wrongly stated unendingly, that the war in Ukraine was quote, unprovoked. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4200.9s)]
*  Not only was it provoked, the US provoked it, and not only that, our senior diplomats [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4208.5s)]
*  knew that, knew that at the time and wrote about it. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4215.06s)]
*  Now this memo makes this perfectly clear. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4219.18s)]
*  Anyone can go online and type William Burns Nyet means Nyet cable, and you will come up [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4222.62s)]
*  with this cable and then you can read why in 2008 we knew that the deep state push for [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4228.66s)]
*  NATO enlargement was mind bendingly stupid, dangerous, provocative and likely to get us [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4236.14s)]
*  into disaster, which it did. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4244.860000000001s)]
*  How do we even see that memo? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4247.900000000001s)]
*  Do you think that a congressional committee called Condoleezza Rice and said, could we [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4249.9800000000005s)]
*  have the documentary evidence to understand the choices you're making? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4255.38s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4259.54s)]
*  There's no oversight when it comes to security issues. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4260.54s)]
*  We are already in a security state that has no resemblance to democracy whatsoever, but [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4264.54s)]
*  Julian Assange enabled us to see it. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4272.3s)]
*  So we have to express gratitude for that. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4276.7s)]
*  This is the truth. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4281.26s)]
*  If you don't want leaks, don't have a world run where every consequential fact is hidden [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4282.82s)]
*  from the American people and it enables one disaster after another. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4290.34s)]
*  And just to make clear how disastrous this is, Bill Clinton, who was in my view a completely [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4295.3s)]
*  ineffectual president and a long list of ineffectual presidents, came to office in 1993 when the [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4303.46s)]
*  doomsday clock was at 17 minutes from midnight, meaning that it was the farthest away from [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4311.34s)]
*  nuclear war in the whole history of the nuclear age. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4319.3s)]
*  Every single president starting with Clinton brought the doomsday clock closer to Armageddon. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4324.86s)]
*  So we went from 17 minutes to midnight to 90 seconds to midnight with no accountability [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4331.62s)]
*  or explanation at all. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4338.46s)]
*  Do you think it's fair to say that anyone who opposes pardons for Ed Snowden and Julian [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4341.5s)]
*  Assange should be looked at with suspicion, or is actually an enemy of the country? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4347.3s)]
*  Well I think that they may just be ignorant or don't understand, or maybe they're New [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4354.5s)]
*  York Times readers. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4359.02s)]
*  In other words, there are a lot of people who really don't understand the situation [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4361.18s)]
*  right now, don't understand how dangerous it is, don't understand how lawless it is, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4368.26s)]
*  don't understand how we're driven by these long term aims that are absolutely disastrous. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4373.9800000000005s)]
*  I thank Mitch McConnell, by the way, for writing his essay that the goal is primacy. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4382.3s)]
*  Too late. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4389.78s)]
*  If our goal is primacy, and we pursue that like this octogenarian who can barely function [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4391.26s)]
*  anymore says we should, we'll all get blown up. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4398.46s)]
*  We'll move from 90 seconds to midnight to 60 seconds to midnight to 30 seconds to midnight [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4402.22s)]
*  and goodbye. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4407.18s)]
*  Because we can't have a world where the United States says we're in charge of everything. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4408.78s)]
*  If you aim that way, we will end up with World War III that will not go well. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4414.5s)]
*  We're begging South Korea for munitions, so the truth is we don't have the power to affect [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4421.98s)]
*  that anyway. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4426.02s)]
*  But you know, this is the interesting thing. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4427.7s)]
*  Already you could know back in 2014, don't overthrow the Ukrainian government, you could [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4432.58s)]
*  know in 2015, honor the Minsk agreement that would end the war. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4440.1s)]
*  You could know in 2021, negotiate with Russia because actually Ukraine, I won't even say [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4447.1s)]
*  Ukraine, the United States cannot win a war in Ukraine against Russia. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4455.42s)]
*  We knew that, but these are not clever people. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4460.66s)]
*  Jake Sullivan is not a clever person. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4466.62s)]
*  They don't understand, they're like terrible poker players that somehow are sitting at [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4469.86s)]
*  the grand slam of poker, they don't know what they're doing. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4476.7s)]
*  And they're bluffing and they're betting and they're doubling down with our money, by the [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4479.98s)]
*  way. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4483.94s)]
*  And so yes, you could know this primacy thing. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4485.94s)]
*  Come on, what does it even mean in a world of multiple nuclear superpowers? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4491.46s)]
*  What does it even mean? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4497.9s)]
*  It means we just ignore all of that till we're all blown to smithereens? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4499.82s)]
*  No, but Mitch McConnell's barely functions anymore, but he's got the big story in foreign [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4504.82s)]
*  affairs about how we need to preserve primacy. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4512.419999999999s)]
*  So there's a lot of momentum and ignorance and deep state arrogance. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4515.58s)]
*  Who the hell are you to tell us you don't even read the secret files? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4523.66s)]
*  This is really where we have been for a very long time. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4528.7s)]
*  Since 1991, the deep state, the CIA and others have been trying to defeat Russia. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4534.1s)]
*  Since 1991, Netanyahu's been with American military, remaking the Middle East. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4542.02s)]
*  It's been a disaster on both fronts. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4550.1s)]
*  It's made America drastically less secure. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4552.700000000001s)]
*  But they continue this group in power and there's a chance that President Trump could [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4557.54s)]
*  change this. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4564.700000000001s)]
*  He's got a completely divided team and he's got a completely divided landscape in Washington. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4566.22s)]
*  And I think he knows the deep state is not going out with a whimper. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4582.98s)]
*  It's going to fight for its prerogatives. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4591.3s)]
*  Are people you know worried about a terror attack in the U.S.? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4593.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4598.299999999999s)]
*  They don't tell me and I'm frankly myself more worried about World War III. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4599.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4607.139999999999s)]
*  So you said the president has assembled a divided team. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4608.36s)]
*  One person who I think is pretty close to his stated objectives on foreign policy is [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4611.5s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4616.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4617.82s)]
*  He's nominated to be director of national intelligence. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4618.82s)]
*  The entire Senate Intel Committee appears to be against her. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4621.9s)]
*  I think every member. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4625.259999999999s)]
*  And that shows that she is completely on the right side. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4626.299999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4629.94s)]
*  Do you think she'll make it? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4632.099999999999s)]
*  How important is it that she make it? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4632.98s)]
*  She's probably, and I don't want to jinx anything, she's probably the most important appointment [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4636.139999999999s)]
*  of the Trump administration. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4640.379999999999s)]
*  It does seem that way. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4642.139999999999s)]
*  She is incredibly intelligent, incredibly honest, incredibly committed to U.S. security. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4643.379999999999s)]
*  And would do a superb job. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4651.38s)]
*  So, that's why she's being opposed. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4656.38s)]
*  Because the forces that are worse than mediocre, that are right now on top of a $1.5 trillion [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4660.18s)]
*  a year machine that have been running disastrous wars, that have been bringing us closer and [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4671.9800000000005s)]
*  closer to doom, don't want any accountability. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4678.82s)]
*  And what Tulsi Gabbard would represent is competence, honesty, forthrightness, and not [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4684.219999999999s)]
*  having been a party to all these failures. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4694.179999999999s)]
*  So if you're the incoming administration, how hard do you fight for her nomination? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4697.46s)]
*  Well, she's critical. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4701.62s)]
*  Because this is the most important question facing the United States today. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4703.9s)]
*  We have many important questions. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4709.799999999999s)]
*  We have major financial, social, political, economic, institutional questions. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4711.58s)]
*  But the most important question facing us is, is a country that potentially is more secure [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4719.299999999999s)]
*  than any country in the history of the world going to do itself in by a self-provoked World [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4725.58s)]
*  War III? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4732.74s)]
*  And we're on that course. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4734.22s)]
*  And five presidents have been on that course through their incompetence and their obedience [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4736.18s)]
*  to an unaccountable deep state. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4742.46s)]
*  And President Trump is coming in saying that he's going to change direction. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4746.0599999999995s)]
*  He says every day that he wants to be president of peace. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4751.72s)]
*  By the way, I think the greatest thing that could happen is four Nobel Peace Prizes for [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4757.26s)]
*  President Trump. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4761.86s)]
*  He could end the war in Ukraine. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4762.82s)]
*  He could end the war in the Middle East, not by bombing Iran. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4764.74s)]
*  That would do the opposite, but by enabling a two-state solution in the Middle East, and [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4768.16s)]
*  the wars would all end. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4775.16s)]
*  He could end the talk of the war in East Asia, which would be the utter disaster and folly [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4776.9s)]
*  by recognizing that we shouldn't be meddling in China's internal affairs, and Taiwan is [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4784.9s)]
*  an internal affair of China. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4791.9s)]
*  And he should be restoring a framework of nuclear arms control. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4794.9s)]
*  I give him four Nobel Peace Prizes for that. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4801.9s)]
*  If he chooses that direction, he'll be the most consequential president in our modern [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4805.5s)]
*  history, perhaps in our history, because he will reestablish security for the American [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4811.5s)]
*  people. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4815.5s)]
*  If he follows the hardliners, he's just going to add yet another years of bringing us closer [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4816.5s)]
*  to doom. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4824.5s)]
*  How is the Ukraine War settled? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4825.5s)]
*  The Ukraine War is settled literally in one call, just as he says, because all he has [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4828.5s)]
*  to do, really all he has to do, is pick up the phone and call President Putin and say, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4835.02s)]
*  you know, that 30-year effort to expand NATO to Ukraine and to Georgia was ridiculous, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4842.66s)]
*  unacceptable, unnecessary provocation, and it's led us to this juncture. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4853.82s)]
*  I'm against it. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4861.82s)]
*  I'm going to say it publicly. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4863.0599999999995s)]
*  We're going to end this adventurism, and you stop fighting today. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4865.259999999999s)]
*  And the fighting will stop that moment, actually. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4869.7s)]
*  Then there will be details, and the details are where the borders will be drawn exactly. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4873.34s)]
*  But the war will end. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4881.58s)]
*  The war will not end, by the way, by saying, let's have a ceasefire. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4883.74s)]
*  That's a meaningless statement, as you heard repeatedly from Foreign Minister Lavrov, and [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4888.9s)]
*  as I know and as anyone thinking about this knows, this isn't about a ceasefire. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4895.58s)]
*  This is about a cause of this war. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4902.38s)]
*  And the cause of this war is that Russia does not want the U.S. and its missile systems [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4905.28s)]
*  on its 1,200-kilometer border with Ukraine right now. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4911.5s)]
*  And Biden was so stupid, and I'm using the term, of course it sounds, I don't know how [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4918.74s)]
*  it sounds, but it's true, that he couldn't say that and avoid the war. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4924.98s)]
*  That was obvious how to avoid this war. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4930.22s)]
*  Obvious how to avoid this war. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4933.78s)]
*  But Biden couldn't do it. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4935.8s)]
*  That's why I say he's been such a terrible president. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4939.42s)]
*  And I think that President Trump wants to do it this way. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4943.22s)]
*  Now again, he's got people around him of many different views. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4948.14s)]
*  Some say, promise him, just ask for a ceasefire, freeze the conflict. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4954.46s)]
*  Armistice, Korean solution, 1953. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4960.38s)]
*  This is completely beside the point. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4964.280000000001s)]
*  Russia isn't going to freeze the conflict, it's actually winning on the ground. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4967.5s)]
*  But why is it fighting? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4971.34s)]
*  Because it does not want this regime, which was installed by the United States in 2014, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4973.339999999999s)]
*  to have U.S. bases, NATO, U.S. weapons and missile systems on its border. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4980.58s)]
*  And the fact that Biden just proved the point by saying, yeah, we'll fire the missiles into [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4990.16s)]
*  Russia, make it all the more clear why they're concerned about this. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4994.62s)]
*  This isn't an idle threat. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=4998.7s)]
*  This isn't some dumb thing. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5000.179999999999s)]
*  They're being hit right now by U.S. missile systems, by U.S. personnel firing these missile [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5002.34s)]
*  systems. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5011.42s)]
*  So it's not an idle threat. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5012.42s)]
*  So people who say freeze the conflict, they don't get it. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5013.96s)]
*  People who say, and there was an initial statement, NATO will not enlarge for at least X years. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5017.860000000001s)]
*  Somebody said 10 years, somebody said 20 years. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5028.8s)]
*  This is also completely ridiculous. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5031.18s)]
*  Then another idea. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5034.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, we'll give Russia this territory, Donetsk and Lugansk and maybe Hrson and Zaporizhzhya [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5036.26s)]
*  and Crimea, but all the rest of Ukraine will be part of NATO. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5044.18s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5049.14s)]
*  It's the same deal. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5050.14s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5051.54s)]
*  So if you understand what this is about, where it came from, why it continues to this moment, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5053.1s)]
*  there is one phone call that ends it, which is get to the underlying cause of the war. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5060.46s)]
*  The underlying cause of the war, going back to a decision that Bill Clinton made in 1994, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5067.74s)]
*  is the decision to expand NATO to Ukraine. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5074.82s)]
*  And by the way, they want to expand it to the South Caucasus, to Georgia, which is also [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5079.42s)]
*  in turmoil right now. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5083.9s)]
*  It's very interesting, Tucker, that Zbigniew Brzezinski spelled this out to the letter [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5085.78s)]
*  in 1997. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5095.58s)]
*  And it's fascinating to read his account. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5098.099999999999s)]
*  All wrong. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5102.5s)]
*  He got it completely wrong, but he spelled it out. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5104.24s)]
*  And what he said was in his book, The Grand Chessboard in 1997, we should expand NATO [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5108.98s)]
*  eastward. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5119.419999999999s)]
*  We should expand Europe eastward. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5120.419999999999s)]
*  And we should ask the question, what will Russia do? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5123.259999999999s)]
*  Russia won't like it. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5127.78s)]
*  So Brzezinski spends a whole chapter, what will Russia do? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5129.4s)]
*  And he asks the question, well, could Russia ever align with China? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5133.84s)]
*  Nope, that's not going to happen. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5138.6s)]
*  Could Russia ever align with Iran? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5141.8s)]
*  Nope, that's not going to happen. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5144.12s)]
*  Russia's only choice is to accede to the US action. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5146.92s)]
*  So in 1997, it was perfectly clearly understood. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5153.4400000000005s)]
*  What is the strategy? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5159.0s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5160.6s)]
*  And what will happen? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5162.16s)]
*  The only problem is it was wrong. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5163.92s)]
*  This is the only problem. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5166.5199999999995s)]
*  He got it completely wrong. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5167.78s)]
*  And you can go back to his credit. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5170.12s)]
*  He wrote his prediction. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5172.5599999999995s)]
*  It's wrong. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5174.42s)]
*  But why are we still playing that game until today? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5175.76s)]
*  Why did Biden exactly continue on that failed course? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5179.44s)]
*  Because he's a failure. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5185.36s)]
*  That's why. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5187.28s)]
*  Because he didn't understand. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5188.28s)]
*  Because he's surrounded by mediocrities at best. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5190.139999999999s)]
*  The Biden administration has tried to kill Vladimir Putin. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5194.419999999999s)]
*  That's a fact, I think. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5197.74s)]
*  And they funded separatist groups within Russia, probably going back before Biden. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5200.0s)]
*  Well, this has been, by the way, CIA ops to have separatist groups everywhere. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5204.94s)]
*  And it's fascinating, just if I could mention, because it's almost humorous, except that [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5211.98s)]
*  it's so tragic. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5217.959999999999s)]
*  There was a, I don't remember the exact name, but something around 1998 called the Chechnya [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5219.82s)]
*  Friendship Committee. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5226.219999999999s)]
*  Chechnya, okay. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5227.86s)]
*  Burning issue for the United States? [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5229.9s)]
*  I dare one in a million of your listeners to know exactly where Chechnya is in its history, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5231.78s)]
*  because who knows who cares? [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5237.259999999999s)]
*  But if you look at the Chechnya Friendship Committee, it was the blue ribbon committee [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5238.98s)]
*  of American neocons. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5244.46s)]
*  Big Brzezinski right there. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5247.179999999999s)]
*  Everyone that wants the hard line. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5249.74s)]
*  Why? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5252.0599999999995s)]
*  They couldn't care for one iota of a moment about Chechnya. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5253.0599999999995s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5260.86s)]
*  They wanted to break up Russia. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5262.179999999999s)]
*  Everything is antagonism. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5265.22s)]
*  So they fund Islamic extremism. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5266.7s)]
*  So they funded the jihadists everywhere. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5268.46s)]
*  And by the way, it's not even, it's, we made Al-Qaeda, I think everyone understands this. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5271.7s)]
*  We made Osama bin Laden. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5277.86s)]
*  We made this, the overthrow in Syria where they're saying, oh my God, it's HTS. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5280.0599999999995s)]
*  Why do you think this was what Obama tasked in 2011-12? [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5288.139999999999s)]
*  Jihadists. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5294.099999999999s)]
*  So what would happen if they succeeded in killing Putin? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5296.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, what, I don't understand why that would be in America's interest to have 6,000 [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5300.099999999999s)]
*  nuclear warheads unsecured floating around in a country that's 20% Muslim and very complicated [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5308.099999999999s)]
*  and like, that seems like the last thing that you would ever want to do. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5313.78s)]
*  When he's the most pro-Western leader in Russia. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5317.38s)]
*  Let me address it in a little bit different way. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5321.62s)]
*  In the last year, the leaders of Hamas wanted to make peace with Israel and their political [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5326.0599999999995s)]
*  negotiator was a man named Haneeah. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5337.700000000001s)]
*  What did Israel do when the peace feelers came out? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5342.06s)]
*  They assassinated him to make sure that there would be no attempt by Hamas to make peace. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5345.42s)]
*  Nasrullah of Hezbollah. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5354.02s)]
*  For real? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5357.14s)]
*  For real. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5358.42s)]
*  That he's the one that they killed at the inauguration of Hezbollah. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5359.42s)]
*  Yes, I remember, but that was after. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5363.26s)]
*  He was the political negotiator for Hamas and they wanted to try to find a peace. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5364.58s)]
*  Israel hates the idea that there would be negotiations with Hamas. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5371.860000000001s)]
*  The idea is to remake the Middle East through war, not through a peaceful negotiation. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5378.42s)]
*  Then Nasrullah in Hezbollah wanted to make peace with Israel. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5385.78s)]
*  What did they do? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5396.259999999999s)]
*  They killed him, of course. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5398.259999999999s)]
*  This is a basic point. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5401.94s)]
*  Kill the peacemakers. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5403.94s)]
*  This is very important to understand. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5406.58s)]
*  You assassinate the people that might want to negotiate. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5408.98s)]
*  And we... [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5414.18s)]
*  This was something that JFK learned, I think, the hard way. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5415.78s)]
*  Well, this is the modus operandi of the CIA, and it's the modus operandi of Mossad, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5418.74s)]
*  and it's the modus operandi of this deep state, which is you're not aiming for peace. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5427.06s)]
*  You're aiming for primacy. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5435.46s)]
*  You're aiming for dominance. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5437.94s)]
*  You're aiming to remake the region in your image. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5439.38s)]
*  You're resisting any call for compromise. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5442.74s)]
*  Yitzhak Rabin, when he wanted to make peace, he was assassinated. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5448.099999999999s)]
*  Kill the peacemakers. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5453.46s)]
*  But what we know is that this is state action. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5455.46s)]
*  We know this in the United States. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5460.179999999999s)]
*  Kill the peacemakers. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5462.5s)]
*  We know it of Mossad. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5464.0199999999995s)]
*  Rise and kill. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5465.7s)]
*  And they've done it repeatedly in front of our eyes. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5467.219999999999s)]
*  So it's not the harshest enemy you try to kill. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5470.58s)]
*  It's the one that threatens you not with war, but with diplomacy. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5474.0199999999995s)]
*  That's what they dislike. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5480.9s)]
*  They don't want peace. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5482.26s)]
*  They want primacy. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5483.7s)]
*  This is really a different thing. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5485.3s)]
*  Where is it getting us? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5487.38s)]
*  Since the whole thing is completely delusional, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5488.98s)]
*  it's getting us closer and closer to nuclear annihilation. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5491.94s)]
*  How could anyone think you'd kill the president of a nuclear [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5496.82s)]
*  superpower? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5500.5s)]
*  Of course, it's the most mind-boggling, wrongheaded idea. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5501.78s)]
*  I have no information about that. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5508.26s)]
*  What I do have information about is the ones that they actually kill. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5510.74s)]
*  By the way, I also know through lots of discussions, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5514.82s)]
*  and I can't go into all of them because I just have been lucky to have [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5520.66s)]
*  fascinating discussions. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5527.46s)]
*  Iran has been asking for peace and for reaching out to the Biden [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5531.3s)]
*  administration for the last two years. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5537.22s)]
*  How do we take that? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5541.14s)]
*  Oh, they must be vulnerable. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5542.9s)]
*  Now we must kill them. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5545.7s)]
*  That's the idea. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5547.38s)]
*  It's so weird. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5548.5s)]
*  Iran is reaching out for peace now? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5549.54s)]
*  Iran has been for two years. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5551.94s)]
*  There have been... [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5554.099999999999s)]
*  I talked to an intermediary recently. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5555.38s)]
*  I've talked to many diplomats in the last... [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5557.46s)]
*  In most recent months. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5561.38s)]
*  By the way, there's an astoundingly... [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5563.38s)]
*  Oh, my God, an astoundingly insightful episode that was reposted of PBS [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5567.7s)]
*  NewsHour with Robert McNeil interviewing Henry Kissinger and Jack Matlock in 1994. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5575.62s)]
*  This is the 30th anniversary of this show. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5585.94s)]
*  The show was on NATO enlargement. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5590.42s)]
*  Matlock, who was the US ambassador to the Soviet Union and a wonderful diplomat [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5594.34s)]
*  and a very, very smart, fine man was saying in 1994, don't provoke. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5600.82s)]
*  We have peace now. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5608.099999999999s)]
*  Don't expand NATO. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5609.54s)]
*  We've said we won't. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5610.98s)]
*  We shouldn't. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5612.5s)]
*  And if Russia ever becomes belligerent again, of course, we would reconsider and take action. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5613.219999999999s)]
*  But right now, there's no belligerency. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5619.7s)]
*  There's no reason to provoke. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5622.099999999999s)]
*  Kissinger is incoherent, actually, which is unusual. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5624.9s)]
*  But Robert McNeil kind of can't even fathom what Kissinger is saying until Kissinger [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5634.0199999999995s)]
*  finally stumbles out with the statement. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5641.78s)]
*  And I won't get it exactly right, but he says something to the effect. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5645.219999999999s)]
*  If you can't provoke Russia when they're weak, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5649.46s)]
*  how are we going to provoke them when they're strong? [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5652.82s)]
*  And it's just such a weird idea that there's no moment when you could actually try to make [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5655.94s)]
*  peace because if they're weak, definitely don't make peace because if you try not to [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5662.58s)]
*  provoke them then, well, then you won't be credible when they're strong. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5667.46s)]
*  And so the idea is you always must be aggressive. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5671.38s)]
*  So Kissinger was saying in 1994, of course, we need to expand NATO. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5674.58s)]
*  And yes, Russia won't like it, but they're weak now so they can't resist. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5679.94s)]
*  Later on, by the way, he came to understand that expanding NATO to Ukraine was just too far. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5684.74s)]
*  He actually did reach that understanding in 2015. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5691.299999999999s)]
*  But watching him in 2004 is very interesting because 2004 was the year that the decision [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5694.98s)]
*  was made. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5702.82s)]
*  And this is also something very important to understand about our foreign policy. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5703.86s)]
*  It's not that a president comes in and then we have a new foreign policy and then another [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5708.580000000001s)]
*  president, we have a new foreign policy. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5713.700000000001s)]
*  These things are very deeply set courses. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5715.3s)]
*  These wars in the Middle East go back 30 years. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5719.620000000001s)]
*  This war against Russia actually goes back to 1945 at the end of World War II, but in [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5722.900000000001s)]
*  the current version goes back to 1991 and by plan to 1994 when Clinton laid out the [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5731.46s)]
*  NATO enlargement and then Brzezinski spelled it out for the public in 1997, but it was [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5740.66s)]
*  decisions already taken. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5747.7s)]
*  So we can watch Kissinger in 1994 explaining, yeah, Russia's weak, take advantage of them. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5749.78s)]
*  This is the time to take advantage of them. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5757.14s)]
*  This is what gets us into such unbelievable insecurity. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5759.3s)]
*  We could be the safest people in the world in history. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5763.9400000000005s)]
*  No one could conceivably attack us. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5767.860000000001s)]
*  And yet we're 90 seconds to midnight. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5770.26s)]
*  Do you have any expectation that will change? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5775.14s)]
*  I'm counting on President Trump to change this. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5777.7s)]
*  I think his instinct is right. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5781.62s)]
*  I think his sense is right. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5784.900000000001s)]
*  I think he doesn't like war. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5787.06s)]
*  I really do. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5789.22s)]
*  Oh, he doesn't. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5790.98s)]
*  He displayed that in the first term and he said that repeatedly now. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5792.26s)]
*  This is the best thing we have going for us. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5798.74s)]
*  Now, in his first term, he hired a lot of very irresponsible people that like war or [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5801.78s)]
*  like duplicity or that like the deep state or that like accountability, unaccountability, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5811.219999999999s)]
*  like John Bolton, one of my least favorites among all of these. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5818.66s)]
*  Fair. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5823.78s)]
*  And Trump hired them. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5825.94s)]
*  So the question now is probably not his deep sense, which I think is absolutely right, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5827.7s)]
*  but now his tactical sense inside the US government. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5837.54s)]
*  Please don't let the deep state continue on a path that it's been on. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5842.82s)]
*  And don't let the normal hardliners because Washington is filled with people who have been [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5848.339999999999s)]
*  on the payroll of the military industrial complex their whole careers. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5854.82s)]
*  Don't let them dominate policy. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5860.74s)]
*  And the incoming administration is such a mix right now. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5863.780000000001s)]
*  And we see that the clarity of those who want to control this, how hard they're being, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5870.66s)]
*  how harshly they're being opposed like Tulsi Gabbard or let me say Bobby Kennedy, though, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5880.58s)]
*  his department is health, but he understands this peace side as well very clearly. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5887.780000000001s)]
*  These are the ones that they're fighting because we've been for, I'd say, again, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5896.42s)]
*  30 years at least and arguably basically 80 years since the end of World War II on a particular [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5902.740000000001s)]
*  jag, which at least Mitch McConnell does us the service of naming by its name, which is primacy. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5912.02s)]
*  And if we continue on that course, Trump will fail and the United States will be gravely [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5919.780000000001s)]
*  endangered. And if he reverses that course, he stands to be a great and historic president. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5925.860000000001s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5932.580000000001s)]
*  Because there's so much at stake, you sort of wonder what the people who oppose that kind of [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5933.540000000001s)]
*  reform would do. The national security state has been willing eager to use violence abroad [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5937.78s)]
*  again and again and again, murdering people. As I said, trying to murder Putin. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5943.219999999999s)]
*  Would they or are you concerned that they would be willing to use that domestically? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5949.0599999999995s)]
*  John O'Brien [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5952.9s)]
*  I think there's no doubt that they've used assassinations at home. I'm of the view that [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5953.7s)]
*  JFK was the first clear case of that at home. This is a long, long story. Some people roll [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5959.86s)]
*  their eyes at it, but I've spent much of my life reading, studying, examining this. I think it's [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5969.86s)]
*  quite arguable for Bobby Kennedy the same way. And I don't think that there have been scruples [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5979.0599999999995s)]
*  inside about keeping prerogatives. At the same time, the situation is better now in one regard. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5986.42s)]
*  30 years of failure. So it's not as if the course that we're on is giving us these great benefits. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=5999.0599999999995s)]
*  The United States needs to change course for our own security. We need to change course for our [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6009.62s)]
*  own finances. We're not in good shape in this country. When 75% or so of Americans repeatedly [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6017.62s)]
*  say America's on the wrong track, they're correct at that. And they say that now. That's the latest [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6027.86s)]
*  Gallup findings. And they're completely right. So this is not the exuberance, and I would say the [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6036.02s)]
*  hubris of 1991. And I was there then as an economic specialist and an advisor, unpaid and informal, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6046.1s)]
*  but an advisor to President Gorbachev and an advisor to President Yeltsin and an advisor to [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6059.38s)]
*  Ukraine's President Kuchma on how to stabilize their desperately destabilized economies and how [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6064.98s)]
*  to move to market systems. And the United States was not interested in peace. We had this hubris [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6073.139999999999s)]
*  that history had ended. We had won, and now America would run the show. The difference today is that [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6084.419999999999s)]
*  we're 33 years after the end of the Soviet Union. We tried the neocon approach for 30 years now. We [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6093.22s)]
*  have engaged in all of Netanyahu's wars. We went to war in Ukraine. Everything that was predicted [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6103.3s)]
*  has been proved wrong. The neocons failed time and again. They didn't remake Afghanistan. They [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6112.74s)]
*  didn't remake Iraq. They did not remake the Middle East. They did not call Putin's bluff and [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6121.78s)]
*  enter Ukraine with NATO. They did not enter Georgia with NATO. They completely misjudged [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6131.0599999999995s)]
*  how we would push the rest of the world into unity, as I mentioned with Big Brzezinski, saying Russia [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6142.9s)]
*  will never side with China on this. Well, of course, he got wrong the most fundamental [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6150.42s)]
*  diplomatic change of our age, the rise of China and the creation of a group that does not want [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6157.38s)]
*  U.S. hegemony and a group that is increasingly integrated in production and military and security [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6165.22s)]
*  and diplomacy. So we are at a time where the failures are self-evident if people open their [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6173.54s)]
*  eyes and the American people know it, in fact. So it's not even convincing the American people, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6182.5s)]
*  oh, it's worse than you think. No, they know. They want their own problems solved. How about [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6187.3s)]
*  jobs, some housing, reduce crime in my neighborhood, keep the inflation down? Could you keep the debt [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6195.14s)]
*  from destroying American public finances? They're not interested in Mitch McConnell's [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6201.78s)]
*  primacy continuing. He's an octogenarian go, done, you're done. It's time for something different. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6207.94s)]
*  So in this sense, it's really possible for this administration, this incoming administration to [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6215.86s)]
*  change course because it doesn't require a massive public education. It requires honesty. It [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6223.3s)]
*  requires seeing down the deep state internally. It requires making sure that the key appointments [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6231.62s)]
*  that want competence, honesty, and security for America actually get the job. And of course, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6239.46s)]
*  it requires President Trump following through on his profound main insight, which is that there is [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6246.9s)]
*  no reason for war with Russia. There's no reason for war with China. And I want him really to know, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6256.42s)]
*  really to know there's no reason for war with Iran. None. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6264.34s)]
*  But every week, every day, Fox News tells me that there's some assassination attempt by Iran. They're [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6268.66s)]
*  sending drones from their ships offshore over our country to scope it out for future attacks. I mean, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6276.9800000000005s)]
*  Iran is presented in the US media as the aggressor, trying to kill Trump, for example. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6283.62s)]
*  I don't know if those Fox reporters have the chance to speak with the Iranian senior officials or [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6291.3s)]
*  Oh, well, that's not allowed. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6298.58s)]
*  Middle East officials. I do. I do all the time. I am able to ask questions, to check facts, to [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6299.62s)]
*  understand circumstances. I speak to lots of people engaged all over the Middle East on these [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6309.86s)]
*  questions, and it's simply not true. So the first thing one should do, period, in this world, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6317.94s)]
*  is talk to the other side. And if Donald Trump has that, this would be the farthest reach, [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6326.34s)]
*  but if he has that impulse with Iran, too, he will be perhaps amazed, perhaps gratified, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6336.58s)]
*  but he would do a huge service for the American people. Huge service for the American people. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6344.98s)]
*  My sense is that a war with Iran feels inevitable. I'm obviously opposed to it, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6350.82s)]
*  but tell us how you think that would go if it happens. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6358.9s)]
*  There's nothing inevitable till it happens. So this is extremely important. A war with Iran [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6361.7s)]
*  will be World War III. So that's the point. Iran is not alone, and it will not remain alone. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6371.22s)]
*  And so if we go to war with Iran, we are expanding the war with Russia. With Russia, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6380.98s)]
*  we are at a possibility of peace, but we're also at a possibility of nuclear war. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6388.740000000001s)]
*  They're both very close. And if we go to war with Iran, we make the war, nuclear war, all the more [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6395.38s)]
*  likely. Do you think that the people pushing us toward war with Iran understand that? [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6403.06s)]
*  No. No, I think that they're following a plan, Clean Break, 1996, and a plan, 1991, [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6412.5s)]
*  seven wars in five years, that has been deep set and that has been Netanyahu's baby all the time. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6424.02s)]
*  Netanyahu, I regard, is one of the most delusional and dangerous people on the planet, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6433.22s)]
*  and he has engaged the United States so far in six disastrous wars, and he's aiming to engage us in [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6440.02s)]
*  yet one more. But Netanyahu's track record is just about the worst of any person on the planet right [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6448.02s)]
*  now in terms of damage done, and we should be able to understand that. And we have a lot of [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6457.7s)]
*  rhetoric in this country standing up for Israel. We're not standing up for Israel. We are engaging [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6464.1s)]
*  in war on Israel's behalf all over the Middle East. That's a completely different thing. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6470.740000000001s)]
*  I believe in Israel's security alongside a state of Palestine, which I know completely to be [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6477.860000000001s)]
*  possible and achievable and peaceful and ending this risk of World War III and could have prevented [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6487.46s)]
*  the million or so deaths that have come from Netanyahu's wars up until now. And the Arab states [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6496.34s)]
*  have been saying this repeatedly since 2002. It's called the Arab Peace Initiative. Anybody can look [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6503.46s)]
*  it up. They repeat it basically nonstop in the last two years. The Iranians want peace. I know [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6509.86s)]
*  that as well. And so the whole game is to make claims about the other side and to say if you [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6519.219999999999s)]
*  talk to the other side, oh, you're a traitor. That's what they say about Tulsi Gabbard. She [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6527.54s)]
*  talked to Assad. Well, what about that? Isn't that amazing? But I just, again, just to refer back to [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6532.9s)]
*  the core of it, I don't understand when Assad became our enemy and why and why should I go [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6539.46s)]
*  along with that? It was almost a flip because there were nice words said about him by Hillary [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6544.74s)]
*  Clinton one year and then the next year exactly the opposite because these are mind games that [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6550.66s)]
*  are played for reasons that are not said directly. And that have no bearing on American national [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6556.9s)]
*  security or aren't motivated by a desire to protect the United States. There's nothing to do [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6564.26s)]
*  with that. Of course not. Nothing that has happened in the Middle East has been for [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6567.62s)]
*  American national security. None of it. Not one of these wars. These have been Netanyahu's wars. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6573.14s)]
*  Watch him cheerily. Why does, I mean, it's just amazing how few Americans, many Americans love [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6579.86s)]
*  their country and willing to lay down their lives for it in half. But how few are willing to say [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6587.14s)]
*  what you've just said? Because they're told repeatedly the opposite and you can be told [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6592.34s)]
*  anything can be sold even not that people believe it by the way, but they don't hear [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6600.58s)]
*  the correct story anywhere in the mainstream. They hear things that don't quite make sense to them. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6607.38s)]
*  And by the way, this is one of the points of infowar. The public didn't believe the official [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6614.26s)]
*  narrative about JFK's assassination. The public didn't believe the official narrative about RFK's [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6621.38s)]
*  assassination. The public didn't believe the official narrative about COVID. The public [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6627.46s)]
*  didn't believe the official narrative about Iraq. The public doesn't believe these things, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6633.3s)]
*  but it doesn't hear the coherent explanation from the New York Times or MSNBC or CNN or [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6639.14s)]
*  anybody else. No one actually tries to explain. And so what hangs out there is something completely [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6648.02s)]
*  unsatisfactory, but it doesn't have an alternative explanation. And if you don't have the clarity of [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6656.26s)]
*  the alternative, then this miserable phony infowar approach, it fills the space and they're not [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6666.02s)]
*  interested in convincing us because we don't have any say in any of these issues. They're [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6676.02s)]
*  interested in doing what they want to do without being stopped. That's the difference. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6681.780000000001s)]
*  When was the last time you appeared or wrote for a mainstream publication or television channel here? [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6687.700000000001s)]
*  It was the day that I was on Bloomberg and I said the US blew up Nord Stream. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6694.1s)]
*  I remember that and they cut you off. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6701.54s)]
*  And they cut me off and then berated me for several minutes while I was watching on the screen, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6703.7s)]
*  but cut off. And that was the last moment. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6710.82s)]
*  But the US did blow up Nord Stream. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6713.139999999999s)]
*  Pardon me? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6714.82s)]
*  You were telling the truth. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6715.299999999999s)]
*  Of course. And exactly who did it when is something that would be easy to find out in five minutes. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6716.339999999999s)]
*  So that's not even hard to find out. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6723.62s)]
*  But you haven't appeared on any... [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6725.86s)]
*  Not once because that's not quite true. If it has nothing to do with foreign policy issues, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6728.02s)]
*  it's just an economics question once in a while. But basically, the mainstream [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6735.54s)]
*  follows the security state line. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6744.26s)]
*  And they're acting against their own interest. This is not foddery, but it's just true whenever [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6748.34s)]
*  we do an interview with you, it gets millions of views and people love it and we make revenue off [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6751.38s)]
*  it. And it's like it's good business to have you on. I happen to agree with you [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6755.86s)]
*  and think you're wise, but it's not like people don't want to hear what you're saying. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6759.46s)]
*  Lots of people do. We've proven that. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6762.0199999999995s)]
*  People want to hear some explanations about... [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6763.86s)]
*  No, but you specifically. So you were a fixture on different channels, NBC, for example. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6766.74s)]
*  And so when they ban you from those channels, they're hurting themselves [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6772.42s)]
*  because viewers want to watch you. Well, it's just, I know that because I have you on. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6776.74s)]
*  So how exactly does that order go out? Do you think? Do you know the mechanics of keeping you [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6779.62s)]
*  off? Like one day there's just a bulletin, you know, no more Jeffrey Sachs or how does that work? [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6785.46s)]
*  I need to ask you because the phrasing, the official lines, kind of the stupidities and [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6791.78s)]
*  sillinesses on almost any story of the kind that we're talking about get repeated across the [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6802.1s)]
*  mainstream space very, very quickly. And not only on the US side, but generally in the British [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6809.54s)]
*  media as well. And so there's certainly some, there's an official narrative, of course. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6818.5s)]
*  So this is part of the story that senior White House briefing Jake or somebody else briefs. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6827.14s)]
*  And that becomes the meme. That becomes what you have to defend. You have to defend your [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6834.34s)]
*  continued access. You have to be good, loyal citizen of this. By the way, there are lots [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6839.14s)]
*  of contracts that go out with the military industrial complex. This is a trillion and a [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6847.06s)]
*  half dollar a year business, not a small business, by the way. It's real business. It's lots of [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6852.660000000001s)]
*  think tanks. It's lots of academic centers. It's lots of people on hire. It's lots of contracts. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6859.22s)]
*  It's lots of that all. You don't get any. I mean, I don't want any of that, but you don't get any [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6866.5s)]
*  of that if you're standing outside that none of it. So people make decisions. I think one of the [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0l_Zpt1xA&t=6872.9s)]
