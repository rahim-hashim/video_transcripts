# Military Expert Dan Caldwell Breaks Down What Will Happen Next in Israel’s War With Iran
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4)
*  So it seems likely the US government will participate in offensive strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=0.0s)]
*  If that happens what next how does Iran respond? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=6.24s)]
*  can airstrikes alone end the nuclear program and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=10.52s)]
*  What happens to the rest of the countries in the region and Iran's allies do they get involved? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=15.72s)]
*  There is no better person to talk this through with and former Pentagon official Dan Caldwell who joins us now [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=20.76s)]
*  As we sit here right now [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=30.0s)]
*  And I hope you'll correct me if you think this is this impression is wrong [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=33.04s)]
*  But I think the general view among people who are watching what's happening in Iran [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=36.62s)]
*  Is that the US is not going to be able to do anything against the US [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=42.04s)]
*  They're not going to be able to do anything against the US [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=45.2s)]
*  The US is not going to be able to do anything against the US [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=48.14s)]
*  And that's a very very important point [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=50.24s)]
*  And I think what I'm trying to say is that I think the US is not going to be able to do anything against the US [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=52.24s)]
*  What's happening in Iran [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  Is that there will be some kind of US strike? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=59.08s)]
*  I'm not this is I'm getting this one reading in the in the popular press [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=62.72s)]
*  There will be some kind of strike on Iran by the US military [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=66.4s)]
*  Against an enrichment site this the famous subterranean enrichment site [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=70.44s)]
*  With some kind of conventional large conventional bunker buster weapon [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=75.32s)]
*  That has not happened. Of course, we don't know that's gonna happen. We don't know anything [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=81.64s)]
*  But let's just assume that does happen [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=85.08s)]
*  What happens next [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=90.64s)]
*  Well, let me just say if it does happen. I hope all my predictions are dead wrong me, too [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for saying that that means dead Americans and you know, I won't say who I was talking to somebody who I guess you could [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=99.52s)]
*  describe as a neoconservative and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  You know, I said I hope if this happens you're making fun of me and calling me an idiot [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Me too. I totally I really mean that because there's guys [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  Who are just like me? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  15 20 years ago that are gonna be in the middle of this fight either they're gonna be on some of these bases [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=119.72s)]
*  They'll likely come on an attack. They're gonna be part of air crews. You can be on some of these ships [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=124.4s)]
*  I really hope that all the confident predictions play out and I'd love to be wrong [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  I can ask you to stop how are those guys since you've been one of those guys? How are those guys feeling right now? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=132.4s)]
*  You know [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=137.76s)]
*  Are they getting news? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  Are they on social media are they aware of what people in the US are saying about the likelihood of this? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=140.12s)]
*  I think that a lot of them are I have spoken to a few that are still in the service and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  The ones that I talked to are either senior listed or more senior officers [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  So they've been around for 15 20 some some cases 25 years at the tail end of their careers [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=156.72000000000003s)]
*  And honestly a lot of those guys are tired and these were guys [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=162.08s)]
*  20 years ago that the one thing they wanted was to get in the fight. They wanted to go to Iraq [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=167.1s)]
*  They wanted to go Afghanistan some of them are on their [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=172.82s)]
*  Seventh eighth deployments either to the region or to Europe or somewhere else [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=176.66s)]
*  and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=182.9s)]
*  They're they're worn out and they also see that the military has really [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=184.26s)]
*  Continued to be overstretched despite the fact that they Iraq and Afghanistan wars have wound down and remember we still have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  Thousands of troops in Iraq and Syria [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=195.94s)]
*  Thankfully the Trump administration prior to this appears to have started a retrograde a withdrawal from Syria. Hopefully we go to zero there [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=198.34s)]
*  So we solve a lot of troops there [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=206.54s)]
*  and a lot of them just feel like [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=208.7s)]
*  We've been doing this for so long and there's so many things we have to do to fix the military [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  You know to fix the culture something the DOD is really trying to prioritize. We need to reform our army [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=217.22s)]
*  You know secretary Dan Driscoll is starting this major army reform effort [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=223.02s)]
*  I think is important and another war will distract away from that will take resources away from that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=227.46s)]
*  There's that there's a huge problem right now with a standard of living within the United States military a lot of barracks are falling apart [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=233.38s)]
*  You had the Navy secretary John Phelan and credit to him [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=242.62s)]
*  He went out to Guam and saw the decrepit state of the barracks for I believe the Marines out there [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=246.14s)]
*  And he ordered them shut down and they were so bad. So [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=252.06s)]
*  Another war that that not only puts more lives in danger and requires more deployments to that region after 20 years of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=256.1s)]
*  continuous deployment sometimes the last minute [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  Again, it takes resources away from from things we need to do and I think a lot of folks are really worried about that as well [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=267.26s)]
*  if you're you're on a ship in the region right now and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=274.22s)]
*  You think there could be? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=278.66s)]
*  You know offensive military action by the US military and you're you're at some level of the chain. You're part of it [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  Are you nervous? I mean [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=286.62s)]
*  Being I I in when I was in the Marine Corps, you know, we are an amphibious branch [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=289.54s)]
*  I I never served on a on a ship before I flew over to Iraq. I didn't go over on a boat float, but I mean [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=293.98s)]
*  From what it's been described me you're in a a metal container [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=301.74s)]
*  I [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=305.22s)]
*  You know [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=306.42s)]
*  I used to talk a lot of trash about the Navy but but understanding what it's like to live on a ship six months at [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=307.06s)]
*  A time and especially when you get extended over and over again. I'd rather do multiple deployments to Iraq. I just like to say that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=312.46s)]
*  But it's very isolating. It's very [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  scary because [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=323.06s)]
*  You sometimes feel like you don't have control and that events are out of your hands in a way [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=324.5s)]
*  That's maybe not the same for somebody who's serving in the infantry or you're an individual pilot [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=329.42s)]
*  So we were to run literally. Yes. Yeah, it's it's terrifying and as [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  Been publicly reported we had some very very close calls in the recent fight against the Houthis is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=340.02s)]
*  there was [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=346.54s)]
*  You know some anti-ship missiles. We have a very [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=348.06s)]
*  effective [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=351.62s)]
*  ballistic missile defense and and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=352.94s)]
*  anti missile defense on these ships, but [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=355.38s)]
*  one of the reasons why [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=358.5s)]
*  One of those f-18s fell off the harriest as Truman was because it had to do some [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=360.38s)]
*  Aggressive maneuvers to potentially avoid a Houthi anti-ship missile and thankfully didn't hit but [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=366.02s)]
*  imagine being one of the six thousand sailors or and Marines on that ship and in that moment and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=371.46s)]
*  It's terrifying. It can be absolutely terrifying. It is terrifying. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I interrupt you guys [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  No, I was thinking that this morning [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=383.34s)]
*  What would it be like to be one of those guys just waiting for something to happen and knowing it could be nothing nothing but [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=385.14s)]
*  Respect for the United States Navy totally agree [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=389.94s)]
*  So you were saying and I just wanted to add my voice and vehement agreement [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=393.34s)]
*  I really hope to be wrong and every one of my predictions [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=397.42s)]
*  I hope to laugh at myself and apologize to everyone for being hysterical [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=400.16s)]
*  I really hope that I can do that and I know you feel so me [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=403.94s)]
*  So with that caveat, what do you think is likely to happen if a strike of the nature that I described happens? Well, I think [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=407.62s)]
*  the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=414.5s)]
*  Event to look back on the back to that could show us what could happen is what happened after the Soleimani strike [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=416.26s)]
*  And it's not a perfect comparison because it's pretty clear [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=423.42s)]
*  The Iranians telegraph to us that they were gonna do that. We had some back channel communications most likely and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=427.74s)]
*  So we knew it was coming and so our troops on Al Asad airbase where I served and actually interestingly where the vice president served [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=434.53999999999996s)]
*  as well too many years ago [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=441.52s)]
*  Were able to get to shelters and to get out of places that were very exposed and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  Iran launched a salvo of ballistic missiles at Al Asad airbase [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=449.64s)]
*  But even then which is where Al Asad airbase is in Western Iraq is an out in Al Anbar province. It's an outright [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  and one thing to note about [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=461.47999999999996s)]
*  That bases is that we do a lot of joint training with Iraqi army [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  And the Iraqi army is part of the same government that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  Has another security force called the Popular Mobilization Force, which is a group of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=473.64s)]
*  Militias that are loyal to Iran. They were funded [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  Initially supported and trained by coups force led by Soleimani at the time and so we are at that base [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=483.52s)]
*  Training allies of the people that are likely going to be trying to kill us in this war [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  so that's important to remember and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=495.64s)]
*  I think can lead you to understand that is still the case [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=499.0s)]
*  Absolutely, that's our main mission in Iraq right now is to support the Iraqi security forces [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=503.2s)]
*  which includes the Popular Mobilization Forces which consists of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=509.52s)]
*  Iran allied militia groups. This is so bonkers. It is the most convoluted mission [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=514.96s)]
*  I think on the face of the earth. Is that a mission that seems like a [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=520.48s)]
*  Suicide pack kind of kind of it seems like putting guys in jeopardy for what's the purpose exactly? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=525.32s)]

*  We need these troops in in al-assad and we need them in you know [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=538.52s)]
*  Parts of Baghdad still and other parts of the country to check Iran [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=543.0s)]

*  But as far as you know, they're there today those American troops are still in Iraq as far as I know [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=572.6s)]
*  Yes, still surrounded by Iranian proxies. Yes [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=577.84s)]
*  Yes, and so I would still have concerns about a strike [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=581.18s)]
*  Direct military intervention in Iran were those troops not there [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=587.06s)]

*  You know prior to being a DOD [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=692.06s)]

*  The [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=701.66s)]

*  The there are many crimes in the first Trump administration [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=716.26s)]
*  but one of the greatest crimes in the first Trump administration was an active effort by [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=719.22s)]
*  President Trump's own political appointees in some cases and elements of the military to undermine [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=726.38s)]
*  His stated preference to withdraw particularly from Syria and let's not forget you had the president's [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=732.4200000000001s)]
*  special representative I believe for Syria this guy Jim Jeffrey [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=740.5s)]
*  Who after he left the administration ran around Washington DC [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=744.54s)]
*  bragging about lying to the president about the number of troops in Syria [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=748.9s)]
*  so that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=754.38s)]
*  He would be less likely to withdraw them and that's not a crime. I think that's a crime [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=755.66s)]
*  It should be it absolutely should be and it's it's disgraceful and the fact of verting the civilian leadership of the military is not a crime [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=760.42s)]
*  I think it is [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=766.78s)]
*  Absolutely is and and I [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=768.22s)]
*  It was completely outrageous and as a result, you know, I I think there's a direct line between that and [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=770.62s)]
*  last year when [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=777.86s)]
*  You had three [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=780.1800000000001s)]
*  Army reservists killed at a tower 22 in Jordan by a drone [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=782.02s)]
*  tower 22 in Jordan is directly in support of it exists to support a base in Syria and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=787.62s)]
*  Had Jim Jeffrey and others not undermine President Trump those three reservists would likely still be alive today [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=793.9s)]
*  Why is it called tower 22? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=800.6999999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I I'm not entirely sure it is the US military installation of some kind in Jordan [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=802.66s)]
*  Yes, whose purpose is to support the US military installation that is in Syria, but shouldn't be it's literally right across the border and that and that that that [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=807.4599999999999s)]
*  That installation Syria is called TANF [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=815.6999999999999s)]
*  and again, none of this this has all been reported public info is [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=818.9s)]
*  The that was originally established to train [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=822.6999999999999s)]
*  anti-assad fighters to basically effectively retrained in the fight Isis and so [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=828.3399999999999s)]
*  Then that mission morphed into a counter Iran mission [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=834.9s)]
*  Where it's they wanted to keep American troops there and the proxies there [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=838.9399999999999s)]
*  So Iran wouldn't have a line of communication or basically, you know [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=844.7399999999999s)]
*  Ability to move forces from Iran through Iraq to Syria [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=849.8199999999999s)]
*  So that was justification but then things change in northern Syria the Syrian army started collaborating more with the Kurds [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=853.46s)]
*  so they got a line of communication and so then it ran out another mission and then it became airspace control and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=859.9s)]
*  by the time [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=866.18s)]
*  It was you got to January 2020. I believe it's January February 2024 when this incident happened [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=867.78s)]
*  The Biden administration it was reported, you know when people asked about the Syria policy Biden admin officials would just laugh because we had none [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=875.24s)]
*  So they were sitting there for no reason other than [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=883.9200000000001s)]
*  This belief is that you can never withdraw or retrench from anywhere because of surrender [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=887.6s)]
*  Well, the irony is of course that elements of Isis now run Syria and we're cool with that for some reason [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=892.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean at the end of the day [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=898.08s)]
*  I mean at the end of the day [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=900.08s)]
*  Jelani was created an American prison now. I will say I [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=902.08s)]
*  Think it is good. We're trying to remove sanctions on Syria. I totally agree because [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=907.5200000000001s)]
*  You know sanctions only hurt the the average person in Syria, I'm glad we're pursuing that [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad we're trying to pursue some type of diplomatic course there [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=919.72s)]
*  But let's be honest who won that war Al Qaeda won the war well, that's the point. Look I'm rooting for Jelani [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=922.6800000000001s)]
*  I want him to become you know a wise leader who makes the region more stable and peaceful and I want everyone to succeed [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=928.24s)]
*  But as long as we're framing everything in moral terms [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=936.5200000000001s)]
*  This just shows the true bankruptcy of the program. Yeah that we replaced [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=940.4000000000001s)]
*  Assad with Al Qaeda [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=946.36s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I guess the one thing to have in common is you both begin with a first but [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=949.24s)]
*  The one thing they don't have in common is only one of them is responsible for 9-eleven [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=954.96s)]
*  So I think I'm pretty pro Assad if that's the choice. I mean I yeah Assad definitely was incredibly nasty and awful [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=958.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but you essentially bring up 9-eleven. Who did we cooperate with after 9-eleven? We sent prisoners to [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=966.24s)]
*  Assad to help [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=973.2s)]
*  interrogate and ultimately [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=975.2800000000001s)]
*  We had a shared interest [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=977.6400000000001s)]
*  In stopping Al Qaeda so we cooperated with Assad early on terror [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=980.4399999999999s)]
*  I know so if you if you were to frame your foreign policy around your own interests or even around your own grievances [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  Like it's fair to be mad about 9-eleven. Yeah, all those people died 3,000 [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=990.0s)]
*  Then you would be you would definitely not be happy that the guy who helped you after 9-eleven was overthrown in favor of the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=994.28s)]
*  People who did 9-eleven like from an American perspective. That's not a win and we spent tens of billions of dollars [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1001.08s)]
*  In [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1007.28s)]
*  Syria we lost lives, you know, we we know Joe Kent, you know his story is called his wife [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1009.08s)]
*  absolute heroic woman [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1015.92s)]
*  You know other soldiers Marines were wounded [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1018.96s)]
*  We came close at several points [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1022.48s)]
*  To getting a combat with the actual Russian military. We had a major battle with Russian mercenaries a Wagner Wagner group [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1025.2s)]
*  There you know a lot of people focus on the risk of escalation in Ukraine and and an incident where [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1033.66s)]
*  American and Russian forces that are operating area could come in a conflict and where that could go that that almost happened in Syria on [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1041.58s)]
*  A weekly basis for several years because you had Russian and Syrian or you had Russian and American aircraft operating the same place [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1048.8999999999999s)]
*  You had American troops and Russian troops operating the same area [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1055.5s)]
*  One misunderstanding could have kicked off a cycle where weren't a major conflict with Russia and [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1059.58s)]
*  And and you know, the focus has been on Ukraine [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1065.78s)]
*  But the place for a longest time where Russian and American forces were brushing up against each other was in Syria. So [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1069.9399999999998s)]
*  Especially after the destruction of ISIS caliphate that mission should have ended and it is [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1077.5s)]
*  Again an absolute crime that it was undermined not once but twice in President Trump's first term [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1082.98s)]
*  You described our troop presence in Iraq as quote a tripwire [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1089.1399999999999s)]
*  Can you flesh out what you mean by that and how it happened? I [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1094.82s)]
*  Would say both Iraq and Syria and probably more serious [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1099.02s)]
*  that kind of gets to [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1103.26s)]
*  ultimately [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1105.6599999999999s)]
*  Why I think some people wanted to keep our troops there is that if there was a mass casualty incident [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1107.1799999999998s)]
*  where an Iranian aligned militia or [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1114.06s)]
*  Some other actor [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1117.8200000000002s)]
*  Attacked American troops and you know, god forbid killed [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1120.66s)]
*  Or wounded a significant number of troops that would have been justification to escalate either against Iran or to [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1125.3400000000001s)]
*  Get more involved fighting other groups like, you know al Qaeda ISIS and so just their mere presence [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1132.3400000000001s)]
*  Was again, they weren't effectively deterring Iran or other actors because they're just too small [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1140.46s)]
*  But their presence in them itself was a risk that we could be sucked into a major war [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1146.98s)]
*  So are you saying that you sincerely believe there are US policymakers who intentionally put American troops at risk? I [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1151.26s)]

*  consciously [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1161.5400000000002s)]
*  There are US at least I don't want to believe no there are US policymakers that believe that but [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1164.18s)]
*  You know, I I think subconsciously some folks did I think and Johnson allowed the USS Liberty to be attacked [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1171.26s)]
*  He knew those guys were gonna die. I thought they're all gonna die [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1176.94s)]
*  I mean that I think that's true. So I mean that's happened before he's the president United States allowing [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1178.7800000000002s)]
*  Hoping for the death of US troops for some other agenda [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1184.5s)]
*  Like there are people that evil Lyndon Johnson was that evil? Yeah [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1188.42s)]
*  I mean the the you know when we know now about Gulf of Tonkin and all that other I think so exactly [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1191.7s)]
*  yeah, exactly and I [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1196.8600000000001s)]
*  you know my [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1199.5400000000002s)]
*  My belief is is that honestly a lot of it more had to do and we talked about this last interview this kind of [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1201.6200000000001s)]
*  Policy inertia like right. It's easier just to say let's keep doing the status quo [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1206.54s)]
*  as opposed to actually [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1212.3s)]
*  changing something because [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1215.34s)]
*  There's less risk in a lot of people's minds now again [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1217.02s)]
*  I just laid out the risk of keeping troops there, but in some people's minds, there's less risk to their career [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1220.06s)]
*  By preserving the status quo as opposed to changing something that's not working [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1226.06s)]
*  So Roe v. Wade was overturned three years ago and people celebrated but the battle over abortion is [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1230.86s)]
*  Not over. In fact, did you know that? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1237.3s)]
*  Abortions are at a 10-year high in a lot of ways [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1240.74s)]
*  It's the saddest thing that happens in this country the birthrate falls and the killing of children [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1243.22s)]
*  accelerates [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1249.3799999999999s)]
*  It's awful pre-born is fighting this trend [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1250.58s)]
*  They're expanding their life-affirming care in the darkest corners of the country to help women and save babies [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1253.98s)]
*  Now abortion mafia don't want women to think about what they are carrying [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1258.98s)]
*  They want them to think that ending the pregnancy will solve all of their problems [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1263.58s)]
*  But that is not true 11% of women who take the abortion pill for example go on to suffer serious health [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1266.78s)]
*  Consequences and that does not include the emotional and moral consequences [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1272.98s)]
*  It's bad. It's ending a life [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1278.02s)]
*  So when you give to pre-born you are not just saving a baby [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1280.32s)]
*  You're saving a mother to pre-born has already rescued over 350,000 babies [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1283.5s)]
*  There are still many many more who need help [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1287.86s)]
*  Dell pound 250 and say the keyword baby to support their cause that's pound 250 baby [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1290.46s)]
*  Go to pre-born comm slash Tucker pre-born comm slash Tucker because children are the greatest gift [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1296.02s)]
*  Period and regardless of motive. I think your point is [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1303.22s)]
*  Demonstrably true whether or not the people who set it up intended it to be a tripwire [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1308.22s)]
*  It is a tripwire. Yes, that's fair, right? Yes, absolutely [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1312.58s)]
*  So that's the first thing that could happen if we strike if the US military strikes [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1316.42s)]
*  Offensively against Iran in any way, right? So yeah, and okay. So then what else what would happen then well [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1324.14s)]
*  That's where [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1332.18s)]
*  there's really it all depends on [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1334.18s)]
*  the impact of the counter-strike on [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1337.22s)]
*  US troops and on American facilities and how the United States responds if [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1339.94s)]
*  We continue at that point you're on the escalation ladder [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1345.5s)]
*  so if our troops are attacked and we attack [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1348.78s)]
*  we counter-attack with a larger strike and a larger force and if we use certain bases in the region like [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1354.34s)]
*  Saying in places like Qatar Kuwait Bahrain the Emirates Saudi Arabia [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1361.46s)]
*  If if these countries allow us and there's a good chance this is something I think [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1366.26s)]
*  Needs to be constantly reinforces that these Gulf Arab states are not where they were in 2019 [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1371.6200000000001s)]
*  so [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1378.1000000000001s)]
*  There's not it's not a guarantee that they would allow us to use these bases in their country to attack Iran [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1379.22s)]
*  But if the Iranians perceive whether it's true or not that we are using those bases and they're looking to punish us [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1384.56s)]
*  they will attack a bases that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1391.8600000000001s)]
*  Are you know larger more maybe more hardened but hosts a lot more troops [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1395.1799999999998s)]
*  And that could quickly lead to more casualties. It also taught attack ships [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1401.62s)]
*  in the Arabian Sea or Persian Gulf [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1407.3799999999999s)]
*  And they could also if we continue to get pushed up the escalation ladder attack US diplomatic facilities [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1411.1s)]
*  Now those are all worst-case scenarios, but they're risks that should be considered and can't be ignored [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1417.7399999999998s)]
*  So it gets back to this this whole idea that I just and again, I hope I'm wrong [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1424.34s)]
*  I finally don't buy that you can just do one or two strikes and that's it and Iranians [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1428.9399999999998s)]
*  You know aren't gonna respond [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1434.8999999999999s)]
*  It's gonna have to be you're gonna have to prepare and expect a much longer and much more bloody military campaign [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1437.3s)]
*  Obviously without divulging the details of any kind of classified planning document [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1446.86s)]
*  We know that the Pentagon has been thinking about [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1451.82s)]
*  How was Iran would respond to a strike against its enrichment facilities for like a long time a long long time? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1454.3799999999999s)]
*  This has been I mean people and I know that you're one of them [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1460.22s)]
*  Does anybody? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1463.82s)]
*  think [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1465.66s)]
*  That they just wouldn't respond [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1466.78s)]
*  I'm sure there are people right now who are trying to say is they won't respond is like they're weak [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1470.66s)]
*  They're on their back foot [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1477.22s)]
*  They [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1479.6200000000001s)]
*  They're they want to just come save save the regime [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1480.58s)]
*  So therefore they're just gonna back off that they're not actually gonna respond and if you look at the hours [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1484.42s)]
*  immediately after [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1493.26s)]
*  the Israeli [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1494.8600000000001s)]
*  Initial Israeli set of airstrikes if there's some people saying [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1496.7s)]
*  watch like Iran's not gonna really respond or it's gonna be weak and [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1500.5s)]
*  You know over the next few days they launched between four and five hundred ballistic missiles again [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1505.02s)]
*  Thankfully, they weren't as effective as originally advertised [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1510.8s)]
*  But still Dave as we sit here today, I believe killed around 25 Israelis [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1514.1s)]
*  Wounded nearly 600 they've been able to hit [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1519.86s)]
*  You know, they wounded 600 Israeli so yes. Yeah [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1524.3s)]
*  Are we there's total military censorship in Israel Israeli citizens not only believe [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1528.66s)]
*  Most of them are not allowed to leave the country. They shut it down. So like they're stuck there [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1534.34s)]
*  for people and [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1538.58s)]
*  So and there's you know, total control of the press in Israel [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1541.1s)]
*  So do we know like are we confident we know the casualty numbers in Israel? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1544.54s)]
*  No both sides the the numbers that have been released by both sides are in some cases [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1549.86s)]
*  Maybe overstating things. I think it's it's likely the Iranians are maybe overstating civilian casualties understating [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1556.7s)]
*  Military casualties you would guess and I think I think it's a lagging indicator my understanding and again [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1564.26s)]
*  I'm not an expert on this is that the way the Israelis work is that they allow the information to come out at just a later [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1569.74s)]
*  point [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1576.08s)]
*  But look, I mean in some ways don't blame them because somebody [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1577.06s)]
*  Filming something from a balcony [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1582.34s)]
*  And how a missile hits that is intelligence for their oh, I oh I'm not complaining about I'm just saying I [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1584.78s)]
*  Always and you saw something you see that very in Ukraine as well [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1591.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you that's a whole different. I mean the casualty numbers in Ukraine [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1595.76s)]
*  You know American lawmakers who funded this war extended this war for years at the expense of the Ukrainians [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1600.2s)]
*  I think have a moral obligation to know how many Ukrainians have died. They did this. Yeah, but they don't care [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1605.6200000000001s)]
*  I actually think there's an amendment and I could be wrong about this put in one of the National Defense Authorization Acts or an attempt [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1611.6000000000001s)]
*  To force the disclosure of the two true casualty numbers [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1618.96s)]
*  And I think it was defeated or it was added in and just it's being ignored by DoD [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1623.16s)]
*  Yeah, I really think that's some contemptible. I've asked a bunch of lawmakers who who have are really responsible for the war [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1627.48s)]
*  Or the continuation of the war, you know, like how many Ukrainians have died? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1635.44s)]
*  They have no interest in knowing, you know, but the point the point of walking all that through that is [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1640.12s)]
*  They're and Iran is [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1648.04s)]
*  Really adjusting and changing their tactics as the war grinds on and that's in part because Israelis have been successful and destroying [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1651.56s)]
*  Some of their mobile missile launchers and their missile stocks [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1659.76s)]
*  So the barrages aren't as intense but you're seeing them introduce more new systems and here's here's the most important thing that [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1662.68s)]
*  You know absent an American intervention, which as we've discussed could be imminent [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1671.16s)]
*  Right now the war is essentially a race between Iran and Israel [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1676.02s)]
*  For [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1681.74s)]
*  The Israelis they are trying to destroy as many Iranian ballistic missile launchers in ballistic missiles [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1682.9399999999998s)]
*  Before they run out of [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1691.2199999999998s)]
*  anti-missile [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1693.34s)]
*  ballistic missile [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1694.62s)]
*  interceptors for their arrow [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1696.1399999999999s)]
*  David sling systems and then our fad systems and our SM3 SM6 is that we're launching off the ships [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1698.78s)]
*  Likewise the Iranians are trying to preserve [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1704.42s)]
*  as many of their missile systems and [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1708.58s)]
*  Survive as many [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1711.86s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes as possible [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1713.86s)]
*  While the Israelis wear down their store of precision munitions and and missile interceptors [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1717.62s)]
*  So each side is trying to get to a point where they're either not threatened by certain offensive weapons systems [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1723.9s)]
*  Or their offensive weapons systems can breach [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1730.86s)]
*  defensive systems more effectively and inflict more casualties and [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1734.54s)]
*  Either smart people that say right now in that race [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1739.1799999999998s)]
*  Israel has a slight advantage other smart people say Iran has a slight advantage because the number of missiles they stockpiled [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1742.82s)]
*  And that really right now is is the game. So there's a time pressure here on both sides and [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1750.1s)]
*  Absent [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1757.1399999999999s)]
*  Absent [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1759.3s)]
*  You know American military intervention, which will change the whole dynamic is that's really what it's gonna come down to [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1760.3s)]
*  What side can outlast the other with certain types of weapons and weapons systems again with the caveat? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1766.02s)]
*  I have no freaking idea what's gonna happen. Nobody does other than well, I don't know that anybody does right now [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1771.66s)]
*  I [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1778.14s)]
*  Mean there's been reported repeatedly that there's gonna be American military intervention. Like that's just like reported as fact [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1779.78s)]
*  And whether it is or not [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1787.5s)]
*  So I just want to focus a little more intently on how does that change the dynamic and how much? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1789.1399999999999s)]
*  offensive [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1796.1399999999999s)]
*  Intervention would qualify as like dragging America into the war officially any [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1797.4199999999998s)]
*  well [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1802.62s)]
*  again, a lot of it goes that goes back to the conversation we're just having if [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1803.8999999999999s)]
*  If Iran doesn't respond to just one or two strikes [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1809.46s)]
*  They decide to take that blow and there's evidence that they [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1814.22s)]
*  Most the evidence shows they probably wouldn't then that would probably contain the size of the American offensive operation [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1818.7s)]
*  but if we were to go in I think it is likely that we wouldn't just hit a [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1825.94s)]
*  Nuclear site for the sake of our own troops [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1832.0600000000002s)]
*  So it would not just be a one-off strike or we'd coordinate with Israelis [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1834.8200000000002s)]
*  And again if there is an attack on [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1840.7800000000002s)]
*  American bases in response to this that would pull the United States more into the war and push us into [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1843.46s)]
*  spiral where we're constantly [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1850.94s)]
*  Escalating against the other side and then that brings us to a point where even though it's pretty clear the Trump administration [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1853.46s)]
*  even if they do decide to do the strike doesn't want a regime change war is [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1860.9s)]
*  Ultimately get pulled into a regime change war whether or not we want it [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1865.5s)]
*  So none of this is even on the table [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1869.9s)]
*  You know ten days ago until the Prime Minister of Israel called the president of the United States and said I'm going and I'm doing it [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1871.5400000000002s)]
*  I don't care what you say [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1877.5s)]
*  It's all been reported in the New York Times give him three days notice [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1879.42s)]
*  It's just a little bit crazy that all of a sudden we're talking about like how are we gonna deal with this war against Iran? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1883.02s)]
*  Which wasn't even a thing [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1887.6200000000001s)]
*  Two weeks ago, so I just want to say that how if this were a war that the United States chose [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1889.6200000000001s)]
*  This was it wasn't this war that was chosen for us [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1895.98s)]
*  We were going along with it [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1898.68s)]
*  But if we had chosen this if we decided like pending on HQ, we're gonna take out those enrichment facilities [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1900.4s)]
*  How like you wouldn't do it three days later, right? There's a lot of planning for these things [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1907.68s)]
*  Yes, and this is I mean again stuff has been publicly reported is these types of operations been planned for years [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1913.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and they've had different plans. They've [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1920.6000000000001s)]
*  Just they've adjusted but have essentially been on the shelf for four years now [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1923.44s)]
*  Yeah [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1928.76s)]
*  But does it make it harder to get just three days notice before this the shooting starts? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1929.48s)]
*  um [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1935.3600000000001s)]
*  This is where I'm a little unsure because I don't know [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1936.8000000000002s)]
*  What a hundred percent for sure? There's a lot of public reporting, but that's not always so that's your you're absolutely right [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1940.16s)]
*  And I shouldn't pretend like I know and and so I don't know what was in the region or not, but [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1946.16s)]
*  there [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1951.88s)]
*  to [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1953.0400000000002s)]
*  successfully accomplish something like this [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1954.1200000000001s)]
*  You do need a third needs to be a lot of things that happen leading up into that [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1956.52s)]
*  I think that is fair to say and the United States military can move quickly [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1961.12s)]
*  When it needs to I'll say it can move quickly when you don't have large number of ground troops [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1965.7199999999998s)]
*  when you're primarily relying on air and naval assets, so you can move stuffing quickly, but [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1971.7199999999998s)]
*  Leading up into that there would have there normally would be a lot of planning [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1978.2399999999998s)]
*  But again, I'm sorry if I'm going back and forth here [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1982.3s)]
*  This has been a scenario that has been planned for for a long time [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1984.6200000000001s)]
*  If there's one thing we've learned over the past couple of years, it's that when things go south unexpectedly and they do [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1987.98s)]
*  You are in charge of your family's health and safety not the authorities [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1994.3s)]
*  You and so prepare think it through ahead of time [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=1999.02s)]
*  You remember that during the dark days of kovat for example [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2002.5s)]
*  You kept hearing about a medication a medicine called ivermectin doctors have used ivermectin for decades [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2005.8600000000001s)]
*  Treating parasites viruses even studying as a potential cancer treatment, but you are not allowed to use it [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2011.26s)]
*  In fact, you're a bad person if you even use the word [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2016.26s)]
*  but at JACE [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2019.3799999999999s)]
*  They've thought this through and they've looked at the evidence that doctors adjacent created a powerful [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2021.18s)]
*  Anti-parasite formula made with a blend that includes ivermectin [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2026.5s)]
*  It's the fastest most affordable option on the market and getting it actually is simple getting that and other life-saving [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2030.82s)]

*  JACE.com discount code Tucker in thinking about this [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2064.98s)]
*  non-classified of course, but [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2070.02s)]
*  given that Iran is part of bricks and has [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2072.34s)]
*  All kinds of military and economic ties with Russia and China. How high is the concern that they might get involved? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2075.7000000000003s)]
*  so [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2082.02s)]
*  This is this is where it gets interesting is [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2083.42s)]
*  I [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2086.6200000000003s)]
*  Think [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2088.94s)]
*  Russia in particular has a lot of reasons for them not to get involved [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2090.54s)]
*  That's my sense and the reason there's a few reasons is one a lot of the things that Iran would need from Russia [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2095.62s)]
*  Are actually things that Russians really need in Ukraine, right? So air defense assets [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2103.1s)]
*  fighter jets and things like that is is Russia's [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2108.9s)]
*  Military and industrial base is much more developed than the United States and NATO interesting fact [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2112.38s)]
*  And you know the NATO secretary general says all the time is [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2119.06s)]
*  Russia produces more weapons and munitions in three months than all of NATO combined produces in a year [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2123.42s)]
*  So but the Russian way of war in Ukraine relies on overwhelming firepower [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2130.14s)]
*  So it's very difficult for them to divert weapons to other partners. I'm not saying that that that couldn't happen [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2136.18s)]
*  Maybe there's some intelligence sharing but I I don't think that [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2143.86s)]
*  My gut would be is they would not support Iran in a very big way. I think China is is is different [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2147.82s)]
*  I don't think that they would overtly support the Iranians [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2153.82s)]
*  But I think if there's one party that over the medium term at least and they may face some short-term [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2157.78s)]
*  challenges because of disruption and energy surprise but over the medium term that would benefit from [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2165.26s)]
*  Another major war in the Middle East and what the United States is heavily involved in it is China [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2170.78s)]
*  because the weapons that we would be using to fight Iran are [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2176.86s)]
*  What we would need in a Pacific contingency and God forbid we fight a war with China [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2182.9s)]
*  It's not even fighting war either [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2188.86s)]
*  It's weapons that we want to supply to some of our partners [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2189.98s)]
*  Whether it's Japan or the Philippines or South Korea or Taiwan [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2193.62s)]
*  Those are all systems that would be heavily used whether it's air defense [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2197.9s)]
*  standoff munitions [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2204.42s)]
*  You know [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2206.5400000000004s)]
*  Sir other types of of air surface munitions surface to surface munitions [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2207.5800000000004s)]
*  those those are the things that are going to lead the Iran fight because of [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2213.1400000000003s)]
*  Just the size of Iran Iran is a huge country both in terms of population but geography [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2216.94s)]
*  it's not a small in terms of geography as Iraq and [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2222.94s)]
*  It's as much longer distances to say get from the Persian Gulf up to Tehran [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2227.26s)]
*  So you have to rely on certain types of weapons and certain types of aircraft again all of which are [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2231.42s)]
*  Would be at the tip of the spear in a fight against China. So it is in their interest [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2237.6600000000003s)]
*  To see us expand more and more munitions and wear down more and more weapon systems in the Persian Gulf. So [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2242.1400000000003s)]
*  Again China's played it very smart and how they engage the Middle East. I [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2249.5s)]
*  Think that they would be more willing to do things economically to help Iran and maybe provide some non-lethal [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2254.06s)]
*  Systems like they have for Russia that could be beneficial for Iran in this fight [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2261.1400000000003s)]
*  But again, you can't what's and what do you mean by non-lethal systems? So for example [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2266.98s)]
*  China there's debate over this but there's not really [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2273.02s)]
*  Clear evidence that China has provided lethal weapons systems [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2277.42s)]
*  Like Iran and North Korea had to Russia [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2282.0600000000004s)]
*  However, they have provided non-lethal weapons systems like counter drone technology to Russia [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2284.1400000000003s)]
*  They have provided they've helped them get around some of the Western sanctions. They've helped provide them certain types of electronics [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2291.1000000000004s)]
*  They're maybe harder to get from the West. I think we can say that with confidence [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2298.7000000000003s)]
*  They could do that with Iran and massive investment in Russia. Yes, by the way keeps the Russian population [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2302.3s)]
*  Prosperous and happy and not complaining about the war. Yes [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2309.1000000000004s)]
*  but again as we you know talked about before that's not a natural alliance and [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2312.86s)]
*  The the Russian security services are still very suspicious of the Chinese just like the Iranian security services aren't [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2319.46s)]
*  They're still suspicious of the Russians because there's a long history of Russia [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2327.42s)]
*  invading and [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2333.1000000000004s)]
*  These are countries that border each other yes occupying Iran I believe twice in the 20th century so [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2334.8999999999996s)]
*  Getting back to the theme that we've talked about before is like [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2342.46s)]
*  We've all pushed these countries together because of our dumb forward policy. We should be able to pull them apart [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2345.14s)]
*  They should have natural tension, but because of our foreign policy over the last 30 years [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2350.14s)]
*  We're creating these opportunities for cooperation and that makes the situation the Middle East worst [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2354.3399999999997s)]
*  The situation Ukraine worse in the situation Pacific worse for us [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2359.2599999999998s)]
*  Do you think there's any chance that China become if you know if this does become a direct conflict between the United States and Iran [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2365.66s)]
*  that China [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2372.06s)]
*  Enters it in a way. That's like that. We can't ignore. That's just so provocative that we're [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2373.58s)]
*  War with them, too [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2378.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it's more likely that they would make a decision to do something in the Pacific because that [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2379.7799999999997s)]
*  Is more important to them. I I don't I [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2385.8199999999997s)]
*  Don't buy this argument that [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2389.02s)]
*  If we were to pull out of the Middle East that China would want to become a hegemon in the Middle East [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2391.74s)]
*  They have been able to use smart power in minimal military power to maintain influence and reap economic benefits from Middle East and [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2399.58s)]
*  They don't have the the force projection capabilities that the United States has [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2408.54s)]
*  Some smart people that I've worked with [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2413.86s)]
*  Have made pretty compelling arguments that that that they are not likely [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2416.58s)]
*  To try and dominate the Middle East so I don't think China would get directly involved in the Middle East [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2421.9s)]
*  But if they see the United States [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2428.46s)]
*  Worn down even more in the Middle East that may change some of their calculus vis-a-vis Taiwan [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2431.06s)]
*  And I wonder not just Taiwan. So we've been in [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2436.2999999999997s)]
*  Japan for 80 years. We've been in Korea since [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2440.1s)]
*  1950 75 years [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2442.7799999999997s)]
*  Those are like in their neighborhood [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2446.1s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm certainly not justifying anything trying to die [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2448.82s)]
*  I'm not you know, but I'm just trying to understand like their perspective because I think it's meaningful if [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2452.66s)]
*  There were you know, if there was an 80 year old Chinese military base in Belize, you'd be like a little close [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2457.42s)]
*  We wouldn't want that nobody wants that and so maybe their expectation is that they can drive us out of the east [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2463.54s)]
*  out of their direct sphere [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2469.9s)]
*  Is that a concern I mean is that something that people think this stuff through think about um [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2472.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think there have been people that have thought about that and I think there's a lot of people [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2479.3s)]
*  honestly, I think one of the biggest issues the Pentagon is dealing with right now is [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2484.34s)]
*  Since that has been identified as the main theater the main [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2488.38s)]
*  Threat the pacing to use, you know military turn the pacing threat [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2493.1800000000003s)]
*  More pacing challenge whatever term you want to use [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2498.7000000000003s)]
*  That everything we're doing in the Middle East trades off against the Pacific which from an economic standpoint is [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2502.6600000000003s)]
*  Much more important to us than the Middle East [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2510.1800000000003s)]
*  You know what happens in the South China Sea is fundamentally more important than what happens in the Middle East [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2513.38s)]
*  Middle East I think is you know five [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2520.58s)]
*  Five percent of the world's population five percent of the GDP East Asia is like something like sixty percent [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2524.1800000000003s)]
*  Forty or sixty percent of the world's GDP. So just from a trade and the conditions of our economic prosperity standpoint [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2530.86s)]
*  It is it is much more important to us and China is an actual [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2538.82s)]
*  real existential threat to the United States where Iran is is a threat in so as much that [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2543.38s)]
*  We have forty thousand troops spread across the Middle East many of them [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2549.7400000000002s)]
*  Who are in exposed positions as we've talked about that are vulnerable to Iranian attacks [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2554.54s)]
*  That's the biggest reason why they're a threat. I don't know. I don't think you watch Fox News [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2560.5s)]
*  I heard Ted Cruz say that the Iranians are gonna nuke LA [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2564.42s)]
*  Well as of right now, they don't have a nuclear bomb [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2569.9s)]
*  One interesting thing is is Iran has not [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2573.6600000000003s)]
*  developed [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2577.7400000000002s)]
*  Missiles that go beyond a certain range doesn't mean they can't [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2579.1000000000004s)]
*  But they have been hesitant to up until this point because they don't want to be seen as threatening [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2582.86s)]
*  Countries outside their region. So why is Ted Cruz saying they're gonna nuke LA? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2589.1800000000003s)]
*  I think and again, I've been a big Ted Cruz fan over the years. I've come to you know [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2592.86s)]
*  Respect him on many levels. I think [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2600.1000000000004s)]
*  He is repeating a talking point [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2602.5s)]
*  to help [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2605.94s)]
*  Raise the level in people's minds a level of threat that I ran actually imposed. Let's let's in order to justify [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2607.5400000000004s)]
*  American and [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2614.42s)]
*  Involvement in regime change, right? Let's be honest. Iran has been a bad actor in the Middle East [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2615.8599999999997s)]
*  They've been a they have been a major sponsor of terrorism [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2621.18s)]
*  Indisputably, but I believe their economy is the size of Pennsylvania [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2625.3399999999997s)]
*  Saudi Arabia alone spends four times what they do on defense [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2630.14s)]
*  They're bordered by Pakistan that has a nuclear weapon and they have pretty decent relationship right now [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2634.1s)]
*  But over the years there's been tension because Pakistan Sunni [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2641.08s)]
*  Iran Shia you have Israel with a very capable nuclear triad and very capable [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2644.3199999999997s)]
*  army, so they're surrounded by [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2650.64s)]
*  Countries in the region that have historical antagonisms with them [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2654.16s)]
*  And they simply right now do not possess the capability to hit the United States with conventional weapons [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2658.44s)]
*  What they do and this is something we've talked about need to be concerned about is they do have [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2665.24s)]
*  the ability to [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2671.12s)]
*  Infiltrate terrorists in other countries that is a risk that is something we need to take into account [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2672.96s)]
*  But is not existential like the threat posed by China [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2678.04s)]
*  With the what is quickly emerging as the biggest Navy in the world with hundreds of nuclear weapons including [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2682.04s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic missiles against the United States [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2688.52s)]
*  China that that you know could shut off a significant amount of trade and economic activity to the United States and [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2691.2s)]
*  And harm us in [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2698.84s)]
*  significant ways [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2701.0s)]
*  Iran is simply not an existential threat in the same way that that China is and even Russia is with 6,000 nuclear weapons [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2702.64s)]
*  So why are we so focused on Iran? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2708.88s)]
*  There are a lot of reasons [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2712.0s)]
*  They can't be strictly limited to our national interest given what you just said again it goes back to [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2714.6800000000003s)]
*  First and foremost and I know people want to talk about a whole host of other things [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2721.2000000000003s)]
*  But but really the the thing that is driving this the most and our focus on Iran in the Middle East as a whole is [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2725.88s)]
*  That too many of our policymakers still believe in the idea that [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2733.32s)]
*  America needs to be not simply the most powerful country in the world, but the most [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2738.76s)]
*  Dominant power in the world that we need to have dominance in a way that we are able to impose our values on [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2744.52s)]
*  Other parts of the world that have rejected the maybe mainly liberalism that that we need to use our dominance to achieve liberal hegemony and [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2752.52s)]
*  That leads us to into conflict with countries in regions that really don't [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2762.56s)]
*  Shouldn't matter as much to us as they should we do have some interest in Middle East to be clear and I can walk through [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2768.48s)]
*  those but [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2773.16s)]
*  The countries that just don't pose the type of threat that a lot of people in Washington have them up [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2774.88s)]
*  Wouldn't it be easier if you're the Iranian government just like observe Pride Month in Tehran and just like get this over with and [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2780.0s)]
*  Then then there's no threat of a new kind of attack, right? Well, you know as Brett Stevens told my friend [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2788.16s)]
*  Soar Aboumary, you know, he wants to ultimately see the 82nd Airborne in the streets of Tehran [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2794.88s)]
*  You know escorting a gay pride parade and that kind of that kind of sums that up Brett Stevens said that yeah [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2800.0s)]
*  Man I've known a lot of people in 56 years [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2807.0s)]
*  I don't know I've ever met anybody weirder and dumber than Brett Stevens, but that's just me [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2809.72s)]
*  I actually this is gonna sound weird. Yeah, I respect him because he just says it out loud [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2813.7599999999998s)]
*  he he he says yeah, I want the United States to be the most dominant power in the world to [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2819.8399999999997s)]
*  Spread liberal values. I want I want the United States to be from even from this country [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2826.72s)]
*  I mean, it's like getting a lecture about America from Brett Stevens is like I [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2831.5s)]
*  Again, I I just have pretty sure he's from Mexico, but whatever [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2836.2799999999997s)]
*  Is yeah, he's from I didn't know that but again I in a weird way obviously find his views abhorrent [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2840.12s)]
*  I mean, he's he said absolutely fundamentally racist things about about, you know Arabs and other people [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2846.46s)]
*  He's got a weird obsession with genetics, but he's honest [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2854.3599999999997s)]
*  He doesn't try to like wrap it in the in the this cloak of American interests and American values [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2858.04s)]
*  He just comes out and said is it and and again in a weird way. I kind of appreciate that [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2866.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean there there's I guess that that's where the being an idiot [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2870.96s)]
*  Kind of plays into it. He just kind of says it isn't it isn't funny essentially that I [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2876.6s)]
*  Think you have what three or four? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2881.7200000000003s)]
*  New York Times op-ed writers that believe exactly what he believes. I mean David Brooks [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2884.68s)]
*  David French [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2891.76s)]
*  Him Tom Friedman's kind of [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2893.72s)]
*  Evolving I don't even know where Tom Friedman is these days, but essentially they they they they yeah [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2897.04s)]
*  They they hold the same views [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2902.56s)]
*  the supposed, you know [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2905.16s)]
*  Left-wing paper and there's some look they've you know credit New York Times [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2907.3199999999997s)]
*  sometimes they do have some good stuff on their op-ed pages, but [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2910.8399999999997s)]
*  You know that you have you essentially have four op-ed columnists that believe essentially the same thing [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2914.8599999999997s)]
*  They just express it differently like David French would never be that David French would be the guy that that masks it and like [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2920.28s)]
*  This is what's good for America and America. They're all violence worshipers David French, especially and there is a kind of like weak man [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2926.2400000000002s)]
*  compensates through [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2934.2000000000003s)]
*  Promoting killing and other parts of the world, you know, it's like this sort of same [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2937.6000000000004s)]
*  Weird cuck syndrome they all have [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2942.5600000000004s)]
*  No, it is though. It is I mean you don't have to be Sigmund Freud to see like David French [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2944.92s)]
*  Like a psychosexual thing that's going on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so handsome. I mean I I'll say this David is you know [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2949.32s)]
*  I'm a much bigger dick than you are and I'm sorry you're such a nice. No, I will you bring up certain people [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2956.0800000000004s)]
*  I will be a dick is I think David [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2962.0800000000004s)]
*  It's he's so interesting because he brought away [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2964.8s)]
*  Such a much different [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2968.6800000000003s)]
*  I know there's people that you know mocks his military service [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2970.76s)]
*  But he brought it way like a much different [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2976.08s)]
*  Understanding of his service in Iraq than a lot of other people and I've just kind of found that fascinating and and I think [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2979.2799999999997s)]
*  in a lot of ways [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2986.3199999999997s)]
*  His views are [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2989.48s)]
*  really [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2992.44s)]
*  Increasingly the way he talks about foreign policy [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2993.72s)]
*  I think he's more of a barometer of where the center of the Democrat Party is than the the dying [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=2996.3199999999997s)]
*  Neoconservative fringe of the Republican Party is he is representing increasingly where the Democrat Party is not the Republican Party on foreign policy [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3003.24s)]
*  Interesting and we brought this up last time remember the the Democrat [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3011.04s)]
*  party platform in 2020 [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3017.08s)]
*  was [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3019.56s)]
*  More hawkish on Iran. They did a 180 from from 20 me in 2024 [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3021.2s)]
*  They did a 180 from where they were in 2020 on Iran in 2024 and it was more hawkish and there's a world where you could [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3026.8999999999996s)]
*  Add Liz Cheney as a national security advisor or has a secretary of defense. That's just the darkest thing I can imagine [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3034.22s)]
*  So you just want to go back to something you said a second ago. You said the dying [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3039.74s)]
*  Republican neocon fringe [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3044.14s)]
*  Of course, I love the sound of that but it's hard to see you're looking obviously in more broadly than I am because right now [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3046.3799999999997s)]
*  I see Fox News as just this [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3052.98s)]
*  Pure crazed neocon war propaganda operation [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3056.02s)]
*  Mark Levin the least credible person in broadcasting is like in charge of the government [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3059.7s)]
*  I mean I'm overstating of course, but it's like they seem very powerful right now that part of the Republican Party Mitch McConnell [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3065.1s)]
*  Tom Cotton [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3071.46s)]
*  Ted Cruz [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3073.02s)]
*  Mark Levin [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3074.5s)]
*  But you're saying they're a dying fringe [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3076.42s)]
*  Again, it's looking at it right now [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3079.58s)]
*  It's very [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3082.38s)]
*  Easy to think that the neocons have once again taken over the foreign policy apparatus of the Republican Party [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3084.2999999999997s)]
*  But I think we need to look at a couple things [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3091.8599999999997s)]
*  There is no popular support for [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3094.7799999999997s)]
*  Going to war directly with Iran we have to acknowledge there is concern about Iran getting nuclear weapon [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3099.1s)]
*  But there's not a constituency [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3106.3199999999997s)]
*  for going to war with Iran and it hasn't really ever been one but [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3109.2999999999997s)]
*  Most of your Republican voters don't want this [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3113.2200000000003s)]
*  I looked up the numbers the polling numbers and I think the AIDS virus is more popular than the idea of going to war with Iran [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3115.9s)]
*  I think it's actually 16% national support. Yeah, and that was from you gov. Brookings has done polls the University of Maryland [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3122.6200000000003s)]
*  There was one joke of a poll that was clearly manipulated as being circulated by neocons [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3130.5800000000004s)]
*  But there's poll after poll from both liberal [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3134.78s)]
*  Nonpartisan conservative institutions show there's not broad support for this in addition [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3139.2200000000003s)]
*  You now have within the [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3144.9s)]
*  administration [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3148.26s)]
*  a lot of people that don't look like the types of people that used to staff [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3149.7000000000003s)]
*  Republican administrations mainly George W. Bush administration, but else you could argue that the first Trump term in terms of foreign policy [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3154.98s)]
*  These are people like bridge Colby people like Joe Kent people like Michael Anton who have different ideas [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3160.98s)]
*  about American foreign policy and are much different than say the types of people that are Paul Wolfowitz or [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3168.66s)]
*  John Bolton would hire into administration [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3174.46s)]
*  So they they have they don't have a lot of people within the power structure right now [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3177.42s)]
*  At least on the political side with ins the career side in the military. Absolutely [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3184.14s)]
*  And then in addition you have to acknowledge is that there's now an institutional structure that didn't exist in 2016 of [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3189.7000000000003s)]
*  organizations that [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3196.7400000000002s)]
*  are able to get a [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3198.6200000000003s)]
*  Message out around foreign policy that a stat that the challenge is what you know Ben Rhodes called the blob [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3201.1000000000004s)]
*  Even though he's a card-carrying member of the blob these traditional organizations that push for American primacy and intervention. So [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3207.34s)]
*  You have a lot of pieces coming together that show that that [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3214.9s)]
*  neoconservatism on the right is is in retreat but [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3220.6200000000003s)]
*  That's in a lot of cases when movements can be most dangerous is that I I really sense in a lot of ways [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3224.46s)]
*  Why they have gone all out is because they're desperate is they see [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3231.14s)]
*  Particularly on the right the younger cohort coming up and we talked about this [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3236.06s)]
*  Why these people make you and me look like Paul Wolfowitz in terms of foreign policy beliefs? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3239.2000000000003s)]
*  I feel very I mean, I always say this but I feel very moderate [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3244.14s)]
*  I am very moderate just by temperament and I [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3247.7000000000003s)]
*  Don't meet really any moderate young people in these questions at all and they see that so that's why there's such an all-out [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3251.1s)]
*  Effort right now to push this because they think it's their last chance. I think they're right. I [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3258.7799999999997s)]
*  Think they're right [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3266.02s)]
*  So I think even now [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3268.14s)]
*  We're sort of officially clinging to the idea that Israel's goal here is a non-nuclear Iran [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3271.58s)]
*  That's not true. Their goal is regime change. I think it's fair to say [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3279.22s)]
*  But I do think Donald Trump's goal is not regime change [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3283.3s)]
*  I don't think he wants to be I know he doesn't want to be in a regime change where he's doesn't want to run [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3285.82s)]
*  To have a bomb. He said that a million times [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3289.74s)]
*  My question is a practical one. Is it possible? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3292.38s)]
*  To shut down a nuclear program with an air campaign. I [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3296.9s)]
*  Think you can roll it back. I think you can severely damage it. But [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3300.86s)]
*  Look, I'll use an argument that the advocates of the Iraq war made is that [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3305.7s)]
*  You can't truly shut down a weapons of mass destruction campaign with certain people in charge of the country [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3312.02s)]
*  You can't truly shut it down because you can't trust inspectors. You can't truly trust intelligence [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3319.46s)]
*  They were doing that in a very manipulative way, but there's a sliver of truth in that [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3326.8199999999997s)]
*  So if you truly want to get rid of an Iranian nuclear weapon program and make sure there it's totally dismantled [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3330.58s)]
*  it's likely going to require a regime change or some type of occupation or [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3339.7s)]
*  you know [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3345.7s)]
*  Invasion that may sound extreme. But if you stop and think about it, that's that's the truth [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3347.42s)]
*  Now you can roll it again. Well, so I have thought about it, but not as deeply as you have I would bet [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3353.82s)]
*  Can you flesh that out a little bit? Why? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3359.64s)]
*  Why would an air campaign not solve the nuclear problem? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3362.2400000000002s)]
*  Because you would need to verify that all the centrifuges are destroyed you need to verify that all the knowledge both [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3366.6s)]
*  You know scientists [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3374.78s)]
*  You know other engineers that that they are accounted for in some cases killed that there's no files remaining [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3378.0s)]
*  And that all the centrifuges all the different pieces all the nuclear material [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3385.94s)]
*  The triggers anything that could be part of this are destroyed and then any development of the delivery systems [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3390.94s)]
*  It is it is incredibly difficult to do that [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3397.46s)]
*  It's impossible to do that purely through air. You're gonna need [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3401.7400000000002s)]
*  Inspections you're gonna need people on the ground verifying this and again [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3405.7400000000002s)]
*  What we've seen before is the argument that the inspectors aren't gonna find everything [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3409.7400000000002s)]
*  So I think you can kind of see where this is going [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3414.58s)]
*  and so [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3417.7400000000002s)]
*  The argument likely that you're gonna see and it's not totally incorrect [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3418.94s)]
*  Is that to truly get rid of the threat of a nuclear Iran an Islamic Republic with a nuclear bomb is you're gonna need? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3422.98s)]
*  regime change and so as I said previously that's why in my mind this really isn't about a [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3429.6800000000003s)]
*  Nuclear bomb and I think I want to be clear for President Trump it is and for a lot of [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3436.86s)]
*  Good people who rightly are concerned about nuclear ready [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3440.84s)]
*  It is about that but for a lot of others it's about regime change [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3445.32s)]
*  I think that the consequences of that for the United States for the Middle East even for Israel [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3448.8s)]
*  Have not been thought through because a lot of people just like in Iraq [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3454.92s)]
*  They aren't thinking about what comes next if we get rid of Iran, but we just on Republic [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3459.0s)]
*  We just had the Iraq War. I mean that was it only started 22 years ago [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3464.6s)]
*  And we still have troops there [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3471.36s)]
*  We just got out of Afghanistan a few years ago after 20 years like we the memory is not just fresh [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3472.92s)]
*  It's not even a memory. It's still a present reality. We still have troops there. What are you talking about? I mean [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3479.36s)]
*  Iraq is a thriving liberal democracy [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3485.04s)]
*  Afghanistan [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3488.56s)]
*  Just achieved a hundred percent female literacy. I don't I'm like which was always which was always the goal [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3489.92s)]
*  What what you know, I don't know what you're talking about [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3496.14s)]
*  But you know joking aside is [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3497.92s)]
*  There's still a lot of people who think we can do this that we can actually [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3503.16s)]
*  Change a regime and instill liberalism through the the the point of the barrel of a gun [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3510.8s)]
*  That there is still that thinking in Washington DC that they have learned nothing from Iraq from Syria from Libya from Afghanistan from Yemen [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3517.52s)]
*  From other places it just it does not work [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3526.34s)]
*  My problem is bigger which is what happens to the American Empire, which is obviously contracting [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3530.7400000000002s)]
*  We don't have the will or the money to sustain it at current levels obviously [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3537.2200000000003s)]
*  You know we are challenged [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3542.34s)]
*  by China and [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3544.46s)]

*  You know supremacy [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3548.9s)]
*  Over shipping lanes and over the air and all this, you know, like things are changing really really fast [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3550.9s)]
*  So the Empire is getting smaller [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3555.2200000000003s)]
*  But there's got to be a way to unwind it [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3558.46s)]
*  Slowly thoughtfully with minimal damage. I think our adversaries not even enemies [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3562.3s)]
*  But just challengers to our position would like to to crumble in one day [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3568.2000000000003s)]
*  So there's this incentive to really kick the legs out from under America right now. Do you feel that? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3572.7400000000002s)]
*  I believe so. Yeah, I I think so and [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3579.1s)]
*  There there again I we there's a lot of people I think in China that would love us to see bogged down in the Middle East [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3584.7799999999997s)]
*  You and I you know are [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3593.74s)]
*  We don't believe that we should be involved in the Ukrainian war [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3596.2999999999997s)]
*  But the red if you're somebody that thinks that that, you know, Ukraine is the most important thing for a liberal democracy [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3600.4s)]
*  This war is gonna make it harder if not impossible to support Ukraine [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3607.26s)]
*  You know, it's gonna make it harder. Why is that? Why is that? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3612.62s)]
*  Why would a war with Iran make it impossible to continue supporting Ukraine's good question. So [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3615.78s)]
*  After the October 7th attacks [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3621.82s)]
*  You had Joe Biden go on 60 minutes and say [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3625.1800000000003s)]
*  After he was asked by the host and forget what host it was, but he was asked [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3629.38s)]
*  Are we gonna be able to support both Israel and Ukraine and you know, his dying brain said oh, come on man [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3633.02s)]
*  Of course we can we're the most powerful country ever. We've we won World War two [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3639.26s)]
*  Of course, we can do both and a week later [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3642.94s)]
*  The United States was forced to redirect a shipment of artillery shells [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3646.26s)]
*  from Ukraine to Israel to support them in their fight against Hamas and [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3651.02s)]
*  That right there just shattered the illusion that we can do both [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3655.5s)]
*  Of artillery shells so pretty low-tech stuff right and we had about [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3659.02s)]
*  I believe six seven months prior to October 7th [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3665.2599999999998s)]
*  When Netanyahu was out of power for a bit, I think was Holly Bennett was in charge [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3670.18s)]
*  He allowed the you're not allowed but signed off on the United States to pull all [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3678.8199999999997s)]
*  Our artillery shells out of a pre-positioned stockpile to give them to the Ukrainians to support them in their ultimately failed [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3685.34s)]
*  Counter-offensive so when October 7th kicked off they needed certain types of ammunition [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3691.7400000000002s)]
*  The stockpile that we had staged to support Israel in times of crisis was drained and we could not refill it [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3696.22s)]
*  Because we were giving the Ukrainians more artillery shells [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3702.38s)]
*  per month and we could [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3706.62s)]
*  Produce so we were drawing down our stockpiles to very low levels now. That's just artillery [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3709.3s)]
*  I don't at least right now think there's gonna be a lot of artillery [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3714.42s)]
*  Battles, I at least I hope not if that happens. It's gotten really bad, but the most precious [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3718.98s)]
*  Munition and [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3725.62s)]
*  Asset military asset in the world right now is air defense. So the Ukrainians need [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3727.3s)]
*  Patriot missiles and [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3733.86s)]
*  There's been a lot of discussion in the press. That's Zolinski's number one demand when he talks to the United States [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3736.06s)]
*  You want patriot missiles? Well, the United States is gonna need a lot of patriot missiles [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3741.86s)]
*  To defend our troops and a war with Iran. So if a war with Iran kicks off and we're firing through [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3747.78s)]
*  Our supply patriot missiles. We just simply aren't gonna be able to give the Ukrainians anymore. Sounds like we're under supplied [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3753.9s)]
*  Absolutely, we are and this again a lot of this we can talk about ideology all day, but the end of the day [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3760.5800000000004s)]
*  This is really a math problem we were talking about that earlier with the race that I ran in Iraq are in or excuse me [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3767.24s)]
*  I ran in Israel [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3773.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, it's [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3776.0s)]
*  our our ability to sustain fights like this for long periods of time is extremely limited and [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3778.7599999999998s)]
*  You're you're you're in a very precarious situation as a result of this and what do I do with a trillion dollars a year exactly? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3787.04s)]
*  It's a good question no for real I'm not being mean I mean I respect there are some people in the military [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3794.6400000000003s)]
*  Officers I respect not a ton but some I've met some really smart ones, but like no one thought ahead [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3801.36s)]
*  You can't even produce enough [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3807.4s)]
*  Artillery to supply Ukraine and Israel not huge countries like that. What is that? So [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3809.48s)]
*  If you look at a [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3817.96s)]
*  System like the Iron Dome in Israel now [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3820.64s)]
*  Everybody kind of talks about they call Israel's entire system the Iron Dome. It's really Iron Dome is [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3824.44s)]
*  Designed to shoot down cheap rockets from Hamas and Hezbollah, right? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3832.8s)]
*  The systems are being used now are David sling and the aero system and then our fad system and some of our naval ships [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3836.16s)]
*  Yeah [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3843.2400000000002s)]
*  but the Iron Dome is designed to be a little more cheap and [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3844.56s)]
*  And to shoot more in mass [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3849.36s)]
*  We don't have enough systems similar to that where we can produce a lot of things in mass and in quantity [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3852.68s)]
*  We focus on building these expensive systems with a lot of bells and whistles [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3861.08s)]
*  because we still haven't adapted to the fact that [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3865.92s)]
*  You know these wars that are quick and cheap and easy [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3870.76s)]
*  Are not necessarily cheap but but are relatively quick [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3875.48s)]
*  We don't use a lot of expensive munitions that those are few and gonna be few and far between if not exist in the future [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3878.08s)]
*  So our defense industrial base still has an adapt to the fact that we just need to to produce more [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3884.64s)]
*  Really cheaper and in some cases less advanced weapons in larger scale [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3891.68s)]
*  Instead of building these highly advanced weapons with all these bells and whistles [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3897.92s)]
*  In in smaller numbers like right now again this public knowledge we only produce about [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3902.1200000000003s)]
*  I'd say a hundred a hundred fifty and I could it could actually be lower [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3908.36s)]
*  Interceptors so ammunition for the fad system, which is our most advanced anti-ballistic missile system. We have only produced [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3913.1600000000003s)]
*  nine of around nine hundred to a thousand fad interceptors [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3920.2400000000002s)]
*  Just nine hundred to a thousand. That's total. I'm not talking launchers. I'm talking the rounds for them [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3925.52s)]
*  so Iran has about [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3931.56s)]
*  Depends on the estimate about two to three thousand ballistic missiles that can reach Israel and maybe it's probably significantly less [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3935.0s)]
*  But Israelis, but you see how this quickly becomes a math problem. We've only built between nine hundred thousand [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3941.6s)]
*  They have two thousand up to two thousand the types of missiles that [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3947.2s)]
*  The fad is designed to shoot down and if you're assuming a hundred percent success rate, you don't have enough interceptor again [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3952.56s)]
*  I refer to the previous question. What do we spend a trillion dollars a year on we spend it on those, you know hard to produce [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3957.88s)]
*  Expensive systems and some of them we have to admit are very capable at 35 [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3966.52s)]
*  It's gotten a lot of criticism over the years [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3971.6400000000003s)]
*  But I think we've adapted and turned into a fairly capable system [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3973.3s)]
*  Some people may disagree with me on that, but I think it is a capable system [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3977.1600000000003s)]
*  But we haven't been able to build and that has a lot to do with how we funded it [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3981.48s)]
*  Enough of those or enough of certain types of of ammunition [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3985.9599999999996s)]
*  To really fight a long extended war against an enemy that has either a lot of people [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3990.72s)]
*  Or can produce a lot of things like cheap drones or cheap rockets or cheap, you know indirect fire weapons [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=3996.8799999999997s)]
*  We just are not quite set up for that type of fight yet [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4004.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean Russia still occupies eastern Ukraine [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4007.06s)]
*  Exactly and and for that I mean that is where it should have become patently obvious to us [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4010.04s)]
*  That we have to change how we do this and and again credit to some of my colleagues at DOD is they know it [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4015.7999999999997s)]
*  We fortunately just confirmed for undersecretary of acquisition and sustainment Mike Duffy [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4023.04s)]
*  I think Steve Feinberg knows that they know but they have a big fight. They're gonna be fighting a lot of entrenched [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4028.4199999999996s)]
*  Interests to it seems like the wrong time to start swaggering around trying to start new wars with people [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4035.2s)]
*  Yeah, exactly [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4041.6s)]
*  We are trying to fix a lot of things [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4043.24s)]
*  and [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4045.7999999999997s)]
*  We're gonna have to put a lot of those things on a back burner if we get into a major regional fight [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4047.0s)]
*  Um if [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4054.8399999999997s)]
*  We throw these and I again the I don't know this is gonna happen [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4057.68s)]
*  But the president's stated goal is to make sure that Iran doesn't have nuclear weapons [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4061.52s)]
*  I just want to restate you don't believe as a practical matter that's achievable with a couple bunker buster strikes. I [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4066.4399999999996s)]
*  Do not and again, I hope I'm wrong. I think the best the least worst option is an [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4074.12s)]
*  imperfect diplomatic solution [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4081.2799999999997s)]
*  That is that is the best least risky option [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4084.2799999999997s)]
*  Probably the only option. I mean you can't [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4089.16s)]
*  Force your wife to love you [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4091.7999999999997s)]
*  Can't you know beat her up till she loves you you have to in the end everything is voluntary have to convince people and [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4094.3599999999997s)]
*  Someone who's to well, you're the military guy you tell me [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4100.44s)]
*  I mean if someone is determined to commit violence against who's pretty hard to stop it if he's still alive, right? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4102.88s)]
*  You deter it and that's where deterrence [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4108.44s)]
*  Comes into effect here is that there are [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4112.16s)]
*  Different levers and I've said this before is yes. You do need a credible military option. Yeah. Yeah for [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4115.04s)]
*  diplomacy to work but [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4121.24s)]
*  The I think everyone agrees even well not everyone but I think [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4124.12s)]
*  Everyone who's approaching this in a sane manner [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4129.0s)]
*  understands just like with the Ukraine war is that this is [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4132.839999999999s)]
*  The least worst way for this to end is with a robust diplomatic agreement again [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4137.839999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's not so robust. It's less than perfect that does restrain [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4144.4s)]
*  Iranian nuclear ambitions. I got a wonder about the [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4148.24s)]
*  troops who are sure who are you know at the barrel end of this [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4153.28s)]
*  Thing [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4157.280000000001s)]
*  If they read the New York Times they learned that the US what you know really had nothing to do with any of those [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4158.52s)]
*  Just true Israel shows up and says we're doing this and now we're following along and participating to some extent [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4163.52s)]
*  Maybe now to a greater extent. What do they think of that? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4169.6s)]
*  It feels like what doesn't feel like it's true we were pushed into this by another country [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4174.56s)]
*  Is that if you're serving in uniform away from your family risking death, is that like a good reason? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4179.12s)]
*  Do you think that's adequate [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4185.08s)]
*  Or do people not think like that when they're deployed? I think most folks are gonna have those thoughts but they're gonna [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4187.56s)]
*  Put them down and they're gonna focus on the mission. I think that's what they they have to do [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4194.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, of course [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4198.8s)]
*  I totally can't you know when you're in the middle of a you know when you're about to drop bombs on Forto and you're a [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4199.64s)]
*  B2 pilot you can't in your head be [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4205.64s)]
*  Wondering about you know the nature of American foreign policy and how we got here [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4208.4800000000005s)]
*  But when you get home, yeah and and look I have to be honest here [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4215.04s)]
*  And I've told people this I'm somebody who [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4221.24s)]
*  Does believe the United States should have a partnership and support Israel? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4224.8s)]
*  I think that an ideal world is that we would have a security architecture where you would have [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4228.32s)]
*  You know Gulf Arabs cooperating with Israel that would help prevent the rise of a regional hegemon and a global hegemon coming in [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4235.72s)]
*  And [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4244.04s)]
*  You know dominating the region I [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4245.360000000001s)]
*  See benefits to that, but I am concerned that if this is perceived [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4248.88s)]
*  as a [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4255.84s)]
*  war for [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4257.56s)]
*  Israel [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4259.68s)]
*  What what impact is that gonna have on? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4261.320000000001s)]
*  Support for us doing some of those things and I've tried to communicate to people who are strong supporters of the state of Israel [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4264.56s)]
*  That that's one of these second and third order implications that you need to be aware of is what is gonna happen to popular support [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4272.56s)]
*  For the state Israel, I think you and Steve Bannon talked about this [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4278.6s)]
*  Well, and and there is another there's another aspect here, too [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4281.0s)]
*  You know [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4285.4s)]
*  Right now in the region [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4286.72s)]
*  The Gulf Arab states are wanting to pursue better relations with Israel for a lot of reasons business opportunities [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4290.32s)]
*  For sure other things but one of the biggest things pushing them together [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4297.04s)]
*  Is the threat of Iran? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4301.96s)]
*  so if Iran [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4304.4400000000005s)]
*  Collapses, it's a failed state if if they're not [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4307.28s)]
*  There I think in a lot of ways [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4311.4800000000005s)]
*  Again, there's there's still gonna be Iran and it's not clear [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4314.04s)]
*  A lot of the regime change advocates can't articulate really what comes next [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4317.08s)]
*  The Shah's failed son probably is gonna go back to Tehran and take over these these nuts and the MEK aren't gonna come and take [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4320.72s)]
*  over but [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4326.68s)]
*  You know [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4328.8s)]
*  Whatever is there if it's less of a threat if it's if it's not the same threat again, that's probably good [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4330.68s)]
*  But what's the unintended consequence of that? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4338.400000000001s)]
*  Just like the unintended consequence of removing Saddam Hussein was empowering Iran [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4341.08s)]
*  If you don't have that threat posed by Iran anymore that in some ways balances [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4345.400000000001s)]
*  against the Gulf Arabs [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4352.04s)]
*  They're gonna look at [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4354.320000000001s)]
*  Israel and they may have concerns and they may go back to where they were before [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4356.16s)]
*  And be hostile to to Israel [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4360.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's important to remember that for most of the Cold War [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4363.16s)]
*  Israel pursued a foreign policy that was rooted in something called the periphery doctrine and was very smart [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4368.4400000000005s)]
*  It was driven by Ben Gurion where they dealt with a hostile Arab world [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4375.0s)]
*  Particularly the states that were supported by the Soviets so they [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4380.56s)]
*  Prioritized building relations with non-arab countries on the periphery of the Middle East. So primarily Turkey [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4383.8s)]
*  Yep, Iran and Ethiopia and that was to balance [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4390.06s)]
*  Against the Arabs and that's why Israel even after the Islamic Revolution, even though Khomeini was, you know screaming death to Israel [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4394.9800000000005s)]
*  That's why initially after Iraq invaded Iran Israel was their main arm supplier and other countries started selling them stuff [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4402.5s)]
*  That's why Israel was such an integral part of Iran Contra [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4409.700000000001s)]
*  Why he had a lot of American neo-conservatives who are supporters of Israel that were advocates in the 80s people [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4413.780000000001s)]
*  Like Michael Aden [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4419.98s)]
*  Elliott Abrams of still trying to pursue good relations with Iran [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4421.259999999999s)]
*  even though he had Khomeini shouting death or America death to Israel and [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4425.339999999999s)]
*  That's why up until the end of the Cold War and the defeat of Iraq and the Gulf War that [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4428.82s)]
*  Israel viewed Iraq as a bigger threat as [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4435.259999999999s)]
*  Opposed to Iran and they so they were quietly supporting Iran in some cases openly [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4439.459999999999s)]
*  Even though you had this very anti-semitic anti [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4446.5s)]
*  Israel regime and and they and honestly it was incredibly it that was I believe that was a smart thing to do [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4451.18s)]
*  But after the end of the Cold War after Saddam the the country they viewed as more threatening was degraded [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4458.42s)]
*  Iran became the bigger threat. So I tell that story [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4465.86s)]
*  to say is [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4469.38s)]
*  What happens after you don't have Iran is does Turkey become more powerful [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4470.94s)]
*  Do other countries start to band together and out of fear of what Israel's done and Iran and so I'm really concerned [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4476.259999999999s)]
*  That people aren't thinking through what could happen here then not to mention what could happen in in in Iran [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4484.379999999999s)]
*  You know, I was listening. I've only listened to a small part of your interview with with Ted Cruz [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4491.339999999999s)]
*  but he was saying something about [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4494.98s)]
*  How would be good if the Islamic regime was gone and through a popular uprising yeah, I an ideal world you'd have a [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4496.54s)]
*  you know a [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4504.1s)]
*  bunch of Iranian liberals rise up and overthrow the [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4506.1s)]
*  Islamic regime and you'd have a popular democracy in Iran, but it's more likely you could have something you could have something worse [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4510.22s)]
*  Replace the moas you could have Iran break into a civil war [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4517.5s)]
*  You have a lot of ethnic minorities that are looking for independence if [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4523.54s)]
*  Iraq hadn't invaded Iran [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4528.179999999999s)]
*  In 1980 there's a chance. There's a world where Iran could have [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4530.62s)]
*  devolved into [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4536.299999999999s)]
*  Major civil war because all these ethnic minorities that were trying to break away 40% of the country. Yes, so [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4537.66s)]
*  That's a lot a lot of history there, but [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4545.0199999999995s)]
*  This is what is not being discussed about the risks around regime change that really worries me and it's a repeat of what happened [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4549.34s)]
*  Iraq in 2000 people pushing and literally just don't care at all. And in fact [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4555.78s)]
*  Chaos in neighboring states. I think is bad for the world and including Israel. I think it's bad for everybody [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4561.02s)]
*  But there are some people think it's good. I mean that is a world that is a view. Yeah [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4568.02s)]
*  abetting chaos on purpose [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4573.34s)]
*  Yes, it's kind of like so I was just in Europe and was meeting with European diplomats was very interesting [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4576.14s)]
*  And some of them were open [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4584.18s)]
*  We saying we want the Ukrainian war to continue because it benefits us and these were from countries [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4585.9800000000005s)]
*  I won't you know chat of house rules. I won't say who [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4593.18s)]
*  But these are from countries that were supposedly the strongest supporters of Ukraine saying we want the war to continue not not we want Ukraine [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4596.06s)]
*  to win [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4603.78s)]
*  We want the war to continue why? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4605.22s)]
*  well for them they perceive Russia as [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4608.22s)]
*  A threat and that if Russia stops fighting in Ukraine, then they'll reorient against them. Even though there's really not [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4612.26s)]
*  Putin has not [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4622.46s)]
*  Expressed the attend as clearly as some people like to say it's so funny [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4624.34s)]
*  I mean if I would just I know the Brits feel this way, especially oh, yeah [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4627.900000000001s)]
*  They've convinced themselves that Russia is their greatest enemy it's bizarre [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4632.0199999999995s)]
*  But you know if I were Putin I would offer free first-class trips to Moscow so they could see that like [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4637.66s)]
*  Moscow was so much nicer than any place in Great Britain. It's like not even close. There's no part of Great Britain [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4645.179999999999s)]
*  That's as nice as Moscow. It's like [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4651.34s)]
*  Probably an upgrade for them. I mean their their leadership is so bad their country's so degraded. I [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4653.78s)]
*  Think I think a lot of them I think the Brits are certain I will say I think they're starting to come around a bit [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4660.14s)]
*  It's some weird that they're mad at Putin. Why aren't they mad at Keir Starmer? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4667.66s)]
*  Why aren't they mad at the concert fake conservative Rishi Sunak and you know what I mean? I think part of it is [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4671.5s)]
*  For them and I'm not by no means an expert on British politics. I enjoyed working with some people [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4678.18s)]
*  The British Defense establishment was in the Pentagon I have a lot of respect for him, but they're still kind of this [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4685.3s)]
*  grasping at trying to be a global imperial power when they're [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4691.86s)]
*  You know [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4696.139999999999s)]
*  They don't have the resources or the power of course [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4697.46s)]
*  I feel sorry for them un sort of but on the other hand, it's like every Western country has the same syndrome where [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4700.16s)]
*  They're they're well deserved frustrations about the decline of their own countries are channeled into hate [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4707.74s)]
*  People thousands of miles away [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4714.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you're in a country where people are just dropping dead at 25 of fentanyl ods [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4716.9s)]
*  Like no one can get a job after graduating college and you can't afford a house and can't get married or have kids and you're like [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4721.7s)]
*  It's I'm mad at potent. I'm mad at the ayatollahs [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4727.22s)]
*  It's like you don't even mean it's yeah weird kind of like [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4731.099999999999s)]
*  Unwillingness to face the truth, which is no well, you've been betrayed by your own leaders. It's easier to point [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4735.3s)]
*  It's easier a point abroad than look, you know, and you've seen that you've seen that throughout history [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4741.7s)]
*  You know the British dealt with that in the Falklands war [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4746.5s)]
*  Why did Argentina invade the Falklands when they did because the Argentina junta was having? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4749.44s)]
*  severe problems [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4755.34s)]
*  Exactly. And why did that sure respond the way that she did because she'd also just come out of these strikes and like [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4756.44s)]
*  That helped her tremendously. No, there's all kinds of baked-in incentives to war [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4763.54s)]
*  I just you do wish some of these countries would take that hostility which again is well [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4767.16s)]
*  Earned like they have a right to be hostile and focus it [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4772.36s)]
*  Against their own leaders and affect regime change in their own countries, you know [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4776.5599999999995s)]
*  They just these countries were they deserve regime change a lot of these countries in the West [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4780.18s)]
*  Yeah, and it's again for me [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4784.96s)]
*  I've been to Ukraine and went to Ukraine last year during the war and I came away with a lot of sympathy and respect [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4787.5599999999995s)]
*  For a lot of Ukrainians I came away with a lot of immense I'll just use the word hatred [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4794.2s)]
*  Shouldn't you know let it linger but it was angry at some of the Western supporters of Ukraine a lot of Ukraine's leaders [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4800.92s)]
*  Why tell me why you felt that way [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4809.76s)]
*  Because at the end of the day a lot of these people's strategy is to continue to send young Ukrainians in [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4812.68s)]
*  Pursuit of a victory that they know they can't win [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4820.44s)]
*  Yes, and they're doing it just so they can feel good about themselves just so they can say we're standing up to Putin [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4824.38s)]
*  and you know, I I gotta say like [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4829.74s)]
*  You know, we haven't talked about the Ukrainian drone, you know issue but [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4833.16s)]
*  last month the [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4838.96s)]
*  Ambassador Ukraine resigned this woman named Bridget Brink and [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4841.88s)]
*  She made a big show of it she wrote a [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4845.639999999999s)]
*  Op-ed for the Detroit Free Press. She's probably gonna run for Congress in Michigan and [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4850.0s)]
*  It was a bunch of pablum. It was about [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4855.5199999999995s)]
*  You know how American needs to lead the free world [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4859.32s)]
*  how she was essentially ashamed that the President Trump's administration has recognized that the only way Ukraine's gonna survive as a nation is [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4861.759999999999s)]
*  Through a diplomatic settlement and she was she's saying that we were betraying our values and all this other nonsense [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4869.64s)]
*  She's a child. It was childish and she was the ambassador Ukraine [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4875.68s)]
*  I met her actually a joke when I went to Odessa the first time I interact [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4879.76s)]
*  I was never really directly but on a lot of calls with her when I was in administration and [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4883.320000000001s)]
*  She [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4889.76s)]
*  Could not articulate. How do you? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4891.0s)]
*  Achieve some semblance of Victor of the Ukrainians considering the fact that they don't have enough people and we don't have enough weapons to give [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4895.0s)]
*  Them she told a friend of mine at an event a cocktail event. Um that [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4900.74s)]
*  Her baseline demand was that Putin give back Crimea? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4905.48s)]
*  And it's like she didn't know what Crimea was she didn't understand [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4910.16s)]
*  I mean that basically like we'll have a nuclear war over Crimea is what she but she didn't even understand that was the implication [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4913.68s)]
*  Like she was like an idiot [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4919.96s)]
*  Most of the Ukrainian most most of the Ukrainian government obviously no government's unitary entity [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4922.32s)]
*  but there's an increasing number of people in the Ukrainian government including some folks that I [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4928.2s)]
*  Think a lot of I'm not gonna say who they are including some folks that I think would be surprising to people here [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4933.96s)]
*  Who recognize reality? They know Crimea is not coming back and those you know, those people in some ways are becoming [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4940.2s)]
*  the enemies [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4948.52s)]
*  Themselves and that's why you see more and more crackdowns and dissent in Ukraine why a lot of people are [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4950.4s)]
*  afraid to speak out and why honestly [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4958.04s)]
*  That major drone attack was launched the day before a negotiating team was going to Istanbul to meet with the Russians [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4960.5599999999995s)]
*  So what was I mean I don't the conventional view is there's no chance the Ukrainians could have pulled that off without the help [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4968.719999999999s)]
*  of NATO [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4976.24s)]
*  So can I heard you and Steve Bannon talking about this [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4979.24s)]
*  Here's here's my view. I know Steve has been asking a lot about this [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4984.12s)]
*  I actually don't believe that the upper echelons of the Pentagon the CIA [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4988.38s)]
*  White House State Department knew about this [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4993.679999999999s)]
*  The White House didn't know that there I think they're 100% correct because they would have been incredibly uncomfortable with [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=4997.12s)]
*  This happening the day before peace talks and I do have to say I think the same applies to CIA leadership, however, I do believe [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5004.04s)]
*  that [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5012.4400000000005s)]
*  there were [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5013.84s)]
*  elements of [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5014.84s)]
*  The military supporting [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5017.88s)]
*  Ukraine [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5020.2s)]
*  particularly through training and some of their intelligence sharing and probably elements of the intelligent community that supporting Ukraine [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5021.4800000000005s)]
*  that knew about this and didn't run it up the chain because [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5027.72s)]
*  They were worried that they would be told no because they had [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5031.32s)]
*  Started this plan under the previous administration and they knew the previous administration likely would have been comfortable with it [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5036.2s)]
*  But ours wouldn't so they they probably [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5043.24s)]
*  Suppressed that information from getting up the chain and I want to be clear [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5046.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm not casting aspersions on everybody in like European command [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5049.599999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of great officers great soldiers in Marine sailors airmen serving European command [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5053.24s)]
*  There's actually some really smart realistic members intelligence community that are serving on the Russia Ukraine portfolio [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5058.28s)]
*  But there's others that are still bought in like Bridget Brink to this idea that Ukraine [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5066.0s)]
*  Can achieve a victory in one way to do it is by these spectacular attacks [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5072.4s)]
*  That you know while may risk a little thing called nuclear war because we're attacking Russian strategic assets [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5077.32s)]
*  Nuclear war because we're attacking Russian strategic assets not just you know missile launchers and stuff and yeah, they have a role in [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5083.92s)]
*  The war in Ukraine, but they were all remember they also attacked a Russian nuclear submarine base in north of country [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5091.8s)]
*  So that was done first and foremost to undermine the peace talks [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5097.72s)]
*  I think going into Istanbul the day the next day and also to to invite some type of escalation [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5102.78s)]
*  Well, they've tried to kill Putin at least twice [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5109.68s)]
*  So yeah, yeah [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5112.320000000001s)]
*  And that leads to one of my last questions second to last question, which is why do we put up with that? I [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5114.96s)]
*  Mean if our job is to run the world or at least the West and I think most people in the US government [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5121.0s)]
*  I think that is our job [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5126.72s)]
*  Maintain the peace act in our interest etc. Etc [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5128.52s)]
*  Zelensky and a few people around him are actively [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5132.400000000001s)]
*  Subverting that he's not elected [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5136.64s)]
*  He rules by force [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5139.400000000001s)]
*  Ukraine is less free than Russia from what I can tell [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5141.76s)]
*  Like why are we continuing to send him money? Why don't we force them to leave? Why don't we I don't know render him somewhere? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5145.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't I don't get it. I [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5152.320000000001s)]
*  forget was [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5154.12s)]
*  If as you told me this or or you know, I have a [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5156.96s)]
*  Some British commentator said we're just really bad at being an empire. We don't understand the patron-client [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5162.68s)]
*  Relationship that was me. I thought that since December of 2003 in Baghdad. We're not good at this. We should yeah [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5169.76s)]
*  We were not good. Yeah, we were not built to be an empire. No the Brits were yeah [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5175.76s)]
*  The Brits definitely were but we are not you know, we were meant to be a republic an empire. Yep [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5179.92s)]
*  and I think [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5186.12s)]
*  We I will say this administration has started to change that I can't tell you how much the aid pause that we did [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5189.36s)]
*  Really freaked out the establishment and sent an important message Ukrainians, but also the Europeans [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5196.799999999999s)]
*  but there's still ways to go and I think we [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5202.5599999999995s)]
*  we need to [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5207.799999999999s)]
*  Really change that mental model about how partners and allies we work with partners allies [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5209.639999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean that we are telling him what to you know, we're dominating them in certain ways [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5214.96s)]
*  We're always trying to throw them under the bus that doesn't work either [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5220.639999999999s)]
*  But this idea that we let certain [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5224.5599999999995s)]
*  clients [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5227.32s)]
*  Do things constantly that are against our interest it benefit it doesn't benefit us in the long term [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5229.4s)]
*  It doesn't benefit these clients. I mean look at what happened in Afghanistan. I think that's a perfect example of that [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5234.24s)]
*  last question, um [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5240.639999999999s)]
*  If you had to bet do you think [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5244.28s)]
*  The US government is capable of [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5250.96s)]
*  Closing out this war in Iran [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5255.16s)]
*  like saying to [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5257.4s)]
*  Israel, you know, we've done enough like stop [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5260.0s)]
*  and [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5263.28s)]
*  If Donald Trump decides, you know [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5264.32s)]
*  he wanted to go back to the negotiating table since he would cough to a month again to meet with the [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5266.2s)]
*  Iranians and trying to hammer something out. Do we have the power to do that? I [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5271.48s)]
*  Think it's this is an interesting question. Are we talking about capability or willingness? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5276.04s)]
*  Both like could that actually happen is that really absolutely I I think that is that is entirely possible [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5281.3s)]
*  I say it's likely I don't know. Yeah, we can't know but you think it's possible. Of course. I mean we we have [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5288.34s)]
*  Done this before. I mean I I think [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5295.62s)]
*  You know with Israel specifically, you know, Ronald Reagan is considered a very pro-israel president [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5299.0199999999995s)]
*  He was a very pro-israel president for sure [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5307.22s)]
*  but there were times where where the feeling was is that [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5309.1s)]
*  Israel was not doing things our interest and we made that clear and we used our leverage to make sure that they were not [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5312.660000000001s)]
*  harming [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5320.5s)]
*  American interests and [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5321.780000000001s)]
*  I think [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5323.860000000001s)]
*  We perfectly have the capability to do that [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5325.58s)]
*  Again I I I we don't know how the next few days [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5332.660000000001s)]
*  Are gonna play out but it's it's definitely there is we have [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5337.14s)]
*  Tremendous amount of leverage over many parties in the Middle East over, you know many countries around the world for sure [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5341.740000000001s)]
*  We just have used it incredibly poorly [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5347.62s)]
*  Dan Caldwell, I keep reading about what an extremist you are. I think you're the most moderate person I've spoken to this month [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5352.42s)]
*  Who else are you interviewing? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5359.22s)]
*  Thank you. Are you are still on is Jelani coming? Yeah [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5361.740000000001s)]
*  Are you going to love Johnny we're totally pro-isis now, it's totally cool as long as Damascus [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5364.74s)]

*  There's a lot of good staff right now [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5421.66s)]
*  administration that are doing the Lord's work and I have to say [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5424.38s)]
*  Some of the things that are being said about them and how they're being undermined in the press and being accused of awful things is [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5430.06s)]
*  Absolutely disgusting [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5437.14s)]
*  Their candidly is an effort to run [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5439.06s)]
*  Somewhat of the same playbook against them. They did me it's like you're seeing these accusations a leaking right on the outs [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5441.900000000001s)]
*  Let's be honest [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5447.86s)]
*  That's a trick that people who want a bigger war are playing to stifle dissent [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5449.22s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware because if you dissent, you know, look as I said before you dissent and [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5455.0199999999995s)]
*  They make a decision to do something. It's your job to implement it, but they're trying to [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5461.38s)]
*  Snuff out any sort of process or debate right now by attacking and trying to accuse certain [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5468.38s)]
*  Groups of people whether it's in the White House the Pentagon ODNI State Department of leaking [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5473.62s)]
*  so they're scaring them away from from actually offering feedback and challenge and that's utterly disgusting and [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5479.66s)]
*  You know, I I know that there's a lot of good people in the White House and aren't gonna tolerate it [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5487.18s)]
*  they're not gonna be [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5492.18s)]
*  You know, they're not gonna be bullied by it but I think we acknowledge is happening and it's it's not surprising [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5495.780000000001s)]
*  But it still is utterly can I say one thing and you're definitely in this category? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5502.34s)]
*  But it's the people who've been targeted in general [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5506.9800000000005s)]
*  Are the most patriotic the most pro-american the most people whose views are the most consistent with the ones Donald Trump ran on [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5510.58s)]
*  I've noticed that I think it's true for you. It's certainly true for Tulsi [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5518.78s)]
*  They're also the people that when the president says we're doing this [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5521.54s)]
*  They're going to implement it and if they don't agree with it if it if it goes against their core beliefs so much [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5525.58s)]
*  Then they're gonna resign [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5532.719999999999s)]
*  They're not gonna do what Jim Jeffery who we're talking about earlier is gonna do [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5534.38s)]
*  They're not gonna do what people in the first term didn't undermine it. Is there gonna say Roger that and go forward? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5538.54s)]
*  That's what makes this whole thing even worse [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5546.86s)]
*  Yeah, they're attacking the best people because lying is not a crime telling the truth is [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5549.42s)]
*  Yeah, thank you, Dan. Thank you. I'm proud again [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5554.06s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show on one level that's not surprising that's what they do [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5561.14s)]
*  But on another level it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right now all the change taking place in our economy and our [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5567.04s)]
*  Politics with the wars won the cusp of fighting right now [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5573.78s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5577.18s)]
*  Rather than more and that is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5580.06s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. That's a waste of time [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5586.3s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google or we could find a way around it a way that you could actually get information [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5588.82s)]
*  That is true not intentionally deceptive the way to do that on YouTube [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5593.7s)]
*  We think it's just subscribe to our channel subscribe hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5598.2s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5605.14s)]
*  Actual news and information, so we hope that you'll do that [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbMKJPwfh4&t=5608.06s)]
