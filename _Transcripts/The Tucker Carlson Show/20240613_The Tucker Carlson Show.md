# Vince Everett Ellison Exposes the Lies Sold to Black America MLK, Hip Hop Culture, & Democrats
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o)
*  If you see your brother getting ready to get in anything, I don't care if he's wrong, you go with him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=0.0s)]
*  That's exactly how I grew up. That's exactly how I grew up. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5.2s)]
*  You defend your brother if I don't care if he's wrong. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8.0s)]
*  I don't want to see y'all fighting and arguing in the street. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=11.92s)]
*  If he's wrong, you go help him fight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=14.32s)]
*  Totally. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=16.4s)]
*  And Bobo kept me, my brother kept me in so much trouble behind there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=16.96s)]
*  That's how I grew up. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=19.68s)]
*  If your brother kills five people in a drug-related murder spree, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=21.52s)]
*  obviously we're against that, but get him a fake passport first. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=24.64s)]
*  Yeah, get him out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=27.84s)]
*  That's why I wasn't angry at, I don't like Cuomo, but him being supporting his brother. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=29.52s)]
*  I defended him too. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=35.76s)]
*  Yeah, I said, no, no, man, I got to defend his brother. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=36.64s)]
*  That's exactly what I said. And that's why... [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=39.12s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=42.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=43.44s)]
*  I don't care what, he's your brother. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=44.0s)]
*  He's your brother. You stand with your brother, period. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=45.92s)]
*  And I didn't like them firing me. Now, suspend him. Send him home. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=49.2s)]
*  That's how I felt. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=52.56s)]
*  But don't fire the man because of that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=53.44s)]
*  And then all these people I knew who I thought were decent people are like, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=55.2s)]
*  no, he broke the rules. It's like he broke the rules defending his brother. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  His brother. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  And I don't like his brother at all. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  I don't like his brother. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  But you know, when it comes to that absolute rule, it's an absolute rule. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=69.04s)]
*  And I thought, how are these people raised? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  I was at a bachelor party in Newport, Rhode Island, like 20 years ago. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I worked at CNN. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=82.88s)]
*  And we were, of course, drunk. My brother was much drunker than I was. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=84.8s)]
*  And we were walking down the street. My brother got in a fistfight with someone on the street. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=88.72s)]
*  And the guy punched him right up, punched him, knocked him down. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=92.64s)]
*  And I thought to myself, I can hear my father's voice. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  Don't let anybody touch your brother. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=99.36s)]
*  So I knew I was about to get my ass kicked. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=102.0s)]
*  And I had a Polaroid camera. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=104.64s)]
*  Remember those Polaroid cameras? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=108.56s)]
*  We were playing some game with Polaroid cameras, I don't even remember. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=109.76s)]
*  And I took it and I thought, I'm about to get slaughtered, but I couldn't help it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=112.56s)]
*  And I went and I hit the guy in the face with a Polaroid camera. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=116.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=118.48s)]
*  Broke on his face. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=119.12s)]
*  Hit the weapon. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=120.0s)]
*  And the guy just kicked the shit out of me. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=121.12s)]
*  Right in the face, knocked me backwards on a broken glass. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=123.28s)]
*  I cut my hands. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  I had a huge black eye. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=127.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  I had to go on TV the next day with a black eye. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=129.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=130.96s)]
*  I did not want to fight the guy. I'm sure it was my brother's fault. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=131.44s)]
*  And I said to my brother, like, why did you, you know, you obligate me [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  to get a black eye in your defense. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=138.96s)]
*  I knew I was going to lose. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=140.88s)]
*  Believe me, man. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=143.44s)]
*  But I could hear my dad being like, don't anybody touch your brother. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=144.32s)]
*  Anybody touch your brother. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  Stand with it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=149.44s)]
*  Stand with it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=150.64s)]
*  But you know, man, it's again, that's why your dad reminds me a lot of my dad. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=151.28s)]
*  He was one of those, he's just rote minded, hardscrabble, right and wrong. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=155.76s)]
*  One of these men's men, men. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  And again, you know, we've feminized men. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=164.64s)]
*  That's one of the things they want to do in this culture. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  So when did that start and why did it start? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  Civil rights movement, man. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  All those communists and Marxists got involved with all these counterculture people, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  the feminists, and they wanted power. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=180.8s)]
*  And the way you get power is by feminizing men. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  LGBTQ comes in. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=187.44s)]
*  We are a threat to them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  John Wayne's a threat, man. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ is a threat. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  The guys that stand up and say, no, it's this way. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  Because they wanted to change everything. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=198.96s)]
*  They hated J. Edgar Hoover. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=201.44s)]
*  Not because J. Edgar Hoover hated black people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  Please. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  They hated J. Edgar Hoover because J. Edgar Hoover hated communists. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=205.52s)]
*  And he kicked all their asses. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=208.08s)]
*  He took them all down. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=210.24s)]
*  And when Hoover died, they had to destroy Hoover to make it seem like that the civil [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=211.68s)]
*  rights movement and all the crap they were doing with the black Panthers and whatnot [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=215.68s)]
*  was successful. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=218.72s)]
*  These people were horrible people. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  The Panthers were selling dope on the street. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=221.28s)]
*  They were in fighting and beating women. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=224.72s)]
*  Huey Newton beat Bobby Seale with a bullwhip. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=227.92s)]
*  It was insanity going on there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  They were just a mob. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  But they would take these people and they would elevate them and say that this is how [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  you need to be because we need you as suicide bombers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  The way Hamas has this martyr's wall, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=242.0s)]
*  So that they can have these little children growing up wanting to kill themselves for [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  They're training us to be the exact same way. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=250.16s)]
*  Marching, sweating while they're setting up in Beverly Hills and Manhattan. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=252.88s)]
*  Drinking their little tequilas and whatnot. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=257.76s)]
*  Black people out there doing all the marching, all the sweating, all and getting the hell [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=260.24s)]
*  beat out of them and put in jail. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  We're their shock troops. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=265.84s)]
*  We're their Hitler youth. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=267.84s)]
*  That's why they need us. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=269.68s)]
*  And they're going to keep that going. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  So but to feminize, so the idea is to make men feminism because you take them off the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  table as a threat. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=279.76s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=280.56s)]
*  They're not a threat anymore whatsoever. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=281.52s)]
*  And you and I are both old enough for them with the whole feminist movement with the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=283.28s)]
*  bra burning and, oh, boy, I don't need a man. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=286.72s)]
*  We're equal to men. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=291.92s)]
*  Marriage is like slavery. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=293.6s)]
*  All of that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=296.0s)]
*  And we all that that was a Marxist construct. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=296.56s)]
*  So that wasn't about liberation? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=298.56s)]
*  Oh, it was. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  I think that they tried. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  They sold it as that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=302.32000000000005s)]
*  It was about destroying the family. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=304.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=306.24s)]
*  Because when you destroy the family, when you destroy the whole concept of family, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=307.12s)]
*  the government has to come in and take over. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  And that's what it did. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=313.68s)]
*  The black family got destroyed behind and now the white family is going down, too. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  And America's in a death spiral. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=318.72s)]
*  Man, they destroyed us from within. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=320.16s)]
*  You remember Abraham Lincoln said, right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=322.0s)]
*  He said, nobody can cross the Pacific Ocean and take America by force. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  We must live as free men or die by suicide. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  We have to destroy ourselves. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  How do you destroy America? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  You must take out God, drive it mad, and help us destroy one another. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=336.24s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening now. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=342.16s)]
*  No other no foreign nation is destroying America. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  America is committing suicide in real time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=346.64s)]
*  Well, you and I, as we get older, said, and watching and say, oh my God, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=350.56s)]
*  what can we do to stop this? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=354.8s)]
*  So the civil rights movement, the official civil rights movement [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=356.08s)]
*  was and is still described as a Christian movement. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=362.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=364.88s)]
*  Was it? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=366.48s)]
*  No, anything but. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=367.12s)]
*  You know, it's been a lot of great scholarship done recently. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=369.12s)]
*  Virgil Walker is now a lot of good scholarship. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  Jane McArthur stands for good scholarship. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=375.76s)]
*  And they have, I mean, John McArthur, they looked at King's papers from Stanford. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=378.64s)]
*  Come to find out that King wasn't even a Christian. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  He wasn't a Christian? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=387.67999999999995s)]
*  No, they said he didn't believe in the deity of Christ, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=388.55999999999995s)]
*  didn't believe in the virgin birth, didn't believe in the resurrection, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=390.88s)]
*  didn't believe in hell. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=393.76s)]
*  If you don't believe in those things, you can't be a Christian. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  No, that's true. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=398.88s)]
*  So when you look at his monument inside of DC, do you know this reverend is not on it? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=399.84s)]
*  No, I didn't know that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=406.23999999999995s)]
*  There are no, there's nothing about God on that monument. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=407.28s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=410.79999999999995s)]
*  This is not a mistake. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=412.56s)]
*  This is a confession. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=414.64s)]
*  They knew exactly who they were. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=416.55999999999995s)]
*  And our Bible tells us that a tree is known, how do you know a false prophet? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=419.2s)]
*  A tree is known by the fruit it bears. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=422.79999999999995s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=424.64s)]
*  You will not get good fruit from a bad tree or bad fruit from a good tree. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  Each tree and its fruit will be after its own kind. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=429.12s)]
*  So when you look at the black community and the condition that it's in, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=431.68s)]
*  if it's bad fruit, the tree had to be bad. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=434.64s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=437.12s)]
*  And if it's bad fruit, it's a false prophet. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=437.6s)]
*  It's binary. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=440.64s)]
*  And when you look at where we were between 1940 and 1960, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=442.0s)]
*  black community had cut its poverty rate from 80% to about 35% in 20 years, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=446.16s)]
*  the greatest reduction of poverty in the history of the world. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=451.76s)]
*  And then after the civil rights movement, we flatlined. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=458.08s)]
*  We turned from God to government. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=458.32s)]
*  And Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement led us on that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=461.67999999999995s)]
*  And we know how King was all tied up with the communists. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  Man, Stanley Levinson was the only communist in America. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=466.79999999999995s)]
*  Bayard Rustin had been a communist in his youth. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  The guy that ran the SELC, his name was Jack O'Dell, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=472.96s)]
*  Hunter Pitts O'Dell, he was a communist. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=475.52s)]
*  King's lawyer, Clarence Jones was a communist. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=478.4s)]
*  Clarence Jones and Stanley Levinson say, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=481.76s)]
*  they wrote the I Have a Dream speech. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=483.76s)]
*  They were both communists. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=485.92s)]
*  And when you look at the I Have a Dream speech, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=488.32s)]
*  it's amazing when you dissect it and deconstruct it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=490.88s)]
*  Because when King says five times in that speech, you know, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=494.0s)]
*  the first thing he said was, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=498.24s)]
*  a hundred years after the emancipation proclamation, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=500.0s)]
*  the Negro is still not free. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  That is a lie. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=504.24s)]
*  I was born free. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=506.0s)]
*  My freedom is a gift from God. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  It's an unalienable right. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=510.24s)]
*  According to John Locke and his second treaties of government, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=512.72s)]
*  it is irrevocable, non-transferable, and unsellable. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=515.28s)]
*  Now, King says five times in that speech that we were not free. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=518.8s)]
*  Then at the end, he has a great refrain that on some certain day, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=523.04s)]
*  we'll be free at last, free at last. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=525.68s)]
*  Thank God Almighty, we're free at last. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=528.0s)]
*  Still telling us we're not free. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=529.68s)]
*  And we make our children recite that speech [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=531.8399999999999s)]
*  every year on his birthday, saying that they're not free, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=535.04s)]
*  that they come to government for their unalienable right to freedom. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=537.76s)]
*  You don't ask government for your freedom. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=542.64s)]
*  You defy government to come and try to take it from you. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=544.4s)]
*  What did our founding fathers say [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=547.6s)]
*  when King George said, I'm your sovereign? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=551.68s)]
*  I'm going to show you. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  And he said, I'm not just going to come and kill you guys. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=555.36s)]
*  I'm going to bring you back to Great Britain. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=558.48s)]
*  I'm going to choke you till you're almost dead. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=560.64s)]
*  Then I'm going to castrate you. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=563.6s)]
*  Then I'm going to cut you open, let you see your guts before you die. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=565.68s)]
*  And then after you're dead, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=569.28s)]
*  I'm going to cut off your limbs and send them to the most parts of the British Empire. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=570.16s)]
*  And guess what the founding fathers said? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=573.12s)]
*  They did a declaration and said, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=575.68s)]
*  we pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=577.6s)]
*  Put their names on it, sent it to him and said, bring it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=581.44s)]
*  And whooped his ass. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=585.04s)]
*  Free men. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=587.84s)]
*  And then they walked around with their chest stuck out. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=589.44s)]
*  Yeah, we did it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=591.6s)]
*  And King just went around. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=593.44s)]
*  King would have asked King George, he said, well, boss, can we be free? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=594.72s)]
*  No. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=598.4s)]
*  Well, okay then. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=598.8s)]
*  We'll just march until you decide to give it to us. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=599.52s)]
*  Father, you don't give us our freedom. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=602.64s)]
*  We earn it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  It's ours. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=604.88s)]
*  Come and try to take it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=606.8s)]
*  And this is the mindset that they've placed into America, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=608.8s)]
*  Black America first, but now America. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=611.28s)]
*  And look at the results of it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=613.76s)]
*  We're at the bottom of every social economic statistic in America. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=615.68s)]
*  And there's a revolution now happening here in America. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=619.84s)]
*  They're turning against the Democratic Party. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=622.64s)]
*  They're turning away from it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=624.8s)]
*  They're turning away from it because they're seeing that it's not working. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=626.32s)]

*  And Black folks looking at him like, what? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=637.6s)]
*  You didn't see him at Morehouse College? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=642.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just the other day. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=644.72s)]
*  One of the funnest things I ever saw in my life. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=648.4000000000001s)]
*  He's a young Black man, 21, 22 years old. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=648.6400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=652.24s)]

*  These young boys ain't going to start about no mess like that. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=664.24s)]
*  They're in Morehouse. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  It's a Black college. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=670.24s)]
*  They've already segregated themselves. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=671.7600000000001s)]
*  They don't want to be around white people. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=675.44s)]
*  At Morehouse. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=678.48s)]
*  If they want to be around white folks, they don't want to Harvard and Yale or something. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=680.0s)]
*  You're at Morehouse, a Black all male college. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=683.76s)]
*  And you're going to talk to those brothers. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=689.68s)]
*  Nobody is for them brothers at the back of the bus unless they want to go at the back. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  It's interesting that you just said they segregated themselves. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=699.8399999999999s)]
*  They love Black culture. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=701.3599999999999s)]
*  It's not that they hate white people. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=703.52s)]
*  And that's what people try to say. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=706.16s)]
*  That if you love yourself, you hate somebody else. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=707.28s)]
*  No, it's not true. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=709.28s)]
*  I mean, good God. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  If a Jewish person goes to a Jewish school, don't mean he hates Gentiles. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=711.92s)]
*  We have to understand that loving yourself is a virtue. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  Jesus said, love your neighbor as you love yourself. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=720.64s)]
*  So the way you treat your neighbor is predicated on how you love yourself. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=724.3199999999999s)]
*  So if I don't love myself and I want to inject drugs in my arm, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=728.7199999999999s)]
*  I'll expect you to want to do the same. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=733.92s)]
*  And I'll allow you to do that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=736.16s)]
*  Because I love you as I love myself. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=738.24s)]
*  If I call myself the N-word, and of course I'm going to call you that [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=741.6800000000001s)]
*  because I'm loving you like I love myself. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=746.08s)]
*  But he says first, love God with all your heart, your soul, and your mind. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=750.24s)]
*  Then love your neighbor as you love yourself. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=755.84s)]
*  Those are the two commandments. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=758.96s)]
*  We leave the first one out. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=760.32s)]
*  See, if you get the first one first, you get the second one first. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=762.08s)]
*  We just tell people, love your neighbor as yourself. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=767.28s)]
*  And so many people hate themselves. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=770.8000000000001s)]
*  They also hate their neighbor. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's where the conflict comes in the black community. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=775.36s)]
*  Martin Luther King Jr. never talked about loving yourself. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=777.76s)]
*  He was always talking about trying to make some racist love you. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=780.48s)]
*  And you can't change how people view you. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  Our Bible tells us consistently, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=787.12s)]
*  do not be concerned about man and how he feels about you. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=788.64s)]
*  He will hate you. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=792.48s)]
*  He's going to hate you. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=793.36s)]
*  Don't be concerned about that. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=795.76s)]
*  You love him. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=797.28s)]
*  That doesn't give him license to put his hands on you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=797.92s)]
*  Christianity is not a religion of nonviolence. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=801.76s)]
*  It's a religion of non-aggression. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=804.7199999999999s)]
*  That means if you don't hurt, don't touch me, I won't touch you. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=808.0s)]
*  If you don't hurt my family, I won't touch you. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=811.04s)]
*  But if you come and you try to do harm to me or mine, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=814.24s)]
*  I'm going to whoop you up behind in the name of Jesus, get you off of me. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=819.68s)]
*  I have to take care of my family. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=824.0s)]
*  I have to take care of my family. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=825.76s)]
*  You know that if you let it be known, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=827.36s)]
*  anybody can come up in your house and eat your food [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=828.96s)]
*  and rape your wife and your daughters. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=831.28s)]
*  They're going to do it. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  There's no virtue in that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=834.48s)]
*  None. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=837.04s)]
*  And that's what King preached. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=838.3199999999999s)]
*  Allow these evil people to come into your home, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=840.3199999999999s)]
*  beat your wife, rape your children, blow up your house. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=845.68s)]
*  And that's why so many black men turned away from Christianity during that time. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=848.96s)]
*  They said, I'm not going to do that. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=851.6s)]
*  That's Christianity. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=852.4s)]
*  I'm not going to do it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  But they were teaching a false Christianity, a plantation Christianity from the slave master. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=854.48s)]
*  Jesus Christ went into the temple. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=859.4399999999999s)]
*  When he found those guys money changing, what did he do? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=860.9599999999999s)]
*  Made a whip, ran them out. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=864.24s)]
*  Nobody's touched him until he said, my time is gone. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=867.36s)]
*  He was not a pinata. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=871.04s)]
*  He didn't allow it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=872.24s)]
*  Who came up with the idea that you only vote in November in elections? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=872.9599999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=877.12s)]
*  You vote every single day with your time and your money. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=878.0s)]
*  You show your preferences. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=881.84s)]
*  You put your support behind things you believe in and you withhold support from things you don't. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=883.68s)]
*  You can do that with your cell phone, by the way. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=889.04s)]
*  There's a wireless company that if you're not on board with what's going on in this country [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=891.76s)]
*  at the highest levels, you can make your preference known. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=896.16s)]
*  It's called Pure Talk. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=899.12s)]
*  It's probably something you should consider. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=901.68s)]
*  It is proudly veteran led. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=903.8399999999999s)]
*  It is led by veterans of the U.S. military and it supports American jobs by [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=906.0s)]

*  All of them are right here in the United States. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=912.4s)]
*  What other company can say that, by the way? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=914.24s)]
*  Not many. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=916.08s)]
*  It proudly supports great charities, charities that you would support yourself like America's [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=916.88s)]
*  Warrior Partnership. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=921.04s)]
*  Every dollar you spend, some of that money goes to those charities every single month. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=922.72s)]
*  When you switch your cell phone service to Pure Talk, you know what? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=927.36s)]

*  With plans starting at just $20 a month for unlimited talk, taxed lots of data, you can [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=936.88s)]
*  literally cut your monthly cell phone bill in half while doing something that you can [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  feel good about and believe in. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=947.36s)]
*  The average family saves almost $1,000 a year. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=948.72s)]
*  So no contract, no cancellation fee, and a 30-day, a 30-day money back guarantee, it [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=951.84s)]

*  So I think your assessment of King is right. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=976.72s)]
*  I mean, of course. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=980.0s)]
*  The one thing about his life though that does make me pause is the speech that he gave the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=981.52s)]
*  night before he was shot in April of 68. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=987.68s)]
*  And he was a garbage strike, I think. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=990.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=993.04s)]
*  And in Memphis. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=993.78s)]
*  And he was late because he was in bed with a couple of different women. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=995.54s)]
*  And Ralph Abernathy finally bugged him until he showed up at the church. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=999.06s)]
*  No notes. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1002.42s)]
*  And gives this speech, which is not as well publicized as you think it would be, in which [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1003.62s)]
*  he basically predicts his death. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1008.18s)]
*  And I've listened to it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1010.9s)]
*  And again, I'm not a fan of Martin Luther King, but that's the most unbelievable speech [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1012.0999999999999s)]
*  I've ever heard in my life. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1017.06s)]
*  It is. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1017.9399999999999s)]
*  But King did that all the time. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1018.18s)]
*  But I guess my point is it's hard to see that and not think like God is speaking through [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1020.1800000000001s)]
*  him. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1025.94s)]
*  How can you predict your own death the night before? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1026.1000000000001s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1027.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think if you do it almost every day sooner or later when you die. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1029.7s)]
*  Oh, is that true? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1033.78s)]
*  Yeah, he always predicted it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1034.66s)]
*  He always said that this was going to happen to him. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1035.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know if he believed it or not. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1037.8600000000001s)]
*  I do know this. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1039.78s)]
*  That he had such a libertine lifestyle. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1041.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1044.74s)]
*  He was more like Rasputin than he was Jesus Christ. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1046.1200000000001s)]
*  He became an indispensable person in government for a very long time because they put so much [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1050.6s)]
*  behind him. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1056.6s)]
*  I read this great book. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1057.88s)]
*  I can't think of the name of it now. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1058.84s)]
*  They talked about that the Civil Rights Movement was more about the Cold War than it was about [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1059.96s)]
*  anything else. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1064.1200000000001s)]
*  Because the Russians were using the propaganda of how America treated black people to have [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1065.08s)]
*  African nations and Asian nations come to communism. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1070.44s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1072.84s)]
*  You're our comrades. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1073.4s)]
*  You're our brothers. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1074.3600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1075.0800000000002s)]
*  They had W.B. Du Bois come to China. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1075.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1077.72s)]
*  He gave him all kinds of awards and everything. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1077.88s)]
*  Stalin had these guys. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1079.48s)]
*  Malcolm X would go over there and talk. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1080.44s)]
*  So they were using it as a propaganda piece and they said, we have to take care of this. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1082.0400000000002s)]
*  So King was their front man in this effort. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1086.3600000000001s)]
*  They didn't know King was compromised by the communists until right before the March on [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1089.72s)]
*  Washington. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1093.16s)]
*  And that's when Bobby Kennedy, first, Deke Deloach told him, get these communists out. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1094.2800000000002s)]
*  Number two guy at the FPL. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1098.68s)]
*  Yeah, he wouldn't do it. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1099.64s)]
*  Then Bobby Kennedy told him, man, you got to get these guys out. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1101.0s)]
*  He wouldn't do it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1103.72s)]
*  And then right before the March on Washington, the big seven, big six, whatever came to the [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1105.32s)]
*  White House and Bobby kind of gave John Kennedy a nod and John Kennedy told King, come out [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1110.04s)]
*  to the Rose Garden. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1114.92s)]
*  I want to talk to you. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1115.64s)]
*  He didn't even want it to be bugged in the Oval Office because he was going to share [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1116.68s)]
*  top secret information with it. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1119.24s)]
*  And he said, I know you know you're under surveillance. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1121.08s)]
*  That's the only way you talk for saying you're under surveillance. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1123.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1126.6s)]
*  You have three, four guys in your organization are communist. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1127.0s)]
*  They got to go. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1131.1599999999999s)]
*  And he called their names. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1132.6799999999998s)]
*  They're Rustin, Jack O'Dell, Stanley Levinson. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1133.6399999999999s)]
*  He said, these guys are communists and they have to go. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1138.4399999999998s)]
*  And the King tried to deny it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1140.6s)]
*  He said, look, do you think I pulled these guys names out of a hat? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1141.56s)]
*  I'm the president of the United States of America and I know their name. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1144.12s)]
*  And he bought up this guy in Great Britain that they call him some type of sex scandal. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1147.1599999999999s)]
*  But get his name. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1152.6s)]
*  But he said, you know about this? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1153.3999999999999s)]
*  He said, yes. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1155.1599999999999s)]
*  He said, well, he lost his government behind that. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1155.64s)]
*  He said, I could do the same thing. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1157.96s)]
*  If you go down, I go down. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1159.16s)]
*  You got to get rid of these guys because I'm affiliated with you. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1161.0800000000002s)]
*  They invested a lot in him. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1165.5600000000002s)]
*  So King said he would do it. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1167.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, J. Edgar Hoover, of course, didn't believe it. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1169.4s)]
*  And he heard about this group of communists that were going to be meeting down in Dorchester, Georgia. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1171.4s)]
*  And he set up some cameras to see who was going to show up. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1176.68s)]
*  And lo and behold, Martin Luther King Jr. showed up in this master spies. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1179.4s)]
*  After this long conversation with the president, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1183.48s)]
*  and he bought these pictures back to Bobby Kennedy and said, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1186.1200000000001s)]
*  I thought he said he's going to get rid of these guys. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1189.0800000000002s)]
*  He's going to cut them loose. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1190.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's when Bobby Kennedy signed to put the wiretaps on him. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1192.68s)]
*  He said because, and it was more to protect him [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1195.4s)]
*  because they thought he was going to be blackmailed and that he was going to be infiltrated. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1200.1200000000001s)]
*  And so they watched him. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1206.44s)]
*  And as you notice, none of this stuff really got out until, it is funny how it got out. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1207.5600000000002s)]
*  The night of the Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali fight in 1971, everybody's watching this fight, right? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1212.6799999999998s)]
*  So this group of weirdo communists decided that they were going to [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1220.04s)]
*  burglarize the FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1227.2399999999998s)]
*  They burglarized the FBI office and guess what they found? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1231.7199999999998s)]
*  The COINTELPRO papers. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1233.9599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1235.3999999999999s)]
*  Bought them out and gave them to the Washington Post, to the New York Times. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1236.1999999999998s)]
*  And that's where all the stuff about King came out. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1239.08s)]
*  It wasn't J. Edgar Hoover, it wasn't the FBI, it wasn't the conservative. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1242.04s)]
*  It was the liberals that put it out there. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1244.84s)]
*  And when people started reading it, they said, oh my God, Hoover had kept King's stuff secret. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1246.92s)]
*  All of it. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1255.56s)]
*  Nobody knew it. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1256.52s)]
*  The sex stuff. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1258.04s)]
*  Yeah, the sex stuff. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1258.76s)]
*  And then when it got out, the people, King's people wanted to have it all destroyed. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1260.04s)]
*  And that's when the judge said, no, we're going to take it and we're going to seal it. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1266.76s)]
*  For 50 years. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1271.32s)]
*  And nobody can see it. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1273.8s)]
*  But yeah, these liberal morons were the ones that broke into the FBI office and stole it [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1275.24s)]
*  and gave it to the press. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1281.72s)]
*  And that's how we knew about King's affairs and his 45 girlfriends and his prostitutes [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1283.08s)]
*  and the orgies, which the thing that bothers me more about all of it, Tucker, is the prostitutes. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1289.32s)]
*  The orgies are bad. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1295.88s)]
*  We ain't got to talk about that. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1297.48s)]
*  But when you buy flesh and you say you're a man of God, that's very visceral with me. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1299.0s)]
*  That's visceral. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1309.0s)]
*  Just so much terrible stuff. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1312.92s)]
*  But the fact that they say he plagiarized his PhD, which means that he was a fake doctor. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1314.44s)]
*  And then they say that he wasn't a Christian. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1321.72s)]
*  It means he was a fake Christian. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1325.16s)]
*  And he walks around with these communists. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1327.32s)]
*  And it had gotten so bad that Dick DeLose finally told J. Edgar Hoover, he said, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1329.9599999999998s)]
*  you can't talk to him. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1339.56s)]
*  And that's when J. Edgar Hoover then decided to make him an enemy of the state. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1341.08s)]
*  And this is when it gets interesting with his assassination. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1344.9199999999998s)]
*  When I read this in Taylor Branch's book, Parting the Waters, American King Years, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1347.8s)]
*  and Taylor Branch is a Democrat. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1353.9599999999998s)]
*  He's Bill Clinton's roommate at Yale. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1355.8799999999999s)]
*  So it's not a conservative saying this. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1358.9199999999998s)]
*  It's a Democrat Bill Clinton friend that said this about King. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1361.1599999999999s)]
*  He said that the FBI designated King an enemy of the state. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1364.28s)]
*  And it's only about five or six people that had such a designation in United States America history. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1369.24s)]
*  And they said that with this designation, even if they heard that somebody was coming to assassinate [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1374.6799999999998s)]
*  him, they wouldn't warn him. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1380.28s)]
*  And that was a courtesy they would give to mafia dons. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1382.52s)]
*  They would not give it to King. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1386.92s)]
*  So they said he's the enemy of the United States of America. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1389.32s)]
*  This is interesting that he was so affiliated with these people. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1392.6000000000001s)]
*  They found out that money from Moscow was bankrolling the civil rights movement. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1396.68s)]
*  He was getting money from Moscow put in his pocket. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1400.68s)]
*  All of this. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1403.0800000000002s)]
*  That he was deemed the enemy of the United States of America by the federal government. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1404.68s)]
*  And so I'm reading this. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1411.16s)]
*  And I'm reading this stuff about right now, FBI and the government hated Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1414.1200000000001s)]
*  Hated the civil rights movement, da da da da. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1419.24s)]
*  But I read this story about this group called the Revolutionary Action Movement, RAM. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1421.4s)]
*  Maxwell Stanford was running it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1427.64s)]
*  Took two part. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1429.64s)]
*  Shakur's people were involved in all of this. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1431.56s)]
*  And these guys are rough. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1434.04s)]
*  They had decided that they were going to assassinate [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1435.96s)]
*  Whitney Young for the Urban League and Roy Wilkins for the NAACP. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1439.24s)]
*  They were going to take out the black leadership because they thought they were Uncle Tom's. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1442.76s)]
*  And Hoover had infiltrated RAM and knew what they were doing. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1446.6s)]
*  If J. Edgar Hoover had hated the civil rights movement, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1453.4s)]
*  he would have allowed RAM to go ahead and do what they were going to do. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1456.44s)]
*  And then would have arrested them and said, look at this, black people killing black people. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1458.92s)]
*  Ain't this a shame? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1461.56s)]
*  Instead, what does he do? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1463.4s)]
*  He warns the people in the civil rights movement, protects them. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1464.76s)]
*  Then he arrests the guys at RAM and destroys the whole organization. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1468.04s)]
*  They go into exile. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1471.5600000000002s)]
*  Some go to Cuba. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1472.68s)]
*  They all run off. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1473.48s)]
*  Others, he put in jail. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1474.3600000000001s)]
*  Does that sound like a man that hates the civil rights movement? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1475.96s)]
*  No. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1479.0800000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1479.24s)]
*  Juan Williams did a book on Thurgood Marshall. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1480.8400000000001s)]
*  As you know, Thurgood Marshall was a federal judge. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1485.0800000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1487.3200000000002s)]
*  For a long time, then became Supreme Court Justice, Solicitor General. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1487.8s)]
*  Thurgood Marshall said, J. Edgar Hoover never lied to him. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1490.8400000000001s)]
*  He had to sign the warrants as a federal judge. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1493.64s)]
*  He said, Hoover didn't have to lie. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1496.84s)]
*  He said, Hoover always had the goods. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1498.52s)]
*  Never lied to him. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1501.56s)]
*  So why this assassination on the character of J. Edgar Hoover? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1502.92s)]
*  Because he took out communists. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1507.08s)]
*  He took out Marxists. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1508.52s)]
*  He took out these malcontents that hate America. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1510.04s)]
*  You know, the same group in 1968 to try to take over the Democratic Party in Chicago, right? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1514.2s)]
*  And Mayor Daley and the hardhats ran them out. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1518.6s)]
*  And they were out there screaming, the whole world is watching. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1521.32s)]
*  The whole world is watching. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1523.32s)]
*  What does Saul Lansky tell them? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1524.6s)]
*  You got three choices. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1526.2s)]
*  Either find a wailing wall and cry. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1527.8s)]
*  Start making bombs and exploding everything. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1530.76s)]
*  And then they're going to turn to GOP. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1533.64s)]
*  Or go organize. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1535.08s)]
*  And in four months come back, four years come back and you be the delegates. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1536.92s)]
*  They came back to Miami in 1972. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1541.88s)]
*  They were so well-versed in the rules of the Democratic Party [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1544.76s)]
*  that when Daley showed up with his Illinois Chicago attention, they ran him out. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1550.92s)]
*  And Jesse Jackson and this guy by the name of Singer took their place. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1557.0s)]
*  They took over the Democratic Party in 1972. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1561.32s)]
*  And they bought an LGBTQ and abortion and that stuff for the first time. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1564.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's when Richard Nixon slaughtered them. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1567.64s)]
*  Remember? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1569.16s)]
*  Nixon didn't eat Watergate. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1569.8s)]
*  The Democrats imploded in 1972. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1571.56s)]
*  And they did it from the Civil Rights Movement. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1575.64s)]
*  All of those people from the Civil Rights Movement. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1577.64s)]
*  That was their plan. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1579.48s)]
*  To come in and take the Democratic Party. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1580.2s)]
*  They tried it in 68. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1582.1200000000001s)]
*  Daley beat them down. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1583.8s)]
*  They then used the rules. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1585.08s)]
*  72 they got it. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1586.52s)]
*  They haven't let it go since. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1587.56s)]
*  And they finally, finally got what they wanted in 2008 with Barack Obama. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1588.92s)]
*  Who is Obama in retrospect? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1593.32s)]
*  I think Obama was a part of a worldwide liberal movement. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1595.48s)]
*  From Western Europe to here. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1601.56s)]
*  All of them, all of these cabal of weirdos over there in Europe [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1603.64s)]
*  that were pushing things at that time. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1606.28s)]
*  From Merkel to the guy over in France. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1607.88s)]
*  Obama was involved in all of it. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1611.8000000000002s)]
*  And all this LGBTQ stuff and all this climate change crap started happening then. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1613.16s)]
*  And it's all designed for a one world government to try to get, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1617.96s)]
*  I don't know, the World Health Organization or the UN or somebody [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1621.8000000000002s)]
*  to start getting some type of criminal court [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1624.92s)]
*  that can start arresting us for not doing what they want us to do. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1627.0800000000002s)]
*  It's funny the distance between what you thought something was [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1630.92s)]
*  and then what you later learn out of that. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1635.3200000000002s)]
*  It actually was. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1637.24s)]
*  And on the LGBTQ plus or whatever calling it now, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1638.8400000000001s)]
*  I was raised in a pretty liberal area where we were told that was about, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1645.0s)]
*  you know, a certain percent of the population, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1649.0s)]
*  I think it was 10% they said was gay by birth. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1650.8400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, leave them alone. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1653.96s)]
*  Don't bother them. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1655.64s)]
*  Don't be mean to them. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1656.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1657.24s)]
*  And that always made sense to me. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1657.72s)]
*  I had zero interest in bothering people in general, particularly over their sex life. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1659.96s)]
*  But now I'm starting to think in my age that it wasn't that actually wasn't kind of what it was about. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1664.4399999999998s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1669.6399999999999s)]
*  It's it's a it's it's they understand what they're doing. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1670.28s)]
*  You know what communism is. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1676.6s)]
*  Number one is atheism. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1678.1999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1680.12s)]
*  Because they do not compete for power. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1680.6s)]
*  Number one, it's atheism. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1682.28s)]
*  I agree with number one, they don't compete for power. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1683.8799999999999s)]
*  In America, we say there's a higher law than the Constitution. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1687.6399999999999s)]
*  It's God. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1691.0s)]
*  It's God. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1691.96s)]
*  There are certain rights that we have that you cannot touch, government. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1692.92s)]
*  That's our whole concept of government. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1696.8400000000001s)]
*  Unalienable rights. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1699.0s)]
*  We have a bill of rights that say you can't touch these, government. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1700.44s)]
*  The communists say no, no such ideology exists. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1704.3600000000001s)]
*  The government controls all. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1708.2s)]
*  So God has to be destroyed. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1710.6000000000001s)]
*  We know that much of LGBTQ is in direct conflict with our Bible. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1713.16s)]
*  Direct conflict. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1718.1200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1719.96s)]
*  So it's like the Daniel test. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1721.88s)]
*  They had Daniel, you know, you know the story. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1725.24s)]
*  Daniel was was was the king's favorite and the and the guys in Babylon started getting [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1727.0s)]
*  jealous of Daniel and they said, we're going to set him up. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1732.68s)]
*  So they say, hey, King, why don't you make a decree that says that no one can pray to you [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1735.3200000000002s)]
*  for 30 days? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1742.92s)]
*  He said, yeah, it makes sense. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1744.7600000000002s)]
*  But they knew that Daniel prayed four or five times a day to his God and say they so [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1746.3600000000001s)]
*  they say so if the king makes this decree. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1751.32s)]
*  If Daniel obeys the decree, his God leaves him. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1754.28s)]
*  If he disobeys the king, the king will kill him. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1759.08s)]
*  Either way, Daniel's in the trick bag. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1762.04s)]
*  So of course, the king makes the decree. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1764.36s)]
*  They're spying on Daniel, sees him praying to his God. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1766.2s)]
*  You know the rest of the story. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1768.6799999999998s)]
*  They put him into the lion's den. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1769.56s)]
*  God saves him. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1770.84s)]
*  King kills those guys. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1771.8s)]
*  It's the same thing in America now. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1773.08s)]
*  We're going to pass laws to you Christians. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1774.52s)]
*  You're going to bow to us. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1778.4399999999998s)]
*  If you do what your God says, we're going to punish you. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1781.3999999999999s)]
*  But if you do what we say, your God is going to leave you. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1786.04s)]
*  Either way, we're in the trick bag. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1789.56s)]
*  Either way, they have us. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1791.8s)]
*  This is not what we were promised. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1793.0s)]
*  We were promised a society where everyone kind of does his own thing and everyone gets along. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1794.4399999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1799.6399999999999s)]
*  Treat other people with respect. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1800.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1801.3999999999999s)]
*  Some measure of dignity. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1801.96s)]
*  You don't have to agree with them. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1803.0s)]
*  They don't have to follow your religion, but you also don't have to follow their religion. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1804.52s)]

*  The bandleader wouldn't let him out. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1856.36s)]
*  He asked my father if he could handle it. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1858.36s)]
*  My father said yes. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1859.6399999999999s)]
*  Father goes to the bandleader, offers him $10,000 to let Johnny go. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1861.0s)]
*  Bandleader says no. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1864.1999999999998s)]

*  And he gets Johnny out of the contract with a certified check of $1,000. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1869.88s)]
*  Kay says, Michael, how did he do that? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1875.32s)]
*  He said, well, Luca Rosi would have gone to the bandleader's head and promised him [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1877.32s)]
*  that either his brains or his citizenship would be on the contract. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1880.52s)]
*  Michael, that's a true story. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1883.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1885.32s)]
*  Question, was Vito Corleone a violent man for using Luca Rosi? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1886.04s)]
*  Of course he was. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1890.28s)]
*  Martin Luther King Jr. wants to eat a hamburger down south. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1892.04s)]
*  Racist white man says no. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1895.88s)]
*  Martin says, I'll be back. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1898.76s)]

*  He used violence from a third party. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1914.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1916.6s)]
*  Civil rights movement wasn't a nonviolent movement. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1917.48s)]
*  A nonviolent movement would have been changing your neighbor's heart [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1920.44s)]
*  by your actions. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1924.28s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1926.28s)]
*  If he's mean to me, I'm good to him. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1927.72s)]

*  And this is how you get your respect. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1949.08s)]
*  Instead, what did they do? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1951.56s)]
*  They used the gun. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1953.48s)]
*  In the book of Corinthians, it says 11 people will not enter the kingdom of heaven. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1954.84s)]
*  The last one is the extortionist. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1958.92s)]
*  What's the extortionist? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1961.0s)]
*  An extortionist is the one that uses violence, threats, coercion to get what they want. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1962.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's what the civil rights movement did. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1970.6s)]
*  It didn't change the hearts of Americans. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1972.68s)]
*  It extorted them. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1974.68s)]
*  It told them either give us what we want or we're going to blow your brains out, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1976.1200000000001s)]
*  we're going to put you in jail. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1979.96s)]
*  That is not the Christian way. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1981.32s)]
*  And it failed because they used the tool of the devil to get what they wanted. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1983.16s)]
*  And it continues to fail. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1987.0s)]
*  We all are at the bottom of every socioeconomic statistic in America [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1989.24s)]
*  because we will not do what we're always supposed to have done. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1992.76s)]
*  And that was living this meritocracy. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1996.6s)]
*  How do we break into the NFL? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=1998.2s)]

*  And they put the black preacher up ahead of it all the time. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2124.76s)]
*  And if any black person like when Byron Donald just said that the black family [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2128.0400000000004s)]
*  is more intact during Jim Crow. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2131.96s)]
*  Oh, they came up. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2135.0s)]
*  Byron Donald said black people were doing better during Jim Crow. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2135.8s)]
*  He didn't say that. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2139.0800000000004s)]
*  He said, despite of Jim Crow, Jim Crow couldn't destroy us. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2140.28s)]
*  But the iron triangle, the black preacher, the black politician, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2145.0s)]
*  the black civil rights work, they will. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2147.8s)]
*  They have. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2150.44s)]
*  Slavery didn't kill us. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2151.88s)]
*  Jim Crow didn't kill us. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2153.32s)]
*  But the Democratic Party, they are taking us out. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2154.44s)]
*  They are destroying the black community right now. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2157.8s)]
*  You may have come to the obvious conclusion that the real debate is not between Republican [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2159.88s)]
*  and Democrat or socialist and capitalist right left. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2163.8s)]
*  The real battles between people who are lying on purpose [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2169.08s)]
*  and people who are trying to tell you the truth. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2172.44s)]
*  It's between good and evil. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2175.2400000000002s)]
*  It's between honesty and falsehood. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2176.76s)]
*  And we hope we are on the former side. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2179.64s)]

*  So you grew up, you're a couple years older than I am. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2202.28s)]
*  You grew up in far western Tennessee near Mississippi and Arkansas. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2204.84s)]
*  I think in one of the two majority black counties in Tennessee. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2211.4s)]
*  And you entered school right around the time DSEG started to roll. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2216.36s)]
*  So you've actually lived this and seen it. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2222.52s)]
*  Tell us about the change that you've seen. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2225.08s)]
*  I've seen black people lose their virtue. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2228.44s)]
*  Even though they were poor, they were approaching with society. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2231.1600000000003s)]
*  Nobody went to jail. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2234.12s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2235.4s)]
*  In your world that you lived in? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2237.0s)]
*  Yeah, nobody. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2238.12s)]
*  Families stayed intact. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2239.2400000000002s)]
*  People stayed married. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2241.0s)]
*  Nobody got divorced. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2241.88s)]
*  Didn't happen. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2244.0400000000004s)]
*  If a child was born and the parents weren't married, the grandparents took care of that child. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2245.7200000000003s)]
*  It wasn't a single parent environment. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2251.6400000000003s)]
*  He was staying with his grandparents. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2254.92s)]
*  He had a mother and a father. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2256.0400000000004s)]
*  He was taken care of or she was taken care of. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2257.32s)]
*  The people had a sort of majesty about them. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2260.76s)]
*  They went to church. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2264.0400000000004s)]
*  They were honest. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2264.92s)]
*  Never saw a police officer hardly. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2266.76s)]
*  A sheriff's department. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2268.1200000000003s)]
*  People just got along. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2269.08s)]
*  And now it's changed. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2271.88s)]
*  The hip hop culture got involved in it. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2275.72s)]
*  At the beginning of the hip hop culture, they tried to warn people about it. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2278.6s)]
*  I remember when I think it was Tip O'Gore and some other lady tried to warn people about it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2284.36s)]
*  In the 80s. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2291.3199999999997s)]
*  In the 80s. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2292.04s)]
*  The NAACP, C. Lewis Tucker got involved. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2294.68s)]
*  Warn people about it. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2298.92s)]
*  Then all of a sudden, from what Shug Knight said, they started paying them and they all shut up. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2301.56s)]
*  They started giving them money. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2307.8s)]
*  Now the NAACP gives awards to them. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2309.08s)]
*  Now all the urban leagues, they give these guys awards. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2312.76s)]
*  The hip hop culture is a culture of sex, violence, and materialism. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2316.52s)]
*  No virtue whatsoever. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2320.44s)]
*  How many jugglers you shot? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2322.44s)]
*  How many women you slept with? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2323.96s)]
*  How much money you got? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2325.88s)]
*  Violence, sexual gratification, virtualists. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2329.2400000000002s)]
*  And Thomas Wolfe said, the great writer Thomas Wolfe said that culture is the arts elevated to [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2336.36s)]
*  a set of beliefs. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2341.88s)]
*  So you have the arts, you have the culture, and you have the politics. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2343.88s)]
*  In your arts, you have religion, you have music, you have books, you have television, radio. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2348.36s)]
*  Those are the arts. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2353.0s)]
*  We allowed a satanic movement to take over the arts of the black community, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2354.76s)]
*  and that spread into the white community. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2359.6400000000003s)]
*  That was the hip hop culture. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2361.4s)]
*  You went out listening to The Temptations and listening to all this great music growing up, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2364.04s)]
*  and write stacks. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2370.84s)]
*  These people, I want to kill an N word, I want to F an N word. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2371.96s)]
*  This little rapper in Memphis by the name of Glo-rella, not Go-rella, Glo-rella. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2376.92s)]
*  Just wasn't invited to the White House. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2382.76s)]
*  Her hit record at the time was I F N words for free. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2385.1600000000003s)]
*  Gets a White House invitation. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2390.92s)]
*  Barack Obama had all of them at the White House at one time. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2393.2400000000002s)]
*  He had a little hip hop festival in the Oval Office. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2395.6400000000003s)]
*  He had Rick Ross and Dr. Dre, Snoop, all of them. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2399.4s)]
*  All I'm talking about killing. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2405.0800000000004s)]
*  You see how a young society that wants to understand what right is. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2406.68s)]
*  Our time, you had astronauts and Nobel laureates brought to the White House. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2413.8s)]
*  You say, that's what I want to aspire to be. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2417.64s)]
*  Those people you brought to the White House are the people you aspire to be. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2420.04s)]
*  The heavyweight champion of the world, the Super Bowl champs. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2422.92s)]
*  Those are the people you aspire to be. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2425.88s)]
*  Now they bring these people and say, you should aspire to be that. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2427.8s)]
*  Then they're alarmed when they are that. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2431.96s)]
*  Well, you had Snoop at the White House. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2434.52s)]
*  Snoop talking about smoking blunts every day. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2436.36s)]
*  And he's on TV selling more merchandise than Morgan Freeman is right now. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2439.88s)]
*  What is Snoop selling? Cars? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2444.36s)]
*  He's selling beer and he's selling sneakers. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2446.04s)]
*  And he a dope fiend. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2449.1600000000003s)]
*  Talked about killing folks. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2451.4s)]
*  Talk about robbing people. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2452.6s)]
*  But they made him a hero. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2454.6s)]
*  And people look at this and they say, well, why are these things happening? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2457.96s)]
*  That's why these things are happening. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2460.76s)]
*  Because you hold these people up as heroes in our society. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2462.04s)]
*  Violent, evil, sadistic individuals. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2466.6800000000003s)]
*  And when your children act like them, you're alarmed. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2469.96s)]
*  Women walking around half naked talking about having sex with people. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2472.84s)]
*  Then when they do and they're shaking like, oh, what's going on? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2475.6400000000003s)]
*  And you just kind of look at them and say, yeah. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2478.92s)]
*  So you're wondering why middle class white Americans treat you this way. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2480.76s)]
*  I'm afraid of snakes because every time I looked on TV, a snake was killing somebody. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2485.4s)]
*  So I don't like them. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2489.08s)]
*  If you want to see me run out of here, let the snake come through that door right now. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2490.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, I'm leaving. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2492.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2493.8s)]
*  You have a hip hop culture that put all on television. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2494.12s)]
*  Black men shooting people, black men raping people, black men doing dope, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2498.52s)]
*  black men kicking in doors and spraying the whole freaking room shaking gun. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2503.48s)]
*  And then when they see the black man that looks like that come near them [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2506.92s)]
*  and they kind of get apprehensive, well, you a racist? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2512.04s)]
*  No, I'm sane. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2515.0s)]
*  You look like the person on TV that does these things. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2517.96s)]
*  If I saw a white man walk to me with a swastika in the middle of his head, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2522.76s)]
*  I don't look at him and think he's going to be a friend of mine. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2526.2000000000003s)]
*  And he walks up to me, hey man, why are you tripping? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2531.0s)]
*  Man, you got a swastika in the middle of your head. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2532.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm tripping. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2535.6400000000003s)]

*  If you see a house on fire and there's a fireman over there with a farmer, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2543.6400000000003s)]

*  No, I'm just wearing this uniform. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2556.04s)]
*  I'm not really a police officer. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2556.84s)]
*  Well, you see a young man looking like a thug [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2558.28s)]
*  and you treat him like a thug. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2561.96s)]

*  Why would an intelligent woman want to be looked upon as a whore? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2578.28s)]
*  Why are you dressing like one? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2581.4s)]
*  And these children look confused. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2583.88s)]
*  You know why? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2585.6400000000003s)]
*  Because no one is telling them what right is any longer. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2586.2000000000003s)]
*  In the military, it was this thing that every, you knew what right was. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2590.76s)]
*  Shoes shine, creases sit down, down, down, down, down, down the seams, standing straight. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2593.96s)]
*  It was written down. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2599.6400000000003s)]
*  This is what right is. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2600.6000000000004s)]
*  When I grew up, when you grew up, your father, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2602.76s)]
*  make your bed up in the morning time, always tell the truth. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2604.92s)]
*  You will have children going up now with the parents [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2608.04s)]
*  of teaching them to steal, teaching them to lie, teaching them how to get over. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2609.8s)]
*  I learned that when I worked in prison for five years, these guys were antisocial. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2615.64s)]
*  They had been taught a completely different values than I had. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2620.44s)]
*  And it was almost like what Myra was talking about when we talk about reeducation camps, right? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2626.92s)]
*  You say, oh, man, it's got to be a cultural reformation. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2631.48s)]
*  But that's what they've done to America now. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2633.64s)]
*  People will actually sit down and argue with you about whether or not gay sex is right between two [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2635.72s)]
*  men. And you, and I grew up and say, no fornication is right outside of marriage. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2643.08s)]
*  And if you screw up, what do you do? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2648.2s)]
*  You ask, you repent and God forgive you. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2649.24s)]
*  But instead of you trying to tell me that the Christian faith allows for fornication [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2651.72s)]
*  outside of marriage or gay sex, you're a liar. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2656.9199999999996s)]
*  And why would you tell a child that? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2660.2s)]
*  Why would you take away the ability for him to repent? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2662.3599999999997s)]
*  See, that's what pride is, isn't it? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2666.92s)]
*  What did St. Louis say the most damnable sin was? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2668.52s)]
*  Pride. There's a few things in the Bible that God hates and one thing, it's pride. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2671.16s)]
*  God hates pride. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2676.68s)]
*  It's one of the seven deadly sins. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2678.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2679.96s)]
*  What do they call them? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2680.52s)]

*  Pride. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2683.0s)]
*  Pride. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2685.0s)]
*  I'm going to make you do what I want you to do. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2686.12s)]
*  All about me. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2690.84s)]
*  My truth. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2692.2s)]
*  I want to be seen. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2693.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, you and I as men said, why the Bible tells us, don't worry about how man views you. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2694.92s)]
*  But they said, I demand to be seen. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2700.92s)]
*  I demand that you treat me the way that I want to be treated. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2703.08s)]
*  Pride. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2706.2s)]
*  Pride. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2707.7200000000003s)]
*  And what does pride say? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2708.68s)]
*  If you come up and tell them you're doing something wrong, I'm not. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2709.96s)]
*  And therefore I'm not going to ask for repentance. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2713.4s)]
*  I'm not going to ask for reconciliation. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2715.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not wrong. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2718.04s)]
*  Honey, even if you are wrong, he'll forgive you. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2720.12s)]
*  There's no injury in asking for forgiveness. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2723.08s)]
*  I'm not going to do it. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2725.2400000000002s)]
*  Wow, that's terrible because that's what our whole religion is built upon. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2728.84s)]
*  Us being very flawed. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2735.4s)]
*  Jesus knowing that we're flawed. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2739.88s)]
*  But recognizing the flaw and reconciling. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2742.68s)]
*  It's just that simple. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2746.2s)]
*  And pride tells them, don't you dare. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2747.2400000000002s)]
*  Don't you dare say that you're wrong. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2750.2s)]
*  Don't you dare say you need any type of reconciliation or repentance or forgiveness. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2751.8s)]
*  Don't you dare. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2756.04s)]
*  And these children are buying into it. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2757.8s)]
*  And it's just wrong. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2760.2s)]
*  What's the effect of a boy growing up in a female-led household? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2762.84s)]
*  And then, you know, multiply that by millions and you have, you know, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2769.4s)]
*  over 70% of boys growing up in the black community. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2774.44s)]
*  But now also among whites in a female-led household, like that's a huge change. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2777.96s)]
*  And what does it produce? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2786.12s)]
*  The discipline and the protection of the father is necessary. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2789.8s)]
*  Sometimes women will just want their father to be a breadwinner. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2794.12s)]
*  No, that's third or fourth down the line. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2796.92s)]
*  He still loves his family before he even provides for them. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2801.32s)]
*  He's protecting them before he loves them and protects them first. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2804.2s)]
*  Provides discipline, spiritual counseling, providing sustenance is down the line [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2807.56s)]
*  because without those first four, whatever he provides, it's no good. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2815.72s)]
*  So they've taken away his protection. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2820.36s)]
*  In many ways, some women do it well, but very few. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2822.84s)]
*  Women have a difficulty being as stern with their sons as men do [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2827.24s)]
*  because it's just something about two males being in a house, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2832.36s)]
*  especially when they start growing up. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2835.4s)]
*  And the father knowing what's out there waiting for his son, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2837.0s)]
*  that other men will kill him, that other men will take full advantage of him [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2840.6s)]
*  in a way that a woman does not understand. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2845.2400000000002s)]
*  That's true. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2847.48s)]
*  A father knows this. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2848.44s)]
*  There are things that happen to you and I talk, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2850.6s)]
*  we have never ever talked to our wives about. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2852.04s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2854.04s)]
*  You know, our daughters about. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2854.92s)]
*  But you'll pull your son over and say, listen, you need to watch this. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2856.6800000000003s)]
*  They can give you nuances. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2860.6s)]
*  They can tell you how to walk. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2862.04s)]
*  They can tell you how to talk. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2863.96s)]
*  Put some bass in your voice. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2864.84s)]
*  Put a grip behind that handshake. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2866.52s)]
*  Look him in the eye. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2868.6s)]
*  Fathers teach their sons that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2871.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm going to take you to get your first job. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2873.56s)]
*  You show up early. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2875.7200000000003s)]
*  You leave late. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2877.32s)]
*  You don't steal. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2878.44s)]
*  You don't lie. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2879.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you understand me? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2880.44s)]
*  Do you have to deal with me? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2881.32s)]
*  He teaches them in the morning time. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2882.44s)]
*  Make your bed. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2883.8s)]
*  Do your chores. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2884.84s)]
*  If not, it's going to be hell to pay. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2885.8s)]
*  It's rote. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2887.2400000000002s)]
*  It's binary all the time. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2888.04s)]
*  As he gets older, the gray areas can come in and he protects him. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2890.12s)]
*  So a lot of black women now like to have a lot of gay men around their children. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2893.0s)]
*  Father wouldn't have had it. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2897.48s)]
*  And then what happens, a lot of these young men are being molested at an early age [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2899.0s)]
*  and their first sexual experience becomes their lifestyle. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2902.76s)]
*  And now there is a category of HIV from 12 to 17 years old. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2906.6s)]
*  Who's giving these children AIDS? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2912.12s)]
*  Who's giving them HIV? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2913.56s)]
*  So this whole protection thing, this instinct that men have when it comes down to their boys, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2916.92s)]
*  my father would tell my mother, look, you stay out of this. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2922.52s)]
*  That's things that have to happen between me and Vince that you don't need to see. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2925.64s)]
*  Because he knew my mother couldn't handle it. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2929.24s)]
*  He would tell you, I don't care how hot it is, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2931.24s)]
*  y'all need to be moled today and I'll be back at five o'clock. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2933.72s)]
*  It needs to be done. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2935.88s)]
*  If it wasn't done, it was going to be hell to pay. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2936.52s)]
*  And it wasn't emotional. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2939.4s)]
*  It was rote. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2940.6s)]
*  You, we had an agreement. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2942.3599999999997s)]
*  You didn't do it. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2943.7999999999997s)]
*  This is where the discipline in my family, me and my brothers come from. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2944.68s)]
*  It came from dad. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2948.04s)]
*  And now dad is the most affable old gentleman you can meet. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2949.8s)]
*  But he understood that at that time he was raising boys to be men. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2952.84s)]
*  And that he had to teach us in our faith. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2958.04s)]
*  On Sunday, you went to church. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2959.7200000000003s)]
*  You did your chores. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2962.76s)]
*  You respected your parents. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2964.36s)]
*  You respected adults. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2966.1200000000003s)]
*  You respected authority. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2967.56s)]
*  And he would always tell us, the name you got is my name. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2969.6400000000003s)]
*  It's not yours. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2974.28s)]
*  It's mine. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2977.0s)]
*  And it reflects on me. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2978.2799999999997s)]
*  So don't go out there and mess up my name. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2981.16s)]
*  And he was serious about that. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2983.72s)]
*  And we took it to heart. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2986.2s)]
*  See, you don't, we don't have a man in the house to tell a son that [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2988.2799999999997s)]
*  and look him in his eye and let him understand, you know, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2991.4s)]
*  because sometimes a boy can be 15, 16 years old. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2993.3199999999997s)]
*  He's as big as I am. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2995.48s)]
*  I was a 120, 30 pound mother going to handle him. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=2997.08s)]
*  They can't. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3000.2s)]
*  How did the boys in your family do? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3000.8399999999997s)]
*  Everybody did well. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3002.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3003.7999999999997s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3004.3599999999997s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3005.0s)]
*  I had a brother that died young. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3005.72s)]
*  He died at 39 years old. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3007.08s)]
*  So everyone else has done fantastically well. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3009.16s)]
*  You know, our family story is an American story [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3014.4399999999996s)]
*  because we believe in this country. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3019.8799999999997s)]
*  We don't walk around talking about racism and white folks and the government. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3021.48s)]
*  Whenever there's a problem, we look at ourselves and say, what did we do wrong? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3027.0s)]
*  It's empowering to be able to say, I can look in the mirror and I can change my circumstances. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3031.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3039.08s)]
*  I screwed up. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3040.6s)]
*  I can make it better. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3042.04s)]
*  And I will. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3043.4s)]
*  Blame yourself first. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3044.2s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3045.16s)]
*  Always. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3045.96s)]
*  And we hold each other up to that standard. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3047.0s)]
*  That is not what the black community is being taught now about black preachers, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3049.3199999999997s)]
*  black politicians, black civil rights workers. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3052.52s)]
*  Everything is the government. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3054.04s)]
*  Everything is a white man. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3055.0s)]
*  Everything is white supremacy. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3056.12s)]
*  As I've said before, you talk about equality. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3057.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, who you want me to be equal to? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3059.48s)]
*  Whom? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3060.68s)]
*  Point him out to me. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3061.3999999999996s)]
*  Show me the white man that you want, Ben Ellison, to stand up and say, I want to be equal to you. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3065.3999999999996s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3072.2799999999997s)]
*  You're talking about white supremacy, white supremacy, white supremacy. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3073.64s)]
*  There's no black, white privilege. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3077.56s)]
*  That's the way it is a privilege to be white. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3081.3199999999997s)]
*  But it's also a privilege to be black. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3083.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a privilege to be an American. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3085.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a privilege to be a Christian in America. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3087.96s)]
*  It's a privilege to be alive today. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3090.9199999999996s)]

*  I like to see it. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3107.08s)]
*  We'll put it to the test. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3107.96s)]
*  Superior to me. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3110.7599999999998s)]
*  You know what? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3111.64s)]
*  We all have gifts. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3112.12s)]

*  And when a man finds that spark and finds his gifts, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3132.3599999999997s)]
*  isn't the world a beautiful place? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3135.8799999999997s)]

*  You have a pain in your chest. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3145.0s)]

*  And when we find these gifts, the world is a beautiful place. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3152.84s)]
*  And we are supposed to help each other find these gifts. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3156.36s)]
*  We're supposed to elevate one another because we depend on one another. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3158.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3162.12s)]
*  We all do. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3163.16s)]

*  This is why our 10th commandment said, thou shalt not covet anything of your neighbor, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3187.72s)]
*  not your gift, not your possessions, not your wife, nothing. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3193.3999999999996s)]

*  You need to pay your fair share. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3219.88s)]
*  You know, and then you feed this to children and tell them that if somebody else has something [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3222.04s)]
*  that you want, you have a right to go to government and tell government, I want that. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3228.1200000000003s)]
*  Then government comes and puts a gun in their hands and says, you're going to give that up. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3231.8s)]
*  And we've created a sick society that believes that. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3235.48s)]
*  And it all came out of the civil rights movement. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3239.0s)]
*  What's your dad do? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3241.48s)]

*  he did insurance. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3250.36s)]

*  music program in Brownsville and did that till three or four years ago. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3257.96s)]
*  Three or four years ago. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3261.72s)]
*  That is one of the most well-respected people in that area. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3263.24s)]
*  Because of his influence on radio, he's charities, raised money for people, programs. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3268.52s)]
*  He started out basically orphaned by his parents, raised as a son of sharecroppers. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3280.3599999999997s)]
*  And then he started doing that. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3288.6s)]
*  And he, he aspired and he got a job in the insurance industry. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3290.28s)]
*  He bought us out of poverty. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3295.0s)]
*  And he had a heart attack when he was 55 years old that killed, this is not hyperbole Tucker, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3296.92s)]
*  killed everybody in the world that ever had it. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3305.1600000000003s)]
*  He was, he is, he's a medical anomaly. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3309.2400000000002s)]
*  People all over the world came to study him to see how he was still alive. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3311.6400000000003s)]
*  Much less the fact that he was walking around every day and working without needing oxygen. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3316.36s)]
*  It's still unexplainable to doctors how he's done it. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3322.36s)]
*  How old is he? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3325.56s)]
*  That is 80, he'll be 82 on his birthday, June 12th. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3326.68s)]
*  Now, when the doctor, we were at Vanderbilt hospital and the, he didn't want my brothers, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3330.36s)]
*  my sisters and my mother to hear this. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3338.52s)]
*  So he called me and my brother in and he said, I want you all to hear what the doctor is telling [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3339.72s)]
*  me here so y'all know what's really going on. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3343.88s)]
*  And the doctor said, if your father didn't have a heart transplant, he'll be dead in six months. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3345.88s)]
*  And we were like, we were shocked because we didn't know it was this bad. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3350.6s)]
*  And dad said, now I want y'all to also hear what I'm going to tell this doctor. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3354.52s)]
*  He said, I know you're the best heart surgeon in the state. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3357.88s)]
*  I appreciate what you told me, but I'm going to tell you this. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3361.4s)]
*  I'm not going anywhere. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3364.52s)]
*  God's going to heal me. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3365.4s)]
*  And the doctor said, Mr. Elson, I appreciate your faith. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3367.0s)]
*  You're going to be dead in six months if you don't get a heart. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3368.76s)]
*  Yeah, that was, oh, 27 years ago. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3370.92s)]
*  I asked dad, I said, how did you know that you were going to be healed? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3376.92s)]
*  You're going to be taking care of him. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3381.88s)]
*  His two grandparents were elderly. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3384.44s)]
*  Well, his two parents that really were very elderly and he took care of them [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3385.88s)]
*  till the day they died, took care of them. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3389.8s)]
*  He said, my Bible says, if you honor your father and your mother, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3392.28s)]
*  that God promises you three score and 10 years, that's 70 years. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3395.56s)]
*  He said, I was only 55 years old. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3399.48s)]
*  God still loves me 15 years. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3400.84s)]
*  That's what he told me. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3403.88s)]
*  And he's still thriving. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3406.04s)]
*  That's how much he believes in his faith. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3408.12s)]
*  And I learned all of that from him. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3410.44s)]
*  This absoluteness that it is a journey. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3412.44s)]
*  And he says, I've seen the ending of the book. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3416.84s)]
*  I've already, I came from the front and I've gotten to the back of it. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3420.92s)]
*  And I read the last page and guess what? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3424.28s)]
*  I win. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3426.36s)]
*  So at one point you were telling me at breakfast that [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3429.56s)]
*  your family was a touring gospel group. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3435.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, man. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3437.8s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3438.52s)]
*  We, it wasn't fun for us. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3439.08s)]
*  I ain't going to lie. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3440.76s)]
*  Dad always loved music. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3444.52s)]
*  He just always loved it. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3445.8s)]
*  And he's singing quartets when he was younger. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3447.0s)]
*  And guys wouldn't do right, you know, bringing women. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3450.84s)]
*  Wouldn't show up drinking. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3455.4s)]
*  So he decided that he still loved to sing, but he wanted to do it in a more of a controlled [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3457.48s)]
*  situation. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3461.48s)]
*  So he taught us. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3462.04s)]
*  One day he came in with a truckload of instruments and told us we were going to learn to play them. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3463.64s)]
*  Vince hears the bass, Bubba hears the drums, and I'm going to teach y'all to play. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3469.88s)]
*  And we said, okay. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3475.2400000000002s)]
*  And he taught us three-part harmony, taught us some songs. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3477.8s)]
*  And we started going throughout the South and we got better and better. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3481.0s)]
*  You played bass? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3483.72s)]
*  I played bass and I played lead guitar. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3484.52s)]
*  And I ended up playing keyboards by the end of it. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3486.2s)]
*  Every time he bought, every time somebody else got old enough to join the group, I had [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3488.7599999999998s)]
*  to teach them my instrument and then go learn another one. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3492.68s)]
*  And so I taught my brother the bass and then I went to the lead guitar. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3495.0s)]
*  And then I had another brother come in and then I went to the keyboards. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3499.56s)]
*  And we did that until I was about 24 years old. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3504.9199999999996s)]
*  We have three albums out. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3508.3599999999997s)]
*  They had a slew of 45s. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3510.3599999999997s)]
*  I always am very, very happy when I go back to West Tennessee and people tell me that [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3513.24s)]
*  they still have our albums in their homes and the pictures of us in their homes. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3517.3199999999997s)]
*  And look, Tucker, we were so, this thing was so ingrained in our DNA. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3522.2s)]
*  We hadn't played together really in 25 years. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3527.4799999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3531.08s)]
*  So Dad was having an anniversary and everybody thought it would be fun for us to play a couple [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3531.72s)]
*  songs. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3539.48s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm just going to be a train wreck. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3540.92s)]
*  So we all showed up at the church to practice. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3543.48s)]
*  We hadn't played in 25 years. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3545.88s)]
*  This is literally the truth. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3547.2400000000002s)]
*  So we all plugged in the instruments, me and my brothers and sisters. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3548.6s)]
*  And we said, okay, first of all, we're going to set a rule here. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3551.08s)]
*  If this doesn't sound well, anybody can veto this and say, we don't do this. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3554.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3559.08s)]
*  Everybody said, all right, cool. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3560.04s)]
*  Anybody can say we're not doing it and it's done. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3561.88s)]
*  Right, cool. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3563.96s)]
*  We plugged in and we did a song and we hit it. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3564.6800000000003s)]
*  Boom. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3567.1600000000003s)]
*  And everything was like we did yesterday. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3567.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3569.4s)]
*  And we all just died laughing. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3571.2400000000002s)]
*  We just fell out laughing because we thought it'd be some rust. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3573.88s)]
*  We thought that it would be, we forget. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3578.44s)]
*  No, it was like we were 18 years old playing it again. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3580.6s)]
*  And we were like, oh my God, this is ingrained in us. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3585.1600000000003s)]
*  So we got such a big kick out of it once or twice a year. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3591.2400000000002s)]
*  Now we'll just show up at the house. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3594.44s)]
*  Dad called us two weeks ago and said, hey, I want to have a jam session. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3595.72s)]
*  I live in Virginia. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3602.3599999999997s)]
*  He lives in Brownsville. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3603.16s)]
*  It's about maybe 10 hours away. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3605.64s)]
*  And when dad didn't call the actual much, when he calls, we all come. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3607.56s)]
*  And we all show up at the house and we sit around for about five hours playing the guitars [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3611.0s)]
*  and singing and just had a great time. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3615.9599999999996s)]
*  And that's what we do. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3617.48s)]
*  Whenever he calls, we show up, we plug up, we play. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3618.6s)]
*  And it's just like we never ever left. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3621.72s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3623.24s)]
*  And you're playing gospel? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3623.7999999999997s)]
*  Gospel music, yeah. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3624.84s)]
*  Dad didn't allow blues music playing in the house. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3626.28s)]
*  Why? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3629.4s)]
*  Even though you're in the Delta. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3630.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3632.2000000000003s)]
*  It was new then. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3634.1200000000003s)]
*  It was when the transition was being made from all music during that time [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3635.0s)]
*  was gospel music before Staxx and Motown. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3641.08s)]
*  It was all church. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3643.96s)]
*  And then Staxx and Motown started taking the music and turning it into R&B and blues. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3645.8s)]
*  And people during that time was saying that if you left gospel and went to R&B and blues, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3651.08s)]
*  you went from the church to the devil. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3655.48s)]
*  That was it. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3658.68s)]
*  You went to the devil. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3659.48s)]
*  People offered my father tons of money for us to start singing R&B and blues. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3662.2799999999997s)]
*  Tons. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3666.2799999999997s)]
*  He would never take it. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3666.92s)]
*  Really? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3667.7999999999997s)]
*  Never, never. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3669.24s)]
*  So you were touring to church. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3670.36s)]
*  You were performing in churches. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3671.88s)]
*  Churches, period. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3673.08s)]
*  He would not take, he wouldn't let us go secular at all. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3673.88s)]
*  And they saw it as that. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3678.2s)]
*  You remember Al Green, the great souls of Al Green? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3681.0s)]
*  When all the bad stuff started happening, Al Green, he turned back to the church because [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3683.7999999999997s)]
*  he said, I shouldn't, this is my punishment. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3686.52s)]
*  And as life went on and you started seeing what started happening to a lot of those gospel music. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3689.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3694.7599999999998s)]
*  It went R&B and kind of, you know. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3696.12s)]
*  Their lives blew up. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3697.96s)]
*  For sure, yeah. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3699.24s)]
*  So again, dad saved us from that though. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3700.3599999999997s)]
*  So on that circuit, pardon my ignorance, I'm from La Jolla. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3703.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3706.84s)]
*  But you just drive to another town, another church, you just roll in and- [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3708.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we would, dad would have the, he would have the, he'd have the program set up. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3712.28s)]
*  We didn't know where we were going usually. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3716.84s)]
*  I'd ask him on the day off. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3717.96s)]
*  And we would get up and we'd go to church on Sunday morning. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3719.5600000000004s)]
*  We'd load up our instruments. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3722.44s)]
*  Then we'd go to church. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3724.28s)]
*  Then we would leave the church and we wouldn't, and we would drive probably an hour, maybe two [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3725.96s)]
*  hours, no more than three, but he would have two programs kind of set up in the same area. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3730.28s)]
*  So we would show up at the church. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3734.76s)]
*  We would get out of church about 11 o'clock. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3737.08s)]
*  We'd show up at the other church about one or two o'clock. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3739.0s)]
*  We'd set up, we'd sing. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3742.44s)]
*  We'd get out about maybe five o'clock. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3745.16s)]
*  We'd go eat dinner somewhere. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3748.12s)]
*  We had to be at the next church at seven. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3749.8s)]
*  And then we'd go sing there. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3751.88s)]
*  We'd get out there about 10 o'clock. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3753.0s)]
*  We'd get home about maybe one in the morning. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3755.16s)]
*  We'd unload the instruments and we'd go to bed and we'd get up and we'd go to school. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3758.2s)]
*  And that was it. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3762.76s)]
*  And that's what we did. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3764.52s)]
*  That sounds grueling. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3765.5600000000004s)]
*  It was grueling. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3767.6400000000003s)]
*  And we would do it sometimes on Saturdays also. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3769.0s)]
*  But it kept us out of trouble. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3772.36s)]
*  It gave us a type of respect in the community. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3777.0800000000004s)]
*  The people looked out for us because they always saw us doing that. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3781.0800000000004s)]
*  And they respected us as young men doing that. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3788.6800000000003s)]
*  And they held us in high esteem for doing it. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3791.88s)]
*  And many of the blessings that me and my family are enjoying now, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3795.32s)]
*  people are saying is attributed to us putting forth those efforts as children [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3801.2400000000002s)]
*  going and singing gospel music all around Tennessee. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3806.44s)]
*  And I believe that. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3808.36s)]
*  Do you still listen to gospel? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3808.92s)]
*  Oh man, love it. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3810.04s)]
*  Love it. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3811.32s)]
*  Oh, love it. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3811.96s)]
*  Don't stop listening to it. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3813.32s)]
*  So for people who didn't grow up listening to gospel music but think it's pretty great, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3814.52s)]
*  how would you start? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3820.36s)]
*  Who would you recommend listening to if you got Spotify? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3821.08s)]
*  Tasha Cobb Leonard. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3824.7599999999998s)]
*  She's just awesome. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3826.12s)]
*  If you ever listen to Tasha Cobb, she touches your soul. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3827.56s)]
*  She's young and she's vibrant. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3830.12s)]
*  She does great music. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3831.64s)]
*  Great music. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3832.92s)]
*  Tasha Cobb. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3833.24s)]
*  She's very good. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3834.68s)]
*  It's getting more secularized now. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3839.4s)]
*  You hear Kirk Franklin and all them jumping around. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3841.72s)]
*  And you can't really tell the soul music, I mean the gospel music from the R&B music [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3843.72s)]
*  in some ways now. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3848.7599999999998s)]
*  We have to be, it has to get back to the roots. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3851.64s)]
*  This is not show business. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3855.08s)]
*  This is communion. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3857.72s)]
*  This is worship. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3859.64s)]
*  It's not, you're not coming there to be entertained. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3861.4s)]
*  You're coming there to commune, to be involved, to worship, to praise God in song. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3864.2799999999997s)]
*  And many times people now will look at a concert, a hip hop concert, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3872.36s)]
*  and think that they are there to be fed in that way. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3878.6s)]
*  And so you'll find gospel groups now with lights and smoke and explosions and costumes. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3881.96s)]
*  And this is entertainment, you know? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3890.6s)]
*  God doesn't need all that. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3893.4s)]
*  Jesus did the sermon on the mount, right? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3894.44s)]
*  He didn't even have a mic. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3895.8s)]
*  He just walked up there and rocked it. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3897.0s)]
*  And we still remember the sermon because it touched people. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3899.24s)]
*  It touched people. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3903.48s)]
*  And that's what gospel music is supposed to do. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3905.4s)]
*  It's supposed to touch the soul. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3907.32s)]
*  Spirit touches spirit. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3908.6000000000004s)]
*  And when you go to a real gospel concert and it's communion and it's the people coming [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3910.6000000000004s)]
*  together to commune and worship, it's a life-changing experience. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3917.1600000000003s)]
*  Did you ever play for white audiences? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3919.8s)]
*  We would do it very, very sporadically. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3922.04s)]
*  We would do it in Brownsville. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3924.1200000000003s)]
*  We had this white gospel group called the Laymen and we would do a concert together [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3925.2400000000002s)]
*  with them in the gym in Haywood County. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3931.7200000000003s)]
*  And black and white people would come to the concert and we would sing together and we [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3935.0s)]
*  would commune together in that way. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3939.0s)]
*  But it's very rare that we sang it from the white audiences. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3940.52s)]
*  Very rare. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3942.84s)]
*  Is there a difference? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3944.36s)]
*  No, not really. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3945.88s)]
*  When you start doing Southern gospel, you know, that's why Elvis was so hypnotic to [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3947.24s)]
*  people. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3952.2s)]
*  Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Caron. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3953.56s)]
*  I'll tell you, they go to black churches, listen to black music. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3958.04s)]
*  They play with black people. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3960.28s)]
*  If you ever go to Memphis and go to Sun Studios or go to Stax, you'll be amazed at the [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3961.56s)]
*  emergence of black and white people in those studios working together all the time. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3967.0800000000004s)]
*  B.B. King and Elvis worked very close together, knew each other. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3971.6400000000003s)]
*  Black and white musicians loved and played together. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3975.88s)]
*  They learned. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3979.0s)]
*  Elvis stayed on Beale Street. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3979.48s)]
*  They knew him on Beale Street. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3981.1600000000003s)]
*  So the music brought people together. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3983.0s)]
*  It always did. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3985.7200000000003s)]
*  Elvis would hear about a black concert. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3988.36s)]
*  Gospel singing in Memphis. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3990.84s)]
*  And he'd just show up. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3992.36s)]
*  And people said they'd look around. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3993.8s)]
*  Elvis was in the church. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3994.84s)]
*  And now listen to a gospel group sing. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3995.56s)]
*  He knew them all. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3997.2400000000002s)]
*  But it brought them all together. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=3998.84s)]
*  The music always brought people together. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4001.0s)]
*  They always enjoyed it. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4003.4s)]
*  And there's just this lie going on around the nation that made believe that we were [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4005.2400000000002s)]
*  all there fighting and getting hung and lynched and race riot. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4009.8s)]
*  I don't saw anything like that growing up. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4013.2400000000002s)]
*  So, I mean, it's interesting. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4015.0s)]
*  So you were growing up at the end of segregation. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4016.6800000000003s)]
*  Literally. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4020.2s)]
*  What were the racial relations like? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4021.32s)]
*  They were fine. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4023.0s)]
*  I mean, I just didn't see it or feel it, Tucker. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4024.04s)]
*  I just wasn't there. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4027.56s)]
*  I was never mistreated by white people when I was growing up. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4031.08s)]
*  I asked my father this question the last time I saw him. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4035.16s)]
*  I said, Dad, how do white people treat you growing up here? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4037.72s)]
*  He said, I've never been mistreated by white people. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4041.48s)]
*  My father actually told me that out of his mouth. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4043.88s)]
*  I've never been mistreated by white people here, ever. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4045.88s)]
*  See, Martin Luther King told us he was dreaming about a day [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4049.0s)]
*  that you will not be judged by the color of your skin, by the content of your character. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4052.12s)]
*  You will be judged by the content of your character. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4056.04s)]
*  It is inescapable. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4058.36s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4059.96s)]
*  But he gave black people a fallback position. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4061.08s)]
*  People are being judged by the content of their character and they can say, no, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4064.2799999999997s)]
*  it's the color of my skin. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4067.16s)]
*  You can't correct skin color. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4068.92s)]
*  You can't correct character. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4070.6s)]
*  So many people that didn't have what they wanted. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4072.92s)]
*  Weren't getting what they wanted. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4078.52s)]
*  It wasn't based upon their skin color. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4080.04s)]
*  It was based upon their character, but they were being told it was their skin color. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4081.64s)]
*  Martin Luther King, for instance, had never been to a public school in his life. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4086.04s)]
*  Went to a Crowes Theological Seminary. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4091.0s)]
*  He went to Boston University. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4094.52s)]
*  Never was hungry. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4099.24s)]
*  His dad went to Morehouse College. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4100.04s)]
*  Have you seen his house in Atlanta? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4101.64s)]
*  He lived in a Victorian style, almost like a mansion. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4103.16s)]
*  He's not a poor guy. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4107.0s)]
*  Nobody bothered him. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4108.28s)]
*  He was a… [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4110.12s)]
*  At 26, he was the head pastor of a large church in Montgomery, Alabama. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4111.48s)]
*  He was driving a Cadillac. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4114.92s)]
*  Living in an upper-cost black area town. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4116.84s)]
*  His wife was a college graduate. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4120.04s)]
*  That was a black intelligentsia as a white intelligentsia that had money and lived well. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4122.44s)]
*  And then you had poor whites and you had poor blacks. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4127.8s)]
*  It's just how the world works. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4130.68s)]
*  Somehow or another though, in the minds of black people in the South, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4132.68s)]
*  they always said, I can only feel whole if I am loved by white racists. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4136.120000000001s)]
*  I gotta make this clan member love me. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4143.56s)]
*  I got to. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4147.56s)]
*  And it was a type of weird ignorance in that. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4149.8s)]
*  That I can only feel good about myself if I'm sitting beside you on a bus or on a toilet [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4153.160000000001s)]
*  or eating a hamburger beside you. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4160.44s)]
*  Right now, I can only be concerned about one thing. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4164.5199999999995s)]
*  Is the bus taking me to the same spot? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4166.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4168.36s)]

*  Now, what about that? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4174.44s)]
*  Muhammad Ali says, a sick mind that wants to be somewhere where he's not wanted. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4176.679999999999s)]

*  They call them stalkers. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4181.5599999999995s)]

*  None. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4187.5599999999995s)]
*  If you don't want me here, you think I'm going to fight to be beside you? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4188.68s)]
*  We don't serve N words. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4193.32s)]
*  Well, I'm not one. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4194.84s)]
*  But since you called me that, you can't have my money and I don't want to eat here. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4197.56s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4203.16s)]
*  Instead, oh, no, no, I'm going to make you take my money. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4204.28s)]
*  What? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4207.0s)]
*  Insanity. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4209.4800000000005s)]
*  Absolute ins- [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4211.08s)]

*  A lot of people think that the Montgomery Bus Boycott ended the segregation on the buses. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4223.0s)]
*  It didn't. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4227.64s)]
*  It was NAACP. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4228.12s)]
*  They had a Supreme Court decision that did it. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4229.32s)]
*  Martin Luther King's Bus Boycott just aggravated a lot of people. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4231.32s)]
*  They didn't do anything. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4234.28s)]
*  And then people don't know this. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4235.08s)]
*  Two years later, the black people sat in the back of the bus again because of white intimidation. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4236.68s)]
*  Yes, they went back to the back of the bus voluntarily in Montgomery, Alabama. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4241.56s)]
*  They don't talk about that little tidbit of history. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4246.04s)]
*  They don't tell people that Rosa Parks wasn't operative. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4248.6s)]
*  Trained at the Highlander Folk School, a communist training camp in Montego, Tennessee. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4251.32s)]
*  King, Ralph Abernathy, all of them went there. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4255.64s)]
*  Led by these three communists, Dumb Broski and Miles Norton and all of them. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4258.76s)]
*  They keep that part of a history secret. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4263.16s)]
*  Yeah, there was a communist training camp in Montego, Tennessee. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4265.16s)]
*  They tore it down in the 60s because they found there was a communist training camp. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4267.4800000000005s)]
*  And they're the ones that were training all these people how to use non-violence [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4271.4s)]
*  resistance to cause violence. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4274.2s)]
*  Cause violence. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4275.56s)]
*  They went down to Montgomery and Birmingham and said, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4279.400000000001s)]
*  we're going to jug at Bull Connor until people start getting water hoses and dogsick on them. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4281.4800000000005s)]
*  The concept is to cause violence. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4286.68s)]
*  To aggravate you until you strike out at me. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4288.92s)]
*  It's me coming up in your face. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4291.160000000001s)]
*  So I go, and then finally he said, Vince, you gotta leave me alone now. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4292.200000000001s)]
*  I'll never touch you. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4296.76s)]
*  But I put my finger in your face and I messed it up. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4298.120000000001s)]
*  Probably just. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4300.6s)]
*  And then I said, he talkers violent. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4302.280000000001s)]
*  You know, and those were their tactics. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4305.72s)]
*  And they did nothing good came out of it because the black people are poor in Selma [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4310.120000000001s)]
*  and Montgomery and they've ever been. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4314.200000000001s)]
*  I've noticed that no one seems to care. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4316.360000000001s)]
*  They don't care because it was about getting the vote for the democratic party. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4318.120000000001s)]
*  So they could take it over. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4322.52s)]
*  There were five million, six million latent black votes down south, black votes down south that [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4324.76s)]
*  they could use. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4329.4800000000005s)]
*  And they understood that Stockholm syndrome was going to take over. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4330.76s)]
*  They were going to vote for the democratic party. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4333.240000000001s)]
*  As a matter of fact, if you read the history of that time, when the election of 1960 was going on, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4334.6s)]
*  Martin Luther King Jr. and the rest of them put this thing called a blue bomb. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4340.04s)]
*  It was a blue piece of paper that they passed to all the churches in the south. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4343.88s)]
*  And it was talking about how Martin Luther King Jr. was locked up in jail. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4352.200000000001s)]
*  The JFK had given Martin Luther King Jr. a phone call and it talked to his wife and Richard Nixon [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4355.400000000001s)]
*  did not. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4361.72s)]
*  And that was enough to get 80% of the black people to vote for JFK down south during the election of 1960 [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4362.76s)]
*  and beat Nixon who had supported the 1957 Civil Rights Act and the 1960 Civil Rights Act. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4370.2s)]
*  They gave them the right to vote anyway. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4376.52s)]
*  But it was the blue bomb that did it. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4378.76s)]
*  And it was them again leveraging the black preacher who, if you want to talk to an ignorant joker, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4381.16s)]
*  talk to most black preachers in the United States of America. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4388.68s)]
*  Man, these guys don't know anything about foreign policy, don't know anything about government. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4391.400000000001s)]
*  All they know about how to get money in their hands for taking black people to the polls [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4396.12s)]
*  and vote for the Democratic Party. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4400.12s)]
*  And again, if you want- [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4403.0s)]
*  Is that still the case that the get out the vote operation in the south among Democrats is still [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4404.12s)]
*  heavily reliant on black preachers? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4411.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah, you ever heard of Souls to the Polls? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4413.32s)]
*  No. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4415.16s)]
*  Oh yeah, man, you should look it up. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4415.64s)]
*  Souls to the Polls is an organization that's funded by George Soros and his people. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4417.88s)]
*  And they give every Sunday before the first Tuesday in November, these churches will use [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4423.08s)]
*  church buses to put their congregants into these buses and take them to the polls and have them vote. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4431.64s)]
*  And this is unspoken, but for every black person that they can get in the bus, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4440.36s)]
*  they get about $10, $15. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4443.64s)]
*  And in my documentary, where you would help for me, I have a picture of Raphael Warnock [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4445.240000000001s)]
*  and John Lewis standing in front of a Souls to the Polls bus. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4450.92s)]
*  It got Souls to the Polls written on it. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4452.84s)]
*  So yeah, everybody can look up Souls to the Polls and they'll see that it is something. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4455.320000000001s)]
*  Matter of fact, before the election this year, Kamala Harris was out there talking about Souls [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4458.200000000001s)]
*  to the Polls. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4463.56s)]
*  They were out there rallying it. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4463.96s)]
*  Yeah, and it's all about the black church. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4466.280000000001s)]
*  But why, I mean, the program of the modern Democratic Party is about as aggressively [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4470.12s)]
*  anti-Christian as, well, it is the most aggressively anti-Christian platform of any [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4476.12s)]
*  movement in the history of the country. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4481.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4482.599999999999s)]
*  So how could any preacher participate in that? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4483.08s)]
*  Two things. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4486.76s)]
*  They either know it and are corrupt or they're ignorant to it, which most of them are. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4488.44s)]
*  You'll be amazed how many people, I mean, when you and I did the [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4495.08s)]
*  show on George Floyd in October, how it went viral. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4500.12s)]
*  And that's when Biden's numbers started tanking because we just exposed so many lies [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4504.5199999999995s)]
*  in the interview. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4509.24s)]
*  I mean, it just went viral. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4509.88s)]
*  When I went to World Overcomers in Memphis, people were just talking about the interview. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4512.76s)]
*  They were showing it to me. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4516.84s)]
*  They had it on their phones. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4517.8s)]
*  And they thanked me for educating them on my podcast, the Miss Everybody Else Show. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4520.44s)]
*  I educate. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4527.32s)]
*  I tell people this is what they stand for. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4528.44s)]
*  Most people and the Republican Party and the GOP is very bad at messaging. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4532.04s)]
*  You think? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4537.08s)]
*  Them suckas can't sell a dollar for 50 cent. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4538.2s)]
*  They're horrible. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4541.5599999999995s)]
*  So if you ask black people, how do you feel about LGBTQ? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4543.719999999999s)]
*  I hate it. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4546.759999999999s)]
*  How do you feel about abortion? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4547.16s)]
*  Can't stand it. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4547.96s)]
*  How do you feel about guns? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4548.36s)]
*  I want my gun. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4549.16s)]
*  How do you feel about school choice? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4550.679999999999s)]
*  I want school choice. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4551.799999999999s)]
*  How do you feel about abortion? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4552.44s)]
*  We need legal immigration. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4553.32s)]
*  They'll give you everything. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4555.24s)]
*  And then you say, well, what party do you think supports your point of view? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4557.32s)]
*  Democrats do. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4560.28s)]
*  Now, why would you think that? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4563.08s)]
*  Nobody's told them any different. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4565.799999999999s)]
*  So when I show them that the Democratic Party is up for abortion for the ninth month, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4567.799999999999s)]
*  it startles them. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4572.28s)]
*  When I show them that Obamacare and the Democratic Party is for castrating little [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4573.879999999999s)]
*  boys and calling them little girls, giving double mastectomies to little girls and calling [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4577.639999999999s)]
*  them little boys, it startles them. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4580.44s)]
*  When I show them the Democratic Party votes against school choice, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4583.719999999999s)]
*  every single time, and has used the public education to say, God is not welcomed here. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4586.2s)]
*  He's not welcomed here. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4594.12s)]
*  And that they won't allow us to let Christian education come to the public school. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4595.88s)]
*  They're startled. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4599.8s)]
*  When they caught on to the fact that Biden is letting all the illegals across the border, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4601.0s)]
*  they caught on to that. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4605.24s)]
*  When you talk about gun control, they finally caught on to that. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4606.68s)]
*  That's why it's as though they're tanking there too. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4609.4s)]
*  Really? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4611.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4612.04s)]
*  They see the Hispanics, the illegals, come into their communities. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4612.68s)]
*  And they're upset. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4618.280000000001s)]
*  Their rents are going up. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4619.8s)]
*  They are opening up. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4621.88s)]
*  Their schools are getting crowded out. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4623.88s)]
*  What really made them angry is when they start seeing them giving these guys people debit [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4626.04s)]
*  cards for $3,500 on it. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4630.200000000001s)]
*  They said, man, hey! [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4631.96s)]
*  And when they see they won't take them to jail, whereas their son gets a $50 speeding ticket [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4633.240000000001s)]
*  and can't pay it. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4641.320000000001s)]
*  They'll take him downtown. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4641.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4642.92s)]
*  If he can't pay his child support, they'll put him in jail for two years and they won't [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4643.4800000000005s)]
*  take his Hispanic down. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4645.96s)]
*  Our family's been here 400 years and we can't get a free school. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4646.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4649.16s)]
*  When they saw that there are men that cannot get work but Joe Biden gives a $400,000 work [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4649.96s)]
*  visas out to Venezuelans. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4655.64s)]
*  And they say, hell, I need a job. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4658.6s)]
*  They saw that in real time, up close and personal. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4661.0s)]
*  It was, what do they say, all politics are local? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4664.04s)]
*  They saw this locally. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4667.0s)]
*  But see, the GOP has been not very good at explaining to people that the voucher program [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4669.08s)]
*  in DC is loved by the majority of the people that are there. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4676.36s)]
*  Black people benefit from it and Barack Obama and Democrats kill it every chance they get. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4679.4s)]
*  We don't put, we will say the teachers unions. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4684.84s)]
*  Well, the teachers unions aren't on the ballot, are they? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4688.36s)]
*  The Democrats are. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4691.5599999999995s)]
*  You don't say teachers unions. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4693.16s)]
*  You said the Democrats are stopping it. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4694.44s)]
*  When you start talking about LGBTQ, you don't say LGBTQ. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4696.52s)]
*  If you do, you connect it to the Democrats and say they are the ones that support it. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4699.88s)]
*  They have to know who their enemy is and it has to be known absolutely. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4703.88s)]
*  When Jesus Christ went in front of the Jews, when he was at the temple, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4711.56s)]
*  and they were all wondering why they're being treated so badly, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4716.200000000001s)]
*  they were all angry at the Romans, right? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4720.52s)]
*  Christ said, don't worry about the Romans. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4723.0s)]
*  Your problem is them jokers right over there, the Pharisees and the Sadducees. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4725.8s)]
*  And they said, huh, liars, hypocrites, generation of vipers. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4730.2s)]
*  And he just went off. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4734.92s)]
*  And that's when they said, he's got to die. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4737.400000000001s)]
*  He said, oh, it's not the Romans. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4739.72s)]
*  They're not your problem. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4741.16s)]
*  Suckers right over there. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4742.6s)]
*  And see, we have failed to do this. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4744.04s)]
*  And this is why my book, The Iron Triangle, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4745.320000000001s)]
*  Book Authority gave it number 61 on the greatest political books [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4747.72s)]

*  It told what the most black preachers and black politicians [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4756.76s)]
*  and black civil rights organizers were doing. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4759.8s)]
*  We've heard them in high esteem. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4761.96s)]
*  Oh, the NAACP is great. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4763.16s)]
*  Oh, you know, Martin Luther King and June Civil Rights Movement is great. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4764.68s)]
*  Oh, the black caucuses. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4767.4800000000005s)]
*  They said, no, they're not. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4768.68s)]
*  They're the enemy. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4770.2s)]
*  And then people say, huh, your problem is not the white conservative. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4771.56s)]
*  Your problem is them jokers right over there. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4776.360000000001s)]
*  If you ever take a moment to sit down and talk to your white conservative neighbor, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4779.64s)]

*  They take some, just good neighbors, great people. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4871.08s)]
*  But they're men. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4875.8s)]
*  And you are not going to walk up to them and tell them that they're responsible for your plight. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4878.2s)]
*  And they have done nothing to you. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4882.360000000001s)]

*  Of course not. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4887.08s)]

*  Can I ask you a, well, two questions just about family dynamics. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4896.12s)]
*  So why is it that, you know, women are obviously much less violent than men [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4900.52s)]
*  on average, but men, boys who grew up in a female headed household tend to be more violent. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4906.04s)]
*  What is that? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4913.4800000000005s)]
*  Men are violent. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4914.84s)]

*  Not fathers teach us a temperate. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4918.4400000000005s)]
*  They teach us control. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4921.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4922.84s)]
*  From the time we come home from the hospital until the time we leave his house, control yourself. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4923.400000000001s)]
*  My father had to teach me how to sleep alone. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4931.0s)]
*  My mother would let me sleep with her until the, until I was 18 years old. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4932.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4936.04s)]
*  Of course. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4936.4400000000005s)]

*  No, he has to learn to sleep alone. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4941.08s)]
*  That's the father. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4944.04s)]
*  Oh, but you know, my mama picked him up, put him down, let him walk. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4945.56s)]
*  He's too big to carry. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4948.76s)]
*  I know, put him down. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4949.72s)]

*  She puts him down. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4954.28s)]

*  Father, put him down, let him learn to walk. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4958.76s)]
*  Fathers know these things. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4960.28s)]
*  He sets up under his mother. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4961.72s)]
*  He starts crying, run to his mother. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4962.84s)]
*  Get away from your mother. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4963.88s)]
*  Leave her. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4964.52s)]
*  Dads do that. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4967.400000000001s)]
*  But if dad's not there, mother's going to automatically grab him and baby him and rock him. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4968.4400000000005s)]
*  So he never learns to temper himself. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4973.16s)]
*  Even now, when it comes down to the whole LGBTQ thing, right? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4975.0s)]
*  Do what you want to do. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4977.96s)]
*  Your father says, no, no, no, control yourself. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4978.68s)]

*  Why have a male detraction? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4985.400000000001s)]
*  You better control that. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4986.4400000000005s)]
*  Why? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=4988.76s)]

*  Again, Vladimir Putin has made it plain. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5181.16s)]
*  He said this western satanic way of living stops here. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5183.8s)]
*  When I have this LGBTQ stuff here in Russia, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5189.56s)]
*  when I have these anti-Christian, anti-American values here in Russia, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5192.92s)]
*  I read a story inside Washington Post that he's militarizing the people [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5196.4400000000005s)]
*  to defend his country against it. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5199.16s)]
*  He said no, it stops. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5202.2s)]
*  The Russian Orthodox Church said no, it stops. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5204.84s)]
*  You have Viktor Orban in Hungary concerned about it. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5208.92s)]
*  It's coming. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5212.6s)]
*  They said no, it's not. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5213.4s)]
*  You have Xi Jinping said it's not coming over here [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5214.36s)]
*  and the African nations are saying the same thing. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5216.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5218.04s)]
*  And right now, we have people in America that have an agenda [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5219.4800000000005s)]
*  and it's a worldwide agenda. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5222.68s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why they were going into Ukraine. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5224.92s)]
*  I read this thing from, oh God, I forget where I got it. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5227.4800000000005s)]
*  It's in my new book. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5229.8s)]
*  But the guy said that to get in the EU, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5231.08s)]
*  one of the things they had to do was have a gay pride parade in Kiev. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5234.6s)]
*  It's one of the things you're going to have to do. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5239.16s)]
*  They had to get a great gay pride parade [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5243.4800000000005s)]
*  and then they brought it to the Dumbass region [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5245.64s)]
*  and that's when stuff broke off [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5247.0s)]
*  because Vladimir says no, you're taking it too far now. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5249.400000000001s)]
*  That's when all the wheels started rolling [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5251.96s)]
*  and they knew that the EU and NATO was coming in [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5253.88s)]
*  because these are the things that they do. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5256.04s)]
*  And then they press the ideology further and further. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5258.28s)]
*  So now Biden has tied most of Americans foreign policy money [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5260.68s)]
*  to LGBTQ climate change and abortion. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5265.16s)]
*  If you don't allow these things, you don't get the money anymore. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5268.36s)]
*  And the African nations are saying, what? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5270.84s)]
*  People are starving. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5273.72s)]
*  Well, if you don't do this, they'll starve. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5275.4800000000005s)]
*  And so guess who comes and fills the gap? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5277.72s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5279.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5281.0s)]
*  Or Xi Jinping. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5281.96s)]
*  And Xi Jinping. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5282.6s)]
*  Abortion thing is particularly confusing to me [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5283.64s)]
*  in the United States among black voters [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5287.56s)]
*  because it's so obviously genocidal. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5290.2s)]
*  And if you look at the numbers on whose babies are being aborted [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5294.36s)]
*  and where the abortion clinics are, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5299.0s)]
*  it's wildly disproportionate in the black community. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5300.44s)]
*  And it does seem like, first of all, it's not an accident, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5304.36s)]
*  but second, it's such a clear sign. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5307.56s)]
*  I can claim I love you, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5309.88s)]
*  but if I'm putting an abortion clinic in your neighborhood [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5311.8s)]
*  and encouraging you not to have children, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5314.2s)]
*  what am I saying? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5316.76s)]
*  I'm saying I want you extinct. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5318.12s)]
*  Do you know the first recipient of the Margaret Sanger Award? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5319.64s)]
*  No. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5322.28s)]
*  Martin Luther King, 1966. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5323.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5327.16s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5329.0s)]
*  Margaret Sanger was not a friend to the community, as we say. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5329.72s)]
*  Planned Parenthood and the Negro Project. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5332.92s)]
*  She called us human weeds. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5337.4s)]
*  She said, more for the fit, less for the unfit. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5339.5599999999995s)]
*  She had a thing called the Negro Project [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5342.5199999999995s)]
*  where she wanted to exterminate the black community [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5344.04s)]
*  because we were human weeds, is what she was concerned. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5345.64s)]
*  And Martin Luther King, Jr. helped us set up abortion clinics [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5348.28s)]
*  and got the Margaret Sanger Award in 1966. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5351.32s)]
*  When I heard from people, oh, he didn't know what was going on. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5353.96s)]
*  They duped him. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5357.32s)]
*  I said, well, did the, well, they have it on display. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5357.96s)]
*  And it's something. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5360.04s)]
*  That's actually true. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5360.6s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5361.5599999999995s)]
*  And I said, well, have they given the award back yet? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5362.12s)]
*  The human weed award? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5366.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5367.4s)]
*  No one knows they haven't. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5367.96s)]
*  All right, then. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5369.0s)]
*  That means that they're proud of it [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5370.84s)]
*  because they still display it. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5372.2s)]
*  They still say, oh, we didn't know this. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5373.64s)]
*  Take this award back. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5374.84s)]
*  You know? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5377.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5378.360000000001s)]
*  Martin Luther King, Jr. was the first recipient [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5378.68s)]
*  of the Margaret Sanger Award in 1966. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5380.360000000001s)]
*  Did you know the King was excommunicated [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5382.28s)]
*  from the black church? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5383.64s)]
*  No. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5384.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5385.400000000001s)]
*  In 1961, he was going to take it over [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5385.64s)]
*  for the civil rights community. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5389.0s)]
*  They had this bishop out there, Bishop Jackson. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5390.84s)]
*  And Jackson said, no, the church was not supposed [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5393.16s)]
*  to be involved in politics. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5394.92s)]
*  If you want to be involved in politics, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5395.88s)]
*  go join NAACP. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5397.16s)]
*  Go join the Urban League. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5399.0s)]
*  But the church is supposed to get you prepared [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5400.360000000001s)]
*  to live forever in the presence of Jesus Christ. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5401.8s)]
*  We're in the ecclesiastical matters. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5404.120000000001s)]
*  We're not going to be marching. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5406.280000000001s)]
*  We're not going to be doing sent-ins. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5407.240000000001s)]
*  Well, King and his crew wanted to take over [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5408.200000000001s)]
*  the National Baptist Convention. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5411.240000000001s)]
*  They had been given their orders from Stanley Levinson [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5412.200000000001s)]
*  and the common term to do this. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5414.4400000000005s)]
*  So they had a plan. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5415.96s)]
*  Taylor Branch talks about this in his book. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5418.4400000000005s)]
*  And also, David Garrow talks about it. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5420.120000000001s)]
*  But if you just go onto the Progressive Baptist [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5422.200000000001s)]
*  National Convention website, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5424.52s)]
*  they'll tell you about it too. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5425.64s)]
*  They went to the convention in Kansas City, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5428.84s)]
*  the National Baptist Convention. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5430.76s)]
*  It was a 10 million member organization. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5432.04s)]
*  Almost all black people like they were Baptist. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5435.96s)]
*  And so the Baptist churches had this convention [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5438.4400000000005s)]
*  called the National Baptist Convention. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5440.6s)]
*  King and his boys were going to go there [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5442.76s)]
*  and they were going to force a vote on the floor. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5444.200000000001s)]
*  And King had a guy that he was going to put up. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5447.0s)]
*  He wanted him to be president. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5449.88s)]
*  And King was going to be his puppet master. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5451.56s)]
*  Okay? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5453.160000000001s)]
*  So they were going to force the vote. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5453.88s)]
*  And they had a plan to go on the floor [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5456.44s)]
*  and push their way through. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5458.759999999999s)]
*  And I don't know what this means, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5460.12s)]
*  but somehow another supposed to work and take the floor. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5461.16s)]
*  They did it. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5466.2s)]
*  And a fist fight breaks out. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5467.24s)]
*  Preachers in their fight. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5469.16s)]
*  One of the preachers got killed during the melee. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5471.719999999999s)]
*  This preacher happened to be Bishop Jackson's best friend. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5476.12s)]
*  Fractured his skull and he died. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5479.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5480.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5481.32s)]
*  At the convention. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5482.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5483.08s)]
*  They had to bring in SWAT team, the riot police. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5483.639999999999s)]
*  And the mayor, it got so bad that the mayor of Kansas City even came in. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5486.599999999999s)]
*  Told him to cut this mess out. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5490.44s)]
*  Why have I never heard this story before? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5491.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5493.0s)]
*  So King loses the vote. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5493.879999999999s)]
*  The preacher dies and Bishop Jackson holds King perfectly responsible for it. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5498.839999999999s)]
*  He extra communicates King from the Baptist Church. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5503.48s)]
*  Kicks him out. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5506.04s)]
*  So King gets smart and he wants people to still believe [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5508.2s)]
*  he's affiliated with the Baptist Church. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5512.919999999999s)]
*  So he starts his own religion, his own church. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5514.839999999999s)]
*  And it's called the Progressive National Baptist Convention. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5517.96s)]
*  That's the sect that Raphael Warnock belongs to. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5522.839999999999s)]
*  He was a member of Raphael Warnock from Georgia. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5527.48s)]
*  This is why Raphael is so progressive. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5529.4s)]
*  And so liberal when it comes to abortion and gay rights. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5532.599999999999s)]
*  Because that's what these guys do. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5534.599999999999s)]
*  They're an apostate group of weirdos, malcontents, and perverts. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5537.08s)]
*  And they started an apostasy in the black church. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5541.96s)]
*  So when black people saw Baptist in King's organization, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5544.52s)]
*  they thought he was still with the National Baptist Convention. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5548.92s)]
*  Well, I fell for it too. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5550.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5551.88s)]
*  I did too about two years ago. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5553.56s)]
*  I was doing research on Raphael Warnock. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5555.88s)]
*  And I saw he was with the PNBC. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5558.2s)]
*  That's what the hell is a PNBC. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5559.88s)]
*  So I looked it up. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5562.6s)]
*  And it said King started it. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5564.84s)]
*  Da da da. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5566.12s)]
*  And then I looked through the books in my library and I saw the Taylor's book. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5566.68s)]
*  And I saw that Taylor Branch had written about it and had done a chapter on it. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5571.0s)]
*  And he went into it in depth. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5574.2s)]
*  And I said, how much else do I not know? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5575.64s)]
*  And then I found out about the Margaret Sanger Award. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5580.28s)]
*  That's shocking to me. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5582.92s)]
*  And I'm saying, good God. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5583.96s)]
*  Then you find out that he plagiarized his doctorate dissertation at Boston U. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5585.88s)]
*  And the only reason why they didn't take it back is because they didn't want to be called racist. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5591.400000000001s)]
*  And then you come to find out he's not a Christian. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5597.16s)]
*  And I'm sitting here in my late 50s saying I'm a well-educated man. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5598.84s)]
*  My family is well-educated. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5604.92s)]
*  Doctors and lawyers, nobody, nobody knew it. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5608.92s)]
*  Nobody. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5613.24s)]
*  I mean, I have scholars in my family and I'm calling all of them. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5614.84s)]
*  Didn't know. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5618.2s)]
*  Didn't know. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5618.92s)]
*  And I'm still in the face of this. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5619.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5620.6s)]
*  This is one of the reasons I do what I do. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5622.52s)]
*  Because I know with information, people change their minds. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5624.6s)]
*  Because it changed everybody I gave it to. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5627.32s)]
*  And they were sitting there saying, oh, my God. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5629.08s)]
*  So I've done a podcast on it and people hear it. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5631.639999999999s)]
*  And I'm thinking I'm going to get cussed out. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5633.96s)]
*  This you know good. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5635.96s)]
*  You always say, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5636.92s)]
*  To a man. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5638.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5638.679999999999s)]
*  I didn't know. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5639.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5639.719999999999s)]
*  It explains a lot. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5640.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5640.92s)]
*  Now I understand. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5641.48s)]
*  And this is why what you do is so important. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5643.32s)]
*  You have this huge megaphone that people listen to. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5645.08s)]
*  And when you do this and give a person like me an opportunity to come on and say these things. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5648.12s)]
*  Man, it's effective. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5652.92s)]
*  Well, because I can't believe it. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5654.5199999999995s)]
*  It's effective. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5655.72s)]
*  Well, because I think I don't know the truth about almost anything. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5656.84s)]
*  But I do know that what I have been told is likely untrue in almost every category. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5660.6s)]
*  And I think people have arrived at that conclusion. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5666.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5670.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5670.92s)]
*  You see the results of it. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5671.240000000001s)]
*  They're more open minded. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5672.04s)]
*  They are. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5673.320000000001s)]
*  Well, so I would say this. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5673.88s)]
*  There's a lot about, I thought I knew a lot about civil rights history. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5675.64s)]
*  Because I learned about it every year at school. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5678.04s)]
*  But I do know that the fruits have not been what were promised at all. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5681.32s)]
*  It actually hasn't worked. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5686.28s)]
*  You're from around Memphis. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5688.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5689.16s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5689.639999999999s)]
*  I was talking to one of your sisters this morning who lives in Memphis. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5690.2s)]
*  And I live near Memphis 30 years ago in Little Rock, Arkansas. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5692.5199999999995s)]
*  And people would drive from Little Rock to Memphis for the weekend. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5697.08s)]
*  Like take your wife there for a fun weekend. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5699.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5701.32s)]
*  Stay at the Peabody Hotel. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5701.799999999999s)]
*  I was there. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5702.839999999999s)]
*  I'm with the College University of Memphis. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5703.5599999999995s)]
*  I was there. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5705.4s)]
*  Yeah, great. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5705.719999999999s)]
*  It was a cool town. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5706.12s)]
*  Yeah, great city. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5707.48s)]
*  And now, you know, it's the most dangerous city in the United States. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5708.5199999999995s)]
*  Or certainly one of them. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5711.96s)]
*  It's like in Freefall. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5712.919999999999s)]
*  So clearly, this isn't working. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5715.16s)]
*  They know it's not working. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5718.679999999999s)]
*  They have the same stats in front of them that we have, Tucker. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5719.799999999999s)]
*  But a Democratic party, heaven is an American hell. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5722.44s)]
*  I saw that great interview you did with President Buclaley. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5725.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, from El Salvador. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5729.719999999999s)]
*  Buclaley, yeah, good guy. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5730.919999999999s)]
*  And he talked about spiritual warfare. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5733.0s)]
*  That he recognized it as that. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5735.719999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5737.4s)]
*  That MS-13 was satanic and they were doing rituals. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5737.64s)]
*  Literally. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5741.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's literal satanic. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5741.4800000000005s)]
*  And he said that when they hit them, they killed 84 people in three days. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5743.0s)]
*  And he said, what did we do? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5747.0s)]
*  He said, we prayed. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5748.04s)]
*  That's right. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5749.0s)]
*  He said, and we prayed for wisdom. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5749.96s)]
*  And he said, and we knew we were in a spiritual war. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5752.4400000000005s)]
*  And then he said, a miracle happened. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5754.6s)]
*  And they shut all of that down. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5757.0s)]
*  And he said, and people in America were mad at us [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5758.52s)]
*  because they knew that we could do it here. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5760.52s)]
*  They could do it there. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5762.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5763.64s)]
*  And they don't want it done here because [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5764.6s)]
*  if people live a certain, it's like people going to a plantation owner and say, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5766.2s)]
*  hey, man, why don't you teach your slaves how to read? [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5769.8s)]
*  What? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5771.96s)]
*  Then they'll know they're slaves. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5774.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5776.36s)]
*  Harry Tubman said, I freed a thousand people out of freedom. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5776.76s)]
*  A thousand more if they'd just known they were slaves. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5779.16s)]
*  Out of freedom. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5782.04s)]
*  But I was telling you about how in the black church [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5784.2s)]
*  they were telling we were on the curse of Ham. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5785.96s)]
*  We were supposed to be where we are. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5788.12s)]
*  See, they- [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5791.24s)]
*  You've actually heard a preacher say that. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5792.36s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5794.12s)]
*  Yes, many. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5794.679999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5795.72s)]
*  They do the same thing now. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5797.0s)]
*  Talk about they walk around telling black people, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5798.12s)]
*  you know, your country hates you. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5800.360000000001s)]
*  White supremacy. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5802.360000000001s)]
*  White supremacy? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5803.88s)]
*  That the flip side of white supremacy is black inferiority. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5805.320000000001s)]
*  We must stop white supremacy. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5809.320000000001s)]
*  Well, that means black's inferior. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5811.08s)]
*  We have to ask for D-E-I-Y because we can't compete with you [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5814.6s)]
*  because you're so freaking good. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5817.160000000001s)]
*  We need government interference. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5819.96s)]
*  We need government to help us because I can't compete with the white man. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5822.12s)]
*  Alright, thank you very much. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5825.08s)]
*  I guess I am inferior then. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5826.84s)]
*  Because I say the stupidest thing I ever heard in my life [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5829.16s)]
*  was affirmative action and D-E-I. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5832.28s)]
*  Now think about this. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5834.68s)]
*  You're a black man, right? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5836.12s)]
*  You're saying businesses and the government are racist. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5837.4s)]
*  And everybody says, yeah. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5840.92s)]
*  What's your solution to this? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5843.24s)]
*  Let the businesses and the government go to the black community [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5845.16s)]
*  and decide these racist businesses and racist governments. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5847.64s)]
*  Go down to the black community and decide what black people they're going to elevate. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5850.36s)]
*  So you're going to let the racists decide what black people are going to be elevated. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5855.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5862.28s)]
*  Who you think they're going to pick Malcolm X or Sepp and Fetchett? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5864.5199999999995s)]
*  They don't want to end discrimination. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5868.92s)]
*  They want to control discrimination. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5870.28s)]
*  They want to have this program so they say, okay, you decide what black person gets what. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5873.0s)]
*  And they get all their cronies. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5877.48s)]
*  And that's what's happened for the last 50, 60 years. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5878.6s)]
*  If you want to see the contempt the Democratic Party has for black people, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5882.12s)]
*  turn on MSNBC and just look at Al Sharpton and Joy Reid. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5886.84s)]
*  Look like a damn fool. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5892.76s)]
*  She got Trump hair. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5895.0s)]
*  She hate Donald Trump and got Trump's hair on her head. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5896.76s)]
*  Is she taken seriously? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5901.32s)]
*  By some, obviously, because they keep her on. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5903.4s)]
*  Al Sharpton still press his hair like you like and the conk left the black community. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5906.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5911.48s)]
*  The conk left when David Ruffin left the Temptations back in 1967. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5912.04s)]
*  It's an old school look, I will say. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5916.44s)]
*  Look like a fool. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5918.28s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5919.96s)]
*  That's how they see us. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5920.44s)]
*  Y'all the word was out that Al Sharpton was a drug dealer back in the day. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5922.6s)]
*  What's the mafia guy you had on your show? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5926.12s)]
*  The who? [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5929.88s)]
*  The mafia guy, ex-mafia guy. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5930.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, what a great guy. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5932.28s)]
*  Oh, God, that guy is awesome. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5933.16s)]
*  Oh, gosh. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5934.6s)]
*  I caught me. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5935.16s)]
*  I caught me. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5935.72s)]
*  I caught you with him the other day. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5936.2s)]
*  He's awesome. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5937.72s)]
*  He's awesome. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5938.36s)]
*  And he came out on real sports with Brian Gumbel. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5938.84s)]
*  And told the Al Sharpton story. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5942.28s)]
*  Said that, you know, Al was and then Al had to come out and admit to it. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5944.44s)]
*  There he's a snitch. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5947.56s)]
*  Oh, he was an FBI snitch. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5949.16s)]
*  Yeah, out there selling drugs. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5950.28s)]
*  Now I heard that, you know, they wanted to end [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5952.5199999999995s)]
*  menthol cigarettes in the black community, right? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5956.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5958.28s)]
*  And Joe Biden pulled back on it because they started saying it might make black people mad at him [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5959.16s)]
*  and Joe don't want to lose any votes, right? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5963.56s)]
*  So let them die. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5964.84s)]
*  They said to save between 300, 600,000 lives in the next few years. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5966.04s)]
*  Joe said, I'm gonna lose some votes. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5969.32s)]
*  He said, let them die. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5970.28s)]
*  Votes. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5973.0s)]
*  Why am I laughing? [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5973.32s)]
*  It's so gross. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5974.28s)]
*  Hell, let them die. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5975.16s)]
*  They're just black people. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5976.12s)]
*  Let them die. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5976.92s)]
*  So I smelled a rat, right? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5978.04s)]
*  I turned Joe Biden's away from this. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5981.0s)]
*  I said, I think I got a pretty good idea. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5984.04s)]
*  So I smelled a rat and I put that rat's name in and put in menthol cigarettes. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5986.5199999999995s)]
*  And Al Sharpton showed up. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5989.88s)]
*  I said, what? [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5991.56s)]
*  I'm gonna get him. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5992.12s)]
*  Haven't this clown done enough? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5996.28s)]
*  So the cigarette manufacturer called Al up. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=5998.36s)]
*  And said, Al, we're gonna give you some money to go down into the black community and [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6002.2s)]
*  put some heat on Joe Biden, right? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6007.48s)]
*  To keep him from burning these menthol cigarettes because we're getting paid, you know? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6008.76s)]
*  And so Al was trying to be slick. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6013.08s)]
*  He didn't want to go against the NAACP. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6014.5199999999995s)]
*  So he decided to corrupt George Floyd's brother and Harry Gardner's mother. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6016.36s)]
*  And had him go down there and talk for him. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6021.08s)]
*  So he even had to be on the front pages behind. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6023.24s)]
*  Wait, George Floyd's brother is a menthol cigarette lobbyist? [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6025.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6028.76s)]
*  He's working for Newport now? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6029.24s)]
*  He's working for Al Sharpton and Al paid him under the table, I guess. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6030.44s)]
*  And Harry Gardner's mother, he sent them down to talk for the menthol cigarettes to stay in [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6034.679999999999s)]
*  the black community. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6039.799999999999s)]
*  And then they started putting the heat on on Joe Biden. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6040.839999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden pulled it back because they said it might cause him some votes. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6042.759999999999s)]
*  So George said, let them die. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6045.5599999999995s)]
*  They've taken all other flavored cigarettes out that the white people smoke. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6048.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6052.839999999999s)]
*  But when it comes to black people, the menthol makes the nicotine more addictive, right? [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6053.32s)]
*  And everybody knows this, okay? [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6057.4s)]
*  And for some reason, when they were addicting the communities to cigarettes back in the [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6059.32s)]
*  40s and 50s, they were just giving them away. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6064.12s)]
*  They were giving the menthol cigarettes away in the black community. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6066.76s)]
*  For sure. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6069.96s)]
*  And so black people were smoking them. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6070.44s)]
*  I always wondered why black people smoke certain brands, Cools, Newports. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6072.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6075.639999999999s)]
*  But they were giving them away. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6075.88s)]
*  And the father- [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6077.16s)]
*  Was that true when you were a kid too? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6077.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6079.16s)]
*  My father didn't smoke. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6079.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6080.76s)]
*  He never smoked. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6081.4s)]
*  My mom didn't smoke. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6082.2s)]
*  So I didn't smoke. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6083.0s)]
*  So I would see my uncles and black men. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6084.5199999999995s)]
*  Everybody smoked except my dad and my mom. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6087.4s)]
*  And I always kind of wondered why they smoked the same brand. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6089.5599999999995s)]
*  I never saw white people smoking them. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6093.8s)]
*  No, they're nasty cigarettes. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6095.16s)]
*  Yeah, I've never. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6097.0s)]
*  And so I'm hearing- [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6097.8s)]
*  So I hadn't thought about it at all till I read this story about Biden pulling back [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6100.76s)]
*  the ban on menthol cigarettes. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6106.2s)]
*  And I said, there's got to be something behind. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6107.5599999999995s)]
*  This is always for all the money, right? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6109.0s)]
*  Well, of course. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6110.5199999999995s)]
*  And there stood Al Sharpton. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6111.88s)]
*  I said, boy, now you're killing black people with menthol cigarettes. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6113.32s)]
*  300, 600,000 black lives. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6116.679999999999s)]
*  I guess black lives don't matter when it comes to menthol cigarettes. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6119.32s)]
*  So they gave Al a little money. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6125.72s)]
*  And somebody said, you know, Al, if you take this money, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6128.12s)]
*  600,000 black people are going to die. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6132.2s)]
*  He said, and? [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6133.88s)]
*  How much money am I getting? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6139.08s)]
*  But it is. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6140.52s)]
*  I think you're absolutely right. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6141.16s)]
*  I never thought of it this way. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6142.92s)]
*  Well, I guess because I'm not black, but it's an expression of contempt. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6144.04s)]
*  Exactly what that is. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6147.32s)]
*  Oh, idiots. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6148.28s)]
*  Here are your spokesmen. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6149.48s)]
*  Here are your leaders, Joy Reid and Al Sharpton. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6150.44s)]
*  You obviously don't think much of me. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6152.92s)]
*  Tucker, you and I both know black people that are much more qualified, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6154.28s)]
*  much better at what they do. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6158.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6159.8s)]
*  I do. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6160.44s)]
*  Well-spoken, better looking. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6161.88s)]
*  I can understand how Joe Biden looked at Al Sharpton [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6164.28s)]
*  and thought that black people weren't clean. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6166.44s)]
*  OK. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6167.639999999999s)]
*  Look at it, right? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6171.16s)]
*  So, you know, you look at these people that they choose. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6172.36s)]
*  The DEI hires, right? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6179.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6181.08s)]
*  They're on our committee. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6181.24s)]
*  Jim Clyburn, Maxine Waters. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6181.96s)]
*  Bunch of idiots. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6185.32s)]
*  I mean, if you ever get the opportunity to sit down [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6187.08s)]
*  and have a conversation with them, you're going to walk away saying, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6189.16s)]
*  oh my God, black people are doomed. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6192.44s)]
*  These people are absolutely moronic. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6195.24s)]
*  And they are leading the black community. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6199.48s)]
*  And they are the stupidest people walking the face of this earth, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6202.04s)]
*  from Sharpton to Jackson, to Clyburn, to Maxine Waters. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6206.12s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6212.28s)]
*  And, you know, I'm warning black people about them [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6213.4s)]
*  because you asked the question. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6217.72s)]
*  I mean, I tell them, look at where they rule. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6218.92s)]
*  They're all kings over ghettos, standing on their ashes, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6221.24s)]
*  playing the fiddle, drugs, fighting, dope, terrible schools. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6225.72s)]
*  Family breaking down, graffiti. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6232.12s)]
*  Man, you wouldn't let your dog live in the places these people live, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6234.92s)]
*  in Detroit and Chicago and New York. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6237.56s)]
*  And they are there. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6240.2s)]
*  And then what happens when they run for office, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6241.400000000001s)]
*  there's no opposition because nobody won't even, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6243.400000000001s)]
*  Republicans don't even show up down there. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6245.64s)]
*  No, it's true. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6247.16s)]
*  They don't even show up. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6247.8s)]
*  There's no opposition anymore in Chicago [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6248.68s)]
*  and in these black majority districts. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6250.68s)]
*  None. None. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6252.2s)]
*  So these people are left to be smitten and beaten down and destroyed [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6254.2s)]
*  in a one-party system. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6260.5199999999995s)]
*  This is why I say, as Taylor Brand said in his book, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6262.679999999999s)]
*  that in 1956, the communists in America were given instructions [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6266.28s)]
*  to turn the black community into a direct opulence of the Soviet block. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6269.48s)]
*  And they've done it. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6274.04s)]
*  One-party rule, dictatorial worship, apostate religion, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6275.48s)]
*  poverty, drug abuse, government dependency. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6279.16s)]
*  It's a third world country and a first world country. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6285.32s)]
*  The black community needs something like Haiti. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6287.96s)]
*  A worse. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6290.599999999999s)]
*  And it started out with Martin Luther King Jr. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6292.919999999999s)]
*  whose whole life was a ditty party. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6294.679999999999s)]
*  Oranges and smoking and fighting and whipping up on women. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6298.36s)]
*  Martin Luther King Jr. make a ditty party look like a Kauffman Convent School. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6302.839999999999s)]
*  Just show they not your ass. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6310.759999999999s)]
*  He was smoking a menthol cigarette when he was killed. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6313.32s)]
*  Yes, he sure was. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6315.32s)]
*  He was smoking a menthol cigarette with a gunshot. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6316.36s)]
*  Been fighting and beating up women the night before. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6318.759999999999s)]
*  And drinking and. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6321.24s)]
*  It's just it's interesting. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6324.12s)]
*  Has to even say out loud, but you're just from such a different. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6326.839999999999s)]
*  I can see why you're mad about this because you're just from a different world. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6329.879999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6332.679999999999s)]
*  And the world you grew up in was not collapsed or pathetic. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6333.4s)]
*  It sounds like no, no, there's a. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6336.04s)]
*  There's always a penalty for lying to the strong. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6340.12s)]
*  Some people you can lie to and say, well, you're not doing the wrong joke. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6343.08s)]
*  You don't have to pay for it. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6346.52s)]
*  I'm one of those type of guys. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6348.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6350.040000000001s)]
*  See, I was taught up to revere these people. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6351.0s)]
*  Martin Luther King Jr.'s picture is still in my daddy's house right now. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6354.360000000001s)]
*  Revere them. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6357.96s)]
*  What they said was right. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6359.320000000001s)]
*  It was canon. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6360.120000000001s)]
*  And then when you when you're searching it, it's almost like when C.S. Lewis [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6362.6s)]
*  was talking to Tolkien and Tolkien was trying to tell you know, [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6366.4400000000005s)]
*  C.S. Lewis was an atheist and Tolkien believed in God and you know, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6369.4800000000005s)]
*  I would have loved and there's a book how these two brainiacs discussed this, right? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6373.0s)]
*  Tolkien and C.S. Lewis walking around Cambridge discussing this [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6376.52s)]
*  and Tolkien finally at C.S. Lewis with absolute fact. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6379.56s)]
*  He said Jesus Christ was either a maniac. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6381.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6384.92s)]
*  Oh, he's exactly who he said he was. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6385.8s)]
*  There's no middle ground here. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6387.080000000001s)]
*  Now you got to decide and Lewis looked at all the evidence. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6388.92s)]
*  He said, man, one crazy. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6391.96s)]
*  He had to be who he said he was and he said he had to deal with it. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6394.76s)]
*  He went through a convulsion. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6397.72s)]
*  And after that, you know, C.S. Lewis became the greatest Christian apologist [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6401.0s)]
*  of the 20th century. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6404.120000000001s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6405.0s)]
*  Learned so much from him from his writings and he died on the same day that JFK died. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6406.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6409.88s)]
*  And I'm reading his works and they've led me to great places. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6410.84s)]
*  Hell is the choice, right? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6414.280000000001s)]
*  Pride, the most damnable sin. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6415.72s)]
*  We were brought up. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6416.92s)]
*  Black pride, black pride. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6417.400000000001s)]
*  I said, whoa, pride's a damnable sin. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6418.360000000001s)]
*  I don't even use the word anymore. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6420.92s)]
*  I tell my children, I'm pleased with them. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6422.4400000000005s)]
*  What did Jesus, what did God say to Jesus, my other son, I'm well pleased. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6424.120000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6427.320000000001s)]
*  We don't use pride now, so we use esteem. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6427.88s)]
*  I'm esteemed. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6430.76s)]
*  I aspire. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6432.4400000000005s)]
*  I tell my children, I'm well pleased with you. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6433.56s)]
*  Because pride is something God hates. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6435.8s)]
*  And what if the left, they made it a virtue. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6437.8s)]
*  And children are dying because of pride. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6440.92s)]
*  That's why they pull their pants down. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6442.4400000000005s)]
*  Pride. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6443.8s)]
*  You're offending me. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6445.0s)]

*  What does a humble person do? [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6448.120000000001s)]
*  They walk in and say, I don't want to do anything to offend you, sir. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6449.400000000001s)]
*  Exactly right. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6451.96s)]
*  So tell me the rules here and I'll abide. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6453.0s)]
*  Because I'm putting your needs, your feelings above mine. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6454.4400000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6457.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, not the left. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6458.280000000001s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6460.360000000001s)]

*  What did they say? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6462.280000000001s)]
*  Me, me, my truth. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6462.84s)]
*  Me, me, me. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6463.72s)]
*  God hates that. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6465.56s)]
*  And they try to use it as a virtue. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6466.92s)]
*  Tolerance. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6469.64s)]
*  Tolerance is a sin. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6470.84s)]
*  Billy Graham did a great sermon on the sin of tolerance. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6473.0s)]
*  My next book coming out at the end of July is called The End of Tolerance. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6476.84s)]
*  Telling America, our tolerance has to end. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6482.4400000000005s)]
*  We have to become intolerant of these things. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6484.4400000000005s)]
*  And we can't be afraid to say that we are. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6486.280000000001s)]
*  No, no further. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6489.4800000000005s)]

*  You're not saying this to my child. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6491.64s)]
*  We're not allowing this any longer. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6493.96s)]

*  I'm not going to allow it. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6505.0s)]
*  You have to stand firm and say, I'm not going to allow it. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6508.04s)]
*  Tell your mother, I'm not going to allow you to feminize my son. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6510.6s)]
*  We have to start telling the court system, [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6515.320000000001s)]
*  you're going to start taking boys away from their fathers [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6516.6s)]

*  even though they might try, you know they don't have the ability to do it. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6521.72s)]
*  You know it. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6524.360000000001s)]
*  Why? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6525.4s)]
*  Well, that's about 60 years of empirical evidence to show that to be true. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6526.12s)]
*  We have to start putting together a society again [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6531.639999999999s)]
*  where if you read this book, my brother gave it to me, [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6535.719999999999s)]
*  about the governor of Maryland Westmore, the two Westmores. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6541.48s)]
*  I don't know if you've heard of Oprah. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6545.719999999999s)]
*  Oprah had it on her book club thing. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6547.16s)]
*  But it was a book about Westmore who became governor of Maryland, Black man. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6548.759999999999s)]
*  And another Westmore ended up in prison. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6552.759999999999s)]
*  And he talked about how their lives separate. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6554.84s)]
*  But the Westmore of Maryland said that they were both going in the same direction [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6557.8s)]
*  until his mother grabbed him. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6562.6s)]
*  He was smoking weed, wasn't doing well in school. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6564.28s)]
*  His mother wouldn't have borrowed money from Mary Batten and the family. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6566.6s)]
*  It took him to a military school to get out. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6568.76s)]
*  And they raised him and they gave him discipline. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6572.68s)]
*  He ended up going to Oxford. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6575.56s)]
*  They know this works. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6578.360000000001s)]
*  From Marvel Collins at Westside Prep to all these schools around here in America, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6579.96s)]
*  they know this works. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6586.44s)]
*  But you don't teach the slaves on your plantation to read. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6588.679999999999s)]
*  They will leave the plantation. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6593.639999999999s)]
*  This is why the GOP has to say, and I talked about this with a good friend of mine, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6596.599999999999s)]
*  Dave Brett down at Liberty University. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6600.92s)]
*  He used to be a congressman. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6602.2s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6603.24s)]
*  And Dave said, this is going to be Christian businessmen that do this. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6604.759999999999s)]
*  It's not going to be the churches. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6607.16s)]
*  It's not going to be the politicians. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6608.84s)]
*  It's going to be people like me and you, Tucker, like you're doing your job. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6610.599999999999s)]
*  You do it every day and I applaud you for it. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6613.32s)]
*  That says I'm my brother's keeper. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6615.0s)]
*  If that man, if that child is a Christian, he's my brother. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6618.12s)]
*  And I'm obligated to assist them. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6621.24s)]
*  Why? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6624.44s)]
*  He's my brother. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6624.92s)]
*  You and I talked about brothers, right? [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6625.4s)]
*  That's right. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6626.679999999999s)]
*  Brothers stand together. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6626.92s)]
*  He's my brother. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6628.04s)]
*  And therefore, we are obligated once we get to a point in life to say, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6629.72s)]
*  we got to go back and get some. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6632.44s)]
*  We got to go back and get some. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6633.16s)]
*  We have to. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6635.0s)]
*  And we have to start doing like, and we sometimes get trapped in what liberals do. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6636.52s)]
*  Let's use government. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6640.280000000001s)]
*  Let's go to government. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6642.280000000001s)]
*  Let's go to government. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6643.160000000001s)]
*  So why would we have to go to government? [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6644.200000000001s)]
*  When we are captains of industry, we have millions of dollars. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6646.4400000000005s)]
*  When we just do it ourselves, we can scholarships. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6649.88s)]
*  We can set up boarding schools. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6652.92s)]
*  We can get these really troubled. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6655.0s)]
*  Let's start at the troubled boys first. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6657.400000000001s)]
*  And let's go and say, Miss Jackson, your son is flunking out of school. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6660.360000000001s)]
*  He's in the second grade. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6664.68s)]
*  He's going to end up where his dad is, in prison and on dope. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6666.04s)]
*  We can take him and educate him and make a man out of him by the time he's 18. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6669.16s)]
*  And he'll take care of you for the rest of your life. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6672.4400000000005s)]
*  Can we have him? [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6675.08s)]
*  You can see him on the weekend. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6675.8s)]
*  She'll say, I'll take him. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6676.68s)]
*  Guarantee it. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6678.200000000001s)]
*  Guarantee it. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6680.360000000001s)]
*  That's what we must start doing. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6682.6s)]
*  And that's how we reconnect the chain by going and recognizing, [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6684.4400000000005s)]
*  because if the black community is corrected, [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6689.400000000001s)]
*  60% of the crime in America fades away. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6691.96s)]
*  The carjackins in D.C., Tucker, and in Memphis, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6696.76s)]
*  spent time by young black. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6700.04s)]
*  They're getting younger and younger. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6701.08s)]
*  Man, I read a story that hurt my heart. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6702.76s)]
*  It was a special needs guy in Washington, D.C. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6704.92s)]
*  He had two fingers on each hand. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6708.76s)]
*  I think it was in his 50s. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6711.08s)]
*  Him and this guy had gotten to it on the street about something, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6712.52s)]
*  argument fighting. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6714.92s)]
*  And it had ended. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6716.44s)]
*  And a group of five black girls under the age of 15s [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6718.52s)]
*  can we jump on him? [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6722.52s)]
*  He said, yeah, go do it. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6724.200000000001s)]
*  And they beat the guy to death. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6725.320000000001s)]
*  This was about maybe a month ago. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6728.84s)]
*  Beat him to death. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6730.84s)]
*  And you say, what type of society do we have now? [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6733.56s)]
*  Almost 20 juveniles have been killed in D.C. already this year, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6737.8s)]
*  under the age of 18. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6741.64s)]
*  Shot in the street. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6744.12s)]
*  And it happens all the time now where we're numb to it. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6745.64s)]
*  That's a way out. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6749.32s)]
*  We have to go back to our Christian virtue. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6751.8s)]
*  We have to go back to loving our neighbor as ourselves. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6753.72s)]
*  And like I said, we want Christian men to first love God [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6756.12s)]
*  with all your heart, your soul, and your mind. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6759.16s)]
*  Then you love your neighbor as yourself. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6761.96s)]
*  Because as we discussed before, unless you love God first [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6763.24s)]
*  with your heart, soul, and mind, you can't love yourself. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6765.48s)]
*  How do you love yourself unless you don't love God? [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6769.48s)]
*  Then when you love him and the peace of God comes over you, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6772.599999999999s)]
*  then you know how to love your neighbor. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6776.04s)]
*  And we're not talking about some idol like hip hop music love money. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6777.88s)]
*  That's your God, right? [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6782.68s)]
*  Well, if that's the case, what you're going to do to your neighbor, right? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6783.72s)]
*  We're going to sell them dope. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6785.8s)]
*  We're going to put them in the prostitution. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6786.52s)]
*  Why? Because that's my God. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6788.04s)]
*  I love my God as myself. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6788.92s)]
*  So we have to go back to our Christian standards. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6791.32s)]
*  Then we have to go back. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6794.84s)]
*  Then we take care of our families. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6795.96s)]
*  Then we go and we help our brothers and sisters in Christ. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6797.96s)]
*  And when Christian businessmen and women get together, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6801.400000000001s)]
*  and women get together and say, forget the GOP, a bunch of crook liars, sycophants. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6806.04s)]
*  We're going to do this ourselves. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6812.360000000001s)]
*  And you already know this, that charities, public charities always do better than government. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6813.88s)]
*  Always. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6818.52s)]
*  You know, the taxes are such a high rate though, [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6819.320000000001s)]
*  we can hardly use any of that money to send it to charity. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6820.76s)]
*  But that's what we have to do. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6823.64s)]
*  And we have to put out the alarm. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6826.28s)]
*  The stuff that you do, man, I don't know, you're here in Maine right now, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6827.8s)]
*  and you're kind of isolated like I am in the Blue Ridge mountains. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6831.24s)]
*  You don't know the effect you have. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6833.72s)]
*  On America. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6836.28s)]
*  I hope you know. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6837.96s)]
*  It is absolutely, positively tremendous. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6839.64s)]
*  On my way down, I always travel in a suit. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6842.12s)]
*  My dad taught me that. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6845.400000000001s)]
*  James Brown said, wherever you go, even if you're traveling, you got to strut, right? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6846.68s)]
*  So I'm coming down and say, hey, man, what's up? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6852.68s)]
*  I said, I'm going to do an interview. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6854.92s)]
*  Everybody knows your name. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6856.12s)]
*  It wasn't a person that I talked to. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6858.2s)]
*  I flew from Richmond. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6860.84s)]
*  Had to go to Atlanta. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6866.76s)]
*  So I went 500 miles south for some reason and come back. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6867.72s)]
*  Went to Atlanta and then flew from Atlanta up here. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6871.48s)]
*  And everybody that stopped me and talked to me, and I told them I was going, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6873.88s)]
*  everybody knew who you were. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6876.5199999999995s)]
*  Black, white, Asian didn't matter. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6878.36s)]
*  Everybody knew Tucker Carlson. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6880.92s)]
*  And everybody said, oh man, he's great. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6883.4s)]
*  And I'm looking at, I mean, everybody. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6886.599999999999s)]
*  Love Tucker. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6888.44s)]
*  Love. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6889.799999999999s)]
*  Tell them I said hi. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6890.679999999999s)]
*  I can't wait. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6891.4s)]
*  Oh, you're making me feel like I should leave my house once in a while. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6892.28s)]
*  Look, in Lynchburg, everywhere I went, when I would tell people, [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6896.12s)]
*  people say, oh Vince, what do you do? [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6899.4s)]
*  I was going to talk, you know, this is Tucker. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6901.719999999999s)]
*  And then they leaned in. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6904.44s)]
*  And it's never been a person I've met ever at the gym, at the grocery store, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6905.5599999999995s)]
*  at church, on the street. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6911.16s)]
*  And when I mentioned your name, they do not know who you are. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6912.919999999999s)]
*  Well, you haven't met, obviously, a lot of unmarried 45 year old white female lawyers. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6915.88s)]
*  I'm trying to have my fan. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6920.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, take a break. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6923.0s)]
*  Hit the men's room. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6923.64s)]
*  This is incredible. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6927.8s)]
*  Oh man, I'm having fun. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6928.76s)]
*  I'm having fun, man. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6930.2s)]
*  I would say a couple of, I know Sharpton very well. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6931.96s)]
*  And a couple of things I would say. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6933.96s)]
*  Well, I remember you said you went to Liberia with him or? [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6935.32s)]
*  Yep. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6937.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6937.64s)]
*  He's, he's not stupid. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6939.24s)]
*  Oh no, he's not dumb at all. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6941.24s)]
*  No, no. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6942.52s)]
*  He's one of the very few public figures who's actually smarter than he looks. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6944.12s)]
*  I quoted you in my book when you said Al Sharpton wants to be president of Black America. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6948.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's all he cares about. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6952.759999999999s)]
*  And see, and I said, I thought he was supposed to be a preacher. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6953.96s)]
*  No, I know. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6956.5199999999995s)]
*  Whose job is to bring people to Jesus Christ. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6957.16s)]
*  No, I know, I know. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6959.639999999999s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6960.04s)]
*  Why are you involved in politics if you, I mean, you're a preacher, why are you involved? [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6960.679999999999s)]
*  You know what he was? [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6964.679999999999s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6965.48s)]
*  He was, I mean, look, you know, all of us make decisions. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6966.28s)]
*  You know, freely, the big decisions freely, like there are faults, of course, I'm not [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6973.4s)]
*  giving you a pass on it, but Sharpton grew up a performer in the church. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6976.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was preaching at three, four years old. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6982.2s)]
*  Exactly, at four. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6983.5599999999995s)]
*  And his mom sent him around, his father had an affair with his mother's daughter from [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6984.92s)]
*  a first marriage with his stepdaughter and ran off. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6991.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6993.4s)]
*  And, but she put Sharpton out on the road at like four, boy preacher, Al Sharpton. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6994.04s)]
*  He went on the road with like Mahalia, well, Mahalia Jackson, I think. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=6998.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7002.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7002.599999999999s)]
*  And I'm preaching and so he grew up in a really distorted way. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7003.8s)]
*  I think that's part of it. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7007.96s)]
*  Well, that's what's happened with the black church. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7009.08s)]
*  It's turned Christianity into entertainment. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7011.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7015.08s)]
*  And it doesn't need to do that. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7015.88s)]
*  It really doesn't. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7018.84s)]
*  The word is enough. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7020.04s)]
*  If you want to see yourself a good singer, just give them a box of guitar and listen [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7021.8s)]
*  to them, right? [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7024.52s)]
*  That's why I love James Taylor. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7025.08s)]
*  James Taylor can just sit down with an acoustic guitar. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7026.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7029.24s)]
*  You just, wow, James Taylor's great. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7029.96s)]
*  Tracy Chapman can do the same. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7031.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7032.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7033.400000000001s)]
*  But Hale Jackson could just have a piano. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7033.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7035.72s)]
*  And could rock auditorium. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7036.12s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7037.8s)]
*  Those are, but when you got, you know, Kiss needed to have explosions and [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7038.68s)]
*  Makeup. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7043.400000000001s)]
*  Makeup and stacks that high, you know, because they couldn't sing. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7043.96s)]
*  So they needed to entertain. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7048.6s)]
*  And when you have preachers that don't know the word, they go into entertainment. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7050.52s)]
*  Do you preach ever? [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7056.68s)]
*  No, man, I take preaching much less. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7057.96s)]
*  Everybody has a vision to preach the same. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7059.320000000001s)]
*  Unless Jesus Christ comes and sits beside me and tells me, I want you to go preach my word. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7060.84s)]
*  I'm not going to say I'm speaking for him. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7066.84s)]
*  I'm more like a layman. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7068.92s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7069.88s)]
*  I take it from like C.S. Lewis, right? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7070.360000000001s)]
*  C.S. Lewis said, no, I didn't go to seminary. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7071.88s)]
*  I'm not a preacher. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7073.4800000000005s)]
*  I am a Christian. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7074.76s)]
*  I'm just explaining to you my relationship with Christ and how I see it. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7078.4400000000005s)]
*  I hope you agree. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7082.2s)]
*  And he changed the world. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7083.96s)]
*  We have people now and I don't know how it gets back right because as you know, through your history, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7085.56s)]

*  Their line really doesn't exist like it did back then because they were so apostate. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7097.64s)]
*  The Civil Rights Movement did that to the Black preacher. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7103.64s)]
*  It brought liberalism into the Black church when it had been very conservative [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7105.88s)]
*  and wasn't really into politics much at all. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7109.08s)]
*  Now it's getting very liberal in its teachings. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7113.24s)]
*  You have very few Black preachers that were preaching against LGBTQ or against abortion [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7116.28s)]
*  because the Democratic Party controls the preacher. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7121.24s)]
*  And we have two generations of Black people out there who have not really heard the truth. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7126.12s)]
*  And I think that's the problem. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7130.76s)]
*  I think that's the problem. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7132.28s)]

*  They will play Martin Luther King Jr. over and over again who doesn't really mention the name [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7139.24s)]
*  of Jesus unless it's in a parable. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7143.08s)]
*  You've never seen him baptize anybody. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7146.28s)]
*  You've never seen him ever alter call until people come to faith or bring him to Christ. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7148.759999999999s)]
*  Everything's about the vote. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7154.2s)]
*  Everything's about marching. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7155.799999999999s)]
*  Everything's about protesting. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7157.0s)]
*  And they see the church through that vein. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7158.919999999999s)]
*  And that is not its calling. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7161.639999999999s)]
*  No, that's corrupt. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7163.16s)]
*  And corrupting. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7164.679999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7165.639999999999s)]
*  And it's corrupted the Black community. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7166.36s)]
*  And it's corrupting the white community now because they're doing the same thing. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7168.04s)]
*  And people are believing in this. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7171.8s)]
*  If you want to get butts in the pews, this is what you do. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7174.28s)]
*  You start talking about social justice. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7177.88s)]
*  And C.S. Lewis in the school tape letters talked about social justice. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7179.5599999999995s)]
*  He said that we want to use Christianity to a means to an end, even to the end of social justice. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7182.2s)]
*  He said because the enemy, he called God the enemy because he was the devil. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7191.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7194.84s)]
*  He said because the enemy will not be used as a convenience. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7195.08s)]
*  And I said, wow. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7199.0s)]
*  And when I read it, it made me more angry because we've been told that social justice is a good [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7200.68s)]
*  thing. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7205.08s)]
*  But C.S. Lewis said God will not be used as a convenience. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7205.96s)]
*  And we try to use him as that. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7210.28s)]
*  Pay my light bill. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7212.44s)]
*  Pay my car bill. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7213.48s)]
*  Give me a house. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7214.6s)]
*  Give me a job. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7215.32s)]
*  Hell, a social worker can get you that. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7216.12s)]
*  Who can get you eternal life? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7218.92s)]
*  He's not your do-boy. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7221.24s)]
*  He's not your cosmic chauffeur. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7222.44s)]
*  And they have relegated him to that. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7226.2s)]
*  And he will not be used as a convenience. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7228.92s)]
*  And right now we're telling people this lie that if you join my church, he's going to [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7231.88s)]
*  bless you with a Cadillac. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7238.2s)]

*  He's going to bless you with that. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7240.76s)]
*  No, he'll make sure that you're in peace no matter where you are. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7241.72s)]
*  My father one time, it was this beautiful situation. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7245.240000000001s)]
*  It didn't start out that way, but it ended up great. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7248.84s)]
*  His 80th birthday, they were going to hold him a big birthday celebration. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7250.84s)]
*  And my sisters were setting it up, right? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7253.96s)]
*  And they hadn't got everything straight. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7255.96s)]
*  So we were at church. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7258.84s)]
*  They said, Vince, we don't have everything set up yet. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7259.64s)]
*  We need you to take daddy off somewhere and keep him occupied for about two hours. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7263.08s)]
*  I said, what do you want me to do with daddy for two hours? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7267.56s)]
*  I mean, you can't do anything. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7270.52s)]
*  Daddy's going to be in the church. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7271.56s)]

*  My sisters, they rule the rules. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7276.76s)]
*  I said, all right. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7278.12s)]
*  I just, dang. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7278.6s)]

*  Hey, daddy, come on. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7280.76s)]
*  Let's go somewhere because they want to be a surprise, right? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7281.400000000001s)]

*  OK, boy, let's go. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7285.64s)]
*  So I got him. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7286.6s)]
*  I put him in my car. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7287.16s)]
*  And I said, hey, daddy, show me where I was born, the place where I was born. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7288.12s)]
*  I was in Tennessee. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7293.0s)]
*  He said, I'll take you right to it. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7293.8s)]
*  So he and I got in the car and we drove. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7296.04s)]
*  He said, turn here. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7298.2s)]
*  He knew exactly where it was. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7298.84s)]

*  We believed in Santa Claus when we was five to six years old. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7408.12s)]
*  Right? [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7410.28s)]

*  Right? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7559.88s)]
*  The greatest percentage of black people who ever voted in a presidential election [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7562.2s)]

*  They needed him to have a victory. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7604.6s)]

*  Yeah, mostly black. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7769.96s)]
*  And those coaches were awesome. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7771.24s)]
*  Never at the school was there any stimulus of racism from the teachers. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7774.04s)]
*  None of that. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7777.08s)]
*  Was there racial tension at your school? [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7778.92s)]
*  No. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7780.36s)]
*  We went to school with white children and their friends of mine even to this day. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7781.24s)]
*  None. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7784.84s)]
*  Never had a white, black fight, riot. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7785.64s)]
*  Really? [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7788.200000000001s)]
*  Never. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7788.76s)]
*  What were the percentages, would you say? [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7789.320000000001s)]
*  I would say it's about 55, 45. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7790.92s)]
*  Seriously? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7793.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7794.200000000001s)]
*  And you never had- [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7794.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe 60, 40, black. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7795.240000000001s)]
*  And you never had racial tension? [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7797.64s)]
*  Never. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7799.0s)]
*  Not one time. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7800.200000000001s)]
*  So if you're 25 right now in 2024, you can't even imagine the world you're describing. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7801.320000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7808.200000000001s)]
*  No one under 50 has even come into contact with the world like the one you're describing. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7809.72s)]
*  History's going to tell them we were fighting, we were hating one another, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7816.84s)]
*  there was racial strife, the white people were treating us like we was dogs, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7819.240000000001s)]
*  we couldn't do anything, the government had to come in and save us. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7822.200000000001s)]
*  All of that. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7825.4800000000005s)]
*  And all of that is a lie. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7826.200000000001s)]
*  All of it is a lie. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7828.200000000001s)]
*  We saw people live and die based on their merit. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7831.08s)]
*  Some people did very, very well. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7834.12s)]
*  Some people did not. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7835.72s)]
*  And race really didn't have anything to do with it at all. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7836.68s)]
*  And you're talking about your life that you lived. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7840.4400000000005s)]
*  You saw this with your own eyes. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7842.280000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7843.56s)]
*  And right now, it's the same thing now. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7844.04s)]
*  You know about my family intimately and you see how successful we've been. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7848.360000000001s)]
*  And as I tell people all the time- [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7851.96s)]
*  I'm not going to let this secret out, but yes, I do. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7853.320000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7855.0s)]
*  I am familiar with your family. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7855.400000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7856.280000000001s)]
*  That is true. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7856.76s)]
*  You're not exaggerating. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7857.320000000001s)]
*  No. And as I tell people all the time, you don't get much blacker than me, okay? [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7858.200000000001s)]
*  It ain't like you can walk past and mistake themselves for a white man, right? [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7863.08s)]
*  And so it's obvious that I'm black. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7869.96s)]
*  So they don't care? [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7873.4s)]
*  I'm black and what? [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7875.8s)]
*  What are you going to judge? [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7878.12s)]
*  I'm going to walk around some races and say, please boss, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7880.68s)]
*  don't judge me about the color of my skin. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7882.76s)]
*  No, if you don't like me, that's your problem. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7886.2s)]
*  You put your hands on me, you have another problem. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7888.68s)]
*  I'm going to love you. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7891.16s)]
*  I've been ordered by Christ to do so. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7892.76s)]
*  I'm going to love you. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7895.32s)]
*  I'm going to treat you right. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7896.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm not going to cheat you. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7897.32s)]
*  I'm not going to lie on you. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7898.2s)]
*  I'm not going to do anything. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7899.4s)]
*  But it ends with blatant disrespect or with you trying to harm me. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7901.72s)]
*  And most men understand that. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7907.48s)]
*  Yes. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7909.4s)]
*  And because of that, it never happens. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7909.8s)]
*  Never. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7912.68s)]
*  I travel all over this country. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7913.16s)]
*  I meet nothing but nice people. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7915.32s)]
*  I can't remember the last time I met a bad person. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7918.28s)]
*  I'm literally sitting here trying to think that I cannot think of it. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7920.84s)]
*  The last time I met a person that was just mean to me. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7923.0s)]
*  I can't come up with it. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7927.16s)]
*  I really cannot. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7929.4s)]
*  That's not the America that Joe Biden describes. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7930.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7932.76s)]
*  Isn't it something? [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7933.16s)]
*  I don't know where that... [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7934.12s)]
*  Well, he's around Democrats, you know, so they probably that way. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7934.92s)]
*  But the rank and file American that I run into every day, and again, like you, I travel a lot. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7938.12s)]
*  And I run into people and I know people really know you. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7946.12s)]
*  They see Tucker Carlson, right? [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7948.52s)]
*  And they come up to me and I bet they're nice. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7949.64s)]
*  Hey, Tucker, hey, man. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7950.92s)]
*  They are nice, actually. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7951.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7952.84s)]
*  And so they want us to hate one another. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7953.56s)]
*  They want us to look at one another and, you know, like Iago and Othello whispering in your ear, [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7957.64s)]
*  you know, whispering in your ear. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7964.84s)]
*  He's your enemy. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7966.200000000001s)]
*  You watch him. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7966.84s)]
*  He's your enemy. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7967.72s)]

*  You watch him. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7968.84s)]
*  Dude ain't done nothing to you. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7969.400000000001s)]
*  But, you know, they're whispering in your ear. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7972.040000000001s)]
*  He's out to get you, man. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7974.200000000001s)]
*  You need to watch him now. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7975.160000000001s)]
*  And when that's planted, paranoia sets in. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7976.76s)]
*  And you have black people that are isolated in ghettos, right? [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7979.5599999999995s)]
*  Isolated. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7982.76s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7983.4s)]
*  That never come out. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7983.96s)]
*  And they've been fed this lie by the black preacher, the black politician, [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7985.16s)]
*  the black civil rights organizer. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7989.8s)]
*  And they won't let, if you want to talk about segregation, [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7991.32s)]
*  you try to integrate one of those majority black districts [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7994.599999999999s)]
*  and try to bring a patch of white people in there and see how they're going to fight you. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=7998.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you want to bring black people, I mean, you want to make [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8002.44s)]
*  a man bring in a tray of joes, right? [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8006.04s)]
*  Or whole foods. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8007.8s)]
*  You want to bring white people in here. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8009.08s)]
*  Uh-uh, get them things out of here. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8010.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, man, they'll try to burn it down. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8012.84s)]
*  They don't want white people in those areas because you're bringing alienating ideas to the [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8015.16s)]
*  to the locals. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8019.72s)]
*  No, they want to keep white America out of those black areas. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8021.48s)]
*  They call it gentrification. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8026.04s)]
*  It's just a fancy word saying keep white folks out. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8028.5199999999995s)]
*  And why do they want that? [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8031.48s)]
*  Because they want control. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8032.76s)]
*  Ralph Abernathy wrote in his book in the Walls, Cain's Humming Down, [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8034.04s)]
*  in the 1980 election, he went to them and said, look, guys, [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8038.76s)]
*  welfare is destroying the black family. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8041.96s)]
*  It's destroying it. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8043.72s)]
*  We've got three generations of black people on welfare. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8044.36s)]
*  We need to start doing something to get them off. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8046.76s)]
*  And he wrote this in his book. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8048.68s)]
*  I know we'll forget it. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8050.12s)]
*  He said, it pleased, he said something curious happened. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8051.0s)]
*  It pleased them to see three generations of black families on welfare [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8054.28s)]
*  because it gave them control. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8059.8s)]
*  And that's when he endorsed Ronald Reagan for president. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8061.96s)]
*  Ralph Abernathy endorsed Reagan in 1980. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8065.0s)]
*  How did I not know that? [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8068.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8069.88s)]
*  And that's why he did it because he said that the black caucus [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8070.2s)]
*  was trapping black people into this welfare trap. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8075.64s)]
*  And you remember when they did the welfare bill with Bill Clinton, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8079.88s)]
*  how the black caucus fought against it and they never voted for it ever. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8082.84s)]
*  They want to keep these people exactly where they are. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8087.24s)]
*  That's where their power comes from. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8090.36s)]
*  It has always been one of these attributes of black leadership [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8092.28s)]
*  that's very different than any other leadership in America. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8095.48s)]
*  Jewish leadership, Asian leadership, and the people in the Indian community, [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8098.759999999999s)]
*  look out for the benefit of their people, their trustees. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8103.0s)]
*  Black leadership has always been a sellout leadership [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8105.4s)]
*  that came from the plantation system and the house Negro system. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8107.5599999999995s)]
*  So when black people in the South finally got the right to do anything, [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8110.5199999999995s)]
*  they would go with their old slave masters [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8114.2s)]
*  and the slave masters had their outside children, their mulatto children, [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8116.44s)]
*  and they would put them in the power of the black community [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8119.4s)]
*  and they would give them the money to set up shop, to have money, to run for office. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8121.4s)]
*  And it was always this interconnection between them, [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8125.08s)]
*  them and the class of black people and the lower class black people [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8129.16s)]
*  that were under their control. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8134.2s)]
*  And it's that way still today. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8135.639999999999s)]
*  The preacher, the civic organizers, and the politicians, [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8137.639999999999s)]
*  they're all part of this little iron triangle [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8142.12s)]
*  where the rich white liberals in the Democratic Party give them money [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8145.5599999999995s)]
*  and they control the black community. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8148.679999999999s)]
*  And the Democratic Party is an apostate evil organization. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8150.68s)]
*  It is the evilest organization in the history of the world. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8153.96s)]
*  Nothing ever comes close. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8156.76s)]
*  The Nazis were here for about maybe 20 years. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8158.52s)]
*  The Democrats have been here for 220. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8160.92s)]
*  And they were the party of slavery from 1800 to 1860, [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8163.4800000000005s)]
*  the party of the Confederacy from 1860 to 1865, [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8166.280000000001s)]
*  the party of Jim Crow from 1865 to 1965, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8169.8s)]
*  wholesale murder, rape, torture, castration, they did it all for power. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8173.240000000001s)]
*  The Civil Rights Movement was necessitated behind [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8179.32s)]
*  the trustees of the Democrat Party down south. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8182.679999999999s)]
*  And none of them voted for any other civil rights legislation, [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8185.0s)]
*  maybe like one or two of them. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8188.12s)]
*  And do you think that after it passed that they changed or they're dying? [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8190.04s)]
*  Every senator that voted, every Democrat senator down south [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8194.52s)]
*  that voted against the Civil Rights Legislation of the 60s remained in office. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8197.32s)]
*  They never got beat. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8203.24s)]
*  Whether it was all over, whether it was lesser than Maddox, [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8204.84s)]
*  whether it was Eastman, whether it was Stennis, [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8206.84s)]
*  all of them kept their power. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8210.36s)]
*  And a lot of them started keeping their power with the black vote. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8211.64s)]
*  Because through Stockholm syndrome, [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8214.92s)]
*  black people were voting for the Democratic Party [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8216.44s)]
*  because they had taken on the characteristics of their masters. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8217.960000000001s)]
*  And they wanted to please him. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8221.48s)]
*  Wait, so guys who signed the Southern Manifesto, for example, [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8223.16s)]
*  opposed to civil rights legislation, [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8226.92s)]
*  they got reelected with majority black support? [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8228.84s)]
*  None of them lost their seats. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8231.0s)]
*  Black people got the right to vote down, [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8232.92s)]
*  started voting and massed down south. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8234.6s)]
*  Fritz Hollands left office. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8237.8s)]
*  Oh, man, God, Fritz left probably in the 2000s. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8240.84s)]
*  I knew him, so it wasn't that long ago. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8243.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and Fritz voted against it. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8245.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8247.24s)]
*  Fritz voted against it, Stennis, Eastman, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8247.56s)]
*  all of those old dixiecrats down there voted against it. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8252.04s)]
*  And none of them lost their offices, man. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8256.52s)]
*  Black people got the right to vote. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8258.04s)]
*  They voted for him. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8259.0s)]
*  Matter of fact, George Wallace, the worst of all of them, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8259.880000000001s)]
*  started winning with the black vote before he died. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8261.64s)]
*  Black people vote for George Wallace. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8264.76s)]
*  Hell, Jesse Jackson came and campaigned for him. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8266.04s)]
*  You're blowing my mind. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8269.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's how corrupted this is. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8270.6s)]
*  This is how intertwined it is. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8273.960000000001s)]
*  They've always been part of the same group [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8278.68s)]
*  and it's designed for one thing. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8280.6s)]
*  And this is why I always tell conservatives, [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8282.52s)]
*  the axis that this thing revolves on is the black community. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8285.960000000001s)]
*  This is why now, Tucker, from what you've been doing, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8289.960000000001s)]
*  about 30% of the black vote has left [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8293.640000000001s)]
*  the Democratic Party over the last year. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8296.44s)]
*  It started with our George Floyd interview [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8300.2s)]
*  and then black people started paying attention [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8302.44s)]
*  and now it's just, it's leaving. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8304.68s)]
*  And Joe Biden's in a panic. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8307.160000000002s)]
*  The Democrats are in a panic. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8309.800000000001s)]
*  This is catastrophic for them. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8311.0s)]
*  No Republican has gotten over 20% of the black vote. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8313.960000000001s)]
*  Nobody's gotten over 15%. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8316.68s)]
*  If Trump gets 20% of the black vote, [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8319.880000000001s)]
*  the Democratic Party's done forever. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8322.92s)]
*  Do you think he has a chance? [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8324.6s)]
*  Oh, I think he's got a chance to get more. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8325.64s)]
*  My next podcast coming out this Tuesday [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8330.199999999999s)]
*  is going to be Donald Trump, the true first black president. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8332.199999999999s)]
*  Because the Democrats have finally done to Donald Trump [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8337.56s)]
*  what they've been doing to black men for 200 years. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8339.96s)]
*  What they did to Donald Trump in New York [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8343.72s)]
*  is the Rodney King tape of the Democratic Party coming out, [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8345.4s)]
*  coming after white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8351.32s)]
*  Most coups start at the top. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8354.119999999999s)]
*  They don't start at the bottom. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8355.48s)]
*  We very seldom see a Mao Zedong coup [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8357.16s)]
*  where they fight for 20 years. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8358.92s)]
*  Usually they go and shoot them in the head. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8361.24s)]
*  They shoot them and then take over [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8363.08s)]
*  like they're doing in Africa right now. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8364.199999999999s)]
*  They go to the top and just kill them. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8365.24s)]
*  They're in charge. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8366.52s)]
*  That's what they try to do to Trump. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8367.8s)]
*  Trump is not just the leader of the Republican Party. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8369.24s)]
*  Trump is the leader of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8371.88s)]
*  who these people despise and hate. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8376.68s)]
*  They have an enemy that they're trying to kill. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8379.72s)]
*  And it is the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8383.8s)]
*  It's not that they dislike him. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8387.64s)]
*  The evangelicals, they despise them. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8389.72s)]
*  If you put that group and you talk about what they agree with [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8393.4s)]
*  and about what the Democrats and liberals agree with, [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8398.119999999999s)]
*  polar opposites, direct polar opposites. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8400.359999999999s)]
*  And they know that Trump is the leader of that crew, that crowd. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8403.88s)]
*  That crowd is his basis. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8407.8s)]
*  That crowd is where he gets all of his power. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8409.4s)]
*  And they know that if they take out Trump, [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8411.32s)]
*  who's going to take his place? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8412.76s)]
*  Who can walk up right now if Donald Trump is destroyed [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8414.68s)]
*  in the Republican Party and have that crowd come behind him [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8417.800000000001s)]
*  like they've come behind Trump? [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8420.84s)]
*  I don't think the person exists. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8422.12s)]
*  And they know that. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8423.32s)]
*  And so this was how the Democratic Party does it cool. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8424.84s)]
*  They don't use bullets. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8431.16s)]
*  They use the justice system. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8431.960000000001s)]
*  They locked up Manafort. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8434.52s)]
*  They locked up, they're trying to get Bannon now. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8436.12s)]
*  They locked up his, the trade guy with China, I forget his name. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8441.16s)]
*  Peter Navarro. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8444.92s)]
*  Yeah, Peter Navarro. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8445.640000000001s)]
*  They got Navarro locked up now. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8446.36s)]
*  Now they got Trump. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8448.44s)]
*  I mean, people don't see what this is. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8451.08s)]
*  What's the last time you saw somebody go to jail [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8453.800000000001s)]
*  for contempt of Congress? [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8455.320000000002s)]
*  How come Eric Holder's not in jail? [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8458.28s)]
*  Or Hunter Biden. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8460.28s)]
*  Yeah. Bannon's going to jail. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8461.320000000002s)]
*  I know. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8463.800000000001s)]
*  Navarro's in jail. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8464.52s)]
*  Trump's the first person in the history of the contrary [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8466.6s)]
*  to try it for what he tried him for. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8468.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, they coming. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8471.960000000001s)]
*  And what they're doing is shooting across the bow [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8473.72s)]
*  to see how we respond to it. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8475.32s)]
*  Because if we don't respond to it, [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8478.2s)]
*  they're going to keep doing it. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8479.56s)]
*  And right now the people are responding [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8481.8s)]
*  in a way that they didn't expect. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8483.48s)]
*  They see it. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8485.48s)]
*  What's the old poem? [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8487.32s)]
*  They came for the labor unionists? [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8489.48s)]
*  I said nothing. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8492.52s)]
*  Yeah, I said nothing. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8493.32s)]
*  And then they came for the soldiers. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8494.2s)]
*  I said something. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8495.64s)]
*  And then came for the Jews. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8496.12s)]
*  And I said nothing. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8497.08s)]
*  And then they came for me. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8497.64s)]
*  There's no one to speak for me. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8498.92s)]
*  And that's why you and I speaking out [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8500.92s)]
*  and telling people whether you like Trump [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8502.92s)]
*  or not is irrelevant at this time. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8504.52s)]
*  They're coming. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8506.12s)]
*  And they're not going to stop. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8507.72s)]
*  Because evil people and crazy people [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8509.56s)]
*  don't know how to stop. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8511.24s)]
*  They don't stop until everybody's dead. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8513.4s)]
*  If history tells us nothing, it tells us that. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8515.72s)]
*  Adolf Hitler went until Germany was destroyed. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8519.16s)]
*  Mussolini did the same. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8521.24s)]
*  The crazy Jogos in Japan did the same. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8523.16s)]
*  They kept going until the nation was destroyed. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8526.44s)]
*  These people have taken abortion from [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8529.640000000001s)]
*  Roe v. Wade all the way to nine month abortion. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8532.6s)]
*  Now they're in perinatal abortion. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8534.52s)]
*  You hear about that in California? [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8536.04s)]
*  No. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8538.36s)]
*  They're voting for an abortion bill [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8538.6s)]
*  that will kill a child 28 days after it's born. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8540.04s)]
*  Yes, it's in the house in California. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8545.16s)]
*  Perinatal. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8548.44s)]
*  After birth. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8549.640000000001s)]
*  Why? [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8553.4s)]
*  Because we, our argument was solid with them. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8553.8s)]
*  Well, when does life begin? [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8557.96s)]
*  We kind of kicking their butts. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8560.279999999999s)]
*  It begins at conception. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8561.4s)]
*  You're okay. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8562.519999999999s)]
*  Well, we can come up with three months. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8563.32s)]
*  What about one? [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8565.48s)]
*  What about five months? [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8566.199999999999s)]
*  Well, okay. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8567.48s)]
*  Okay, you're right. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8569.4s)]
*  We'll take it to the ninth month then. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8570.119999999999s)]
*  Well, if you can take the ninth month, why not after? [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8572.279999999999s)]
*  You're giving us the mission to do that. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8575.08s)]
*  You're giving us the mission to commit murder. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8577.16s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8580.039999999999s)]
*  It's logical, isn't it? [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8581.56s)]
*  Why not? [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8583.8s)]
*  Our logic is winning out, Tucker. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8586.039999999999s)]
*  And they're telling us, yes, you're right. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8588.119999999999s)]
*  We can kill them anytime we want to. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8590.119999999999s)]
*  The same thing with our logic when it came down [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8592.759999999998s)]
*  to homosexuality and all this kind of stuff. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8594.759999999998s)]
*  They say, oh, no, people born gay. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8596.759999999998s)]
*  But then they did the human genome project, right? [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8598.039999999999s)]
*  Didn't find no gay gene. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8600.199999999999s)]
*  They did the twin study. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8601.72s)]
*  And when one twin was gay, [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8603.72s)]
*  the other twin was gay only about maybe 20, 25% of the time. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8606.599999999999s)]
*  So it couldn't be in the DNA. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8609.72s)]
*  See what I'm talking about? [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8610.84s)]
*  So they start saying, no, what? [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8611.56s)]
*  No, it is a choice. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8612.76s)]
*  You're right. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8614.92s)]
*  But we've gotten the law passed now. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8616.12s)]
*  They're not trying to argue that any longer. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8618.92s)]
*  It's irrelevant. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8620.84s)]
*  The law's passed. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8621.48s)]
*  And right now, since states can now do whatever they want to do [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8623.56s)]
*  when it comes down to abortion, hell, I guess it's just [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8627.24s)]
*  a matter of legalisms, isn't it? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8630.76s)]
*  Like Dred Scott. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8631.960000000001s)]
*  Dred Scott is not a man that a white man need to adhere to. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8633.800000000001s)]
*  So you're telling us, so you've told us with abortion, [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8639.24s)]
*  and this has always been amazing to me, [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8641.24s)]
*  I remember when Scott Peterson killed his wife, Lacey. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8642.84s)]
*  Yes. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8645.4s)]
*  You remember he charged with two murders, isn't it? [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8645.800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8647.32s)]
*  How is that when the baby wasn't born yet? [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8648.44s)]
*  How is that? [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8653.880000000001s)]
*  Because everybody knows that. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8654.92s)]
*  Everybody knows. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8656.12s)]
*  That's a person, of course. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8656.84s)]
*  Everybody knows. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8658.68s)]
*  But we have said that the mother has a right to kill that child [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8660.44s)]
*  whenever she chooses. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8664.04s)]
*  So if it's a person here, it's a person. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8667.24s)]
*  It's a person here. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8669.640000000001s)]
*  They know it. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8671.4s)]
*  But we've allowed that legalism. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8673.56s)]
*  We've allowed it to stay. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8676.68s)]
*  And now we have to deal with it. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8678.6s)]
*  So, I mean, it's human sacrifice. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8680.84s)]
*  I think it's pretty obvious that this is a religious right. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8683.48s)]
*  Yes. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8686.12s)]
*  But at some point, you know, people are punished for killing, [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8687.720000000001s)]
*  for example, for sin. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8693.16s)]
*  Our nation's punished. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8695.800000000001s)]
*  I think they're all by God. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8697.720000000001s)]
*  And I don't think it's God punishing them. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8699.720000000001s)]
*  I think that what happens is he takes his hands off [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8701.24s)]
*  and you become a virtuous, a virtualist people [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8705.64s)]
*  and you start killing yourself. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8710.119999999999s)]
*  It was interesting, the commandment that says, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8713.0s)]
*  honor thy father and thy mother, so your days will be long on this earth. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8716.039999999999s)]
*  And people always think that that means that God will punish you [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8719.4s)]
*  for not obeying your father and your mother. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8722.199999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8725.48s)]
*  It is a harbinger. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8726.28s)]
*  It tells you the type of person that you are. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8728.28s)]
*  And my dad would say, if you do not honor and obey me, [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8731.0s)]
*  you won't honor and obey the police. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8734.12s)]
*  You will not, you'll go outside this house [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8735.800000000001s)]
*  and you'll disrespect the wrong person. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8737.400000000001s)]
*  And that wrong person is going to bust a cap in your head. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8739.320000000002s)]
*  So when you are disrespectful to your parents, [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8741.640000000001s)]
*  it tells the type of spirit you have in you, [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8743.720000000001s)]
*  an arrogant, prideful, disrespectful spirit. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8745.800000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8748.68s)]
*  And that's going to get you in trouble outside of the house. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8749.480000000001s)]
*  And the people outside of the house don't love you like your mom and daddy do. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8751.880000000001s)]
*  And somebody has to either lock you up or put you in jail or kill you. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8754.92s)]
*  That means you have no respect for yourself. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8757.800000000001s)]
*  So you're going to be doing dope and drugs. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8759.24s)]
*  You're going to be out there fighting and acting a fool. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8760.84s)]
*  So as a harbinger. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8763.16s)]
*  So when people kill their own children, [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8764.28s)]
*  you know, you tell them that you can kill them inside the womb. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8767.64s)]
*  Well, why do you? [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8769.8s)]
*  Well, that means you can kill them outside of it too. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8770.44s)]
*  So why do you think the murder rates are in the black community? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8773.0s)]
*  It's no virtue in life. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8775.56s)]
*  You told them you can kill them inside the womb. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8777.72s)]
*  So why can't I kill them outside the womb? [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8779.16s)]
*  So now we're killing one another. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8780.6s)]
*  And now the nation is dying. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8782.039999999999s)]
*  And when you don't have any respect for life, [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8783.56s)]
*  you have no respect for anything else. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8786.119999999999s)]
*  Because that's the most important thing. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8787.32s)]
*  Our Bible tells us, [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8790.44s)]
*  I lay before you, [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8794.119999999999s)]
*  blessings and curses, [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8795.08s)]
*  life and death. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8796.92s)]
*  Choose life so that you and your children shall live. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8798.68s)]
*  Choose life. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8804.279999999999s)]
*  We're choosing death. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8805.88s)]
*  Democratic law is a death cult. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8807.64s)]
*  They know what they're doing. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8810.039999999999s)]
*  You take away the rights of people keeping bare arms [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8811.72s)]
*  in a war zone. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8814.6s)]
*  Knowing that the police in Detroit is two hours away [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8815.56s)]
*  and the criminals know that. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8819.8s)]
*  You have people riding down the dangerous highways [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8823.0s)]
*  and tell them they can't be armed and everybody on [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8825.0s)]
*  and every crook on that highway knows that. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8826.92s)]
*  So they see your car broke down. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8828.44s)]
*  They know you don't have a gun [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8829.48s)]
*  and they can rob you. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8831.64s)]
*  Carjackers in DC, why? [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8833.48s)]
*  Because they can't carry a gun in their car. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8834.68s)]
*  Think criminals are stupid. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8837.0s)]
*  Why you think they carjack people in DC like that? [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8838.279999999999s)]
*  You can't carry a gun in your car in DC. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8840.76s)]
*  Because they're defenseless. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8842.279999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8843.24s)]
*  And who makes that happen? [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8843.72s)]
*  They know this. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8844.92s)]
*  What did Machiavelli said? [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8848.679999999998s)]
*  He said that there is no relationship between [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8849.64s)]
*  when there's no relationship between an armed [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8851.8s)]
*  and a disarmed man. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8853.4s)]
*  Armed man has all the power. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8855.64s)]
*  All of it. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8857.96s)]
*  And when you disarm a person, he's no longer free. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8859.24s)]
*  They know this. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8861.88s)]
*  This is why when the British came here [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8862.84s)]
*  and I was in Boston after the election in green [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8865.96s)]
*  where they confronted them and he said, [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8867.96s)]
*  call us, give up your arms. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8869.96s)]
*  They said, come take them. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8871.16s)]
*  They came to disarm them. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8872.04s)]
*  Because they knew that they could not subdue [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8874.04s)]
*  an armed population. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8877.480000000001s)]
*  They know once they get our guns, [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8879.240000000002s)]
*  we have to capitulate to what they say. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8880.52s)]
*  And wherever you find a large group of black people, [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8883.800000000001s)]
*  whether they do, take the guns away. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8887.880000000001s)]
*  Now, where did this start? [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8890.68s)]
*  Right at the end of the Civil War [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8891.720000000001s)]
*  where they wanted to make sure that the freedmen [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8893.640000000001s)]
*  could be subdued and controlled. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8895.160000000002s)]
*  So they put out black holes [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8896.44s)]
*  so that black men could not have guns. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8897.480000000001s)]
*  And so guess who you go out there [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8898.92s)]
*  to start preaching this foolishness? [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8900.28s)]
*  Black preacher, black politician, [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8902.76s)]
*  black civil rights leader. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8903.960000000001s)]
*  Remember those two young black men in Nashville [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8905.08s)]
*  who got kicked out of the house [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8907.56s)]
*  because they were protesting [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8909.72s)]
*  and they went, one in Memphis, one in Nashville. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8912.44s)]
*  And they got reelected. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8914.84s)]
*  But what were they protesting? [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8916.52s)]
*  Gun legislation. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8917.880000000001s)]
*  To allow people to be able to more freely have their guns. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8919.960000000001s)]
*  They were protesting that. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8922.76s)]
*  They didn't want guns in the black community. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8924.12s)]
*  They didn't want guns in the black community. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8925.960000000001s)]
*  With all the crime. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8928.199999999999s)]
*  So you got people out there screaming, [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8930.359999999999s)]
*  yeah, the police are racist. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8933.24s)]
*  The police are racist. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8934.119999999999s)]
*  The police are racist. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8935.0s)]
*  And they're hunting black men. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8935.88s)]
*  What is your remedy? [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8937.16s)]
*  Well, let's turn our guns over to them. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8938.199999999999s)]
*  I said, why don't you just be expeditious [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8939.8s)]
*  and blow your own damn brains out. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8941.64s)]
*  Just shoot yourself. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8944.119999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna give the police running after me, [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8945.88s)]
*  chasing me to kill me. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8948.199999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, wait. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8949.08s)]
*  I'll take my gun. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8950.039999999999s)]
*  What's going on? [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8950.919999999998s)]
*  So the cops are racist [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8952.919999999998s)]
*  and they should be the only people alive there. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8954.359999999999s)]
*  The only people alive that have firearms. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8956.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8958.44s)]
*  Whereas logically, if the cops are racist [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8958.68s)]
*  and they got firearms, [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8961.0s)]
*  you should have 10 guns on you. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8961.800000000001s)]
*  Because I know that this racist cop out there [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8965.640000000001s)]
*  trying to kill me. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8967.800000000001s)]
*  It's illogical. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8969.24s)]
*  It's stupid. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8970.36s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8971.08s)]
*  Government is like children. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8972.6s)]
*  They'll take as much power as you let them have. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8973.880000000001s)]
*  And you have to tell government no further. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8977.08s)]
*  Because we know you're gonna start intruding on our rights. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8979.560000000001s)]
*  And we're not gonna allow that. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8982.12s)]
*  How do we get you off of us? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8983.960000000001s)]
*  We will kill you. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8985.56s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8986.84s)]
*  Okay, no further. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8988.68s)]
*  All right then. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8989.56s)]
*  What did Jefferson said? [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8990.68s)]
*  He said the tree of liberty must be fertilized. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8992.119999999999s)]
*  What? [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8995.8s)]
*  With the blood of tyrants and patriots. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8996.119999999999s)]
*  It's their natural manure. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=8998.6s)]
*  You got to be willing to. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9001.24s)]
*  And this is where, you know, [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9003.0s)]
*  we've had this big problem in the black community. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9004.439999999999s)]

*  12 years. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9132.92s)]
*  Then in the election of 1876, [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9134.52s)]
*  Rutherford B. Hayes against Tilden. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9136.76s)]
*  The whole south goes Democrat. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9139.24s)]

*  they vote for a Democrat. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9154.84s)]
*  So they sit there and they find out that there was some, [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9157.56s)]
*  you know, kind of shenanigans behind the vote and everything, [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9159.4s)]
*  South Carolina had 101% of its registered voters vote. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9162.359999999999s)]
*  Which is a lot. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9164.839999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know? [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9165.96s)]

*  This was cheated. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9170.519999999999s)]
*  We're going to pull back the electoral vote college vote [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9171.16s)]
*  to South Carolina and give them the Hayes. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9173.32s)]
*  Anyway, South Carolina said, [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9174.839999999998s)]
*  we're going to start the civil war again if you do that. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9175.8s)]
*  So they sat down and said, you know what? [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9178.119999999999s)]
*  We fought the civil war for five years. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9181.96s)]
*  Probably in today's money, trillions of dollars. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9186.039999999999s)]
*  600,000 of our troops have been maimed or killed, [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9188.12s)]
*  freeing these slaves, these black folks down here. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9193.240000000002s)]
*  And they have reelected the Democratic Party [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9197.400000000001s)]
*  who had them enslaved. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9200.28s)]
*  If you want to be with your master, be with him. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9201.480000000001s)]
*  Peace out. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9205.480000000001s)]
*  And they pulled the troops out. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9207.080000000002s)]
*  And then they say what? [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9210.12s)]
*  We know the old refrain. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9211.320000000002s)]
*  White intimidation came in and subdued the black population. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9212.6s)]
*  And beat them down for years. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9217.48s)]
*  The races and wouldn't let them vote. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9219.16s)]
*  There were three times more black men [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9220.6s)]
*  than white men in South Carolina. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9222.2s)]
*  There were two times more in Mississippi. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9224.6s)]
*  It was half and half in Louisiana, in Alabama, [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9227.8s)]
*  in Georgia, and in Virginia. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9232.76s)]
*  At the beginning of the civil war, [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9236.28s)]
*  there were 4.5 million whites. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9237.56s)]
*  There were 4 million blacks. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9240.36s)]
*  They had about 400,000 white men that died in the civil war. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9242.44s)]
*  So by the time the war was over with, [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9246.52s)]
*  the best and the strongest of the South's men were dead. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9247.720000000001s)]
*  Or, you know, arm cut off, leg cut off. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9252.28s)]
*  And the black slave population stayed the same. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9255.560000000001s)]
*  And black men wouldn't fight. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9258.12s)]
*  Most wouldn't fight. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9260.12s)]
*  They wouldn't defend their families. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9262.04s)]
*  They wouldn't defend their property. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9264.04s)]
*  They were subjugated. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9265.960000000001s)]
*  And this is why I always tell people, [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9268.04s)]
*  they ain't getting mad at me. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9269.24s)]
*  I don't care. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9270.28s)]
*  Slavery, just like freedom, is a choice. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9271.720000000001s)]
*  Frederick Douglass was a slave. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9274.12s)]

*  He was 16 years old. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9281.960000000001s)]
*  The slave breaker's name was Covey. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9283.160000000002s)]
*  Frederick writes about him. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9285.0s)]
*  Just whooping Frederick and beating him. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9287.240000000002s)]
*  And Covey hit Frederick one too many times. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9289.08s)]
*  And Frederick beat the hell out of Covey. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9292.28s)]
*  Good for him. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9295.400000000001s)]
*  And Covey respected him. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9297.400000000001s)]
*  And Frederick Douglass said he found out he was a slave. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9299.720000000001s)]
*  And Frederick Douglass said he found out he said, [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9302.6s)]
*  he says, power gives up nothing without demand. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9305.160000000002s)]
*  He said, a weak man can never have power. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9308.36s)]
*  He said, he will be pitied for a time. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9311.240000000002s)]
*  But until the power rises up in him, [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9314.04s)]
*  he will never be respected. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9316.28s)]
*  And that's when Frederick Douglass became Frederick Douglass. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9318.04s)]
*  He left, got his freedom, and became who he was. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9320.28s)]

*  Well Tucker, there's a problem with that. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9441.64s)]
*  GDP with America is only like maybe $23, $20. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9444.359999999999s)]
*  It was all of them, everything America made last year. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9448.84s)]
*  You're not going to get it. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9452.119999999999s)]
*  And here's the greatest reason that you're not going to get it. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9455.4s)]
*  Barack Obama became president in 2000. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9460.199999999999s)]
*  He won in 2007, became president in 2008. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9464.279999999999s)]
*  You remember this well because he had a filibuster-approved majority [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9467.0s)]
*  in the House and the Senate. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9471.72s)]
*  Remember he had 58 Democrats and two independents caucusing with him. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9472.76s)]
*  That was filibuster-proof. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9477.0s)]
*  Their culture was dying. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9478.68s)]
*  And that's how they got Obamacare passed, right? [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9481.72s)]
*  That's Pelosi got it through the House and then they had the 60 votes in the Senate. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9484.12s)]
*  And you know how hard it is to get 60 votes for one party in the Senate. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9487.08s)]
*  I can remember the last time that ever happened. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9490.44s)]
*  Barack had it. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9493.08s)]
*  How many times did reparations come up? [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9494.04s)]
*  Approximately zero. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9496.2s)]
*  Approximately zero. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9497.24s)]
*  In that range. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9498.2s)]
*  Yes. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9499.0s)]
*  Never came up. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9499.880000000001s)]
*  Never came up. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9500.6s)]
*  Could have passed it easy, couldn't he? [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9503.24s)]
*  Never came up. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9506.68s)]
*  You will never get it. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9508.68s)]
*  It's Lucy moving the football, Charlie Brown. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9510.12s)]
*  It's the carrot in front of the old mule making him walk. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9513.4s)]
*  You will never ever get it. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9516.44s)]
*  And when I hear these people lying to these people that aren't very well educated, [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9518.92s)]
*  telling them about this. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9523.08s)]
*  What did the old crow in Alamofar flew around telling people about? [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9525.16s)]
*  All the things they were going to get. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9534.92s)]
*  What do you call it? [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9536.28s)]
*  Honey and all this kind of stuff. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9536.76s)]
*  You know, and the people were working believing it. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9538.52s)]
*  It's a communist. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9541.4s)]
*  It's part of what they do is how they work. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9544.84s)]
*  They give you these false idols to pray to. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9547.72s)]
*  You know, they have the statues of Lenin. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9551.32s)]
*  And Stalin all over the Soviet Union like they do King here in America, right? [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9555.32s)]
*  In the black community streets and stuff named after him [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9558.68s)]
*  to make people believe that his ideology was so correct. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9561.48s)]
*  And the guy wasn't apostate. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9564.6s)]
*  Everything he talked about failed. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9567.32s)]
*  So I guess my last question is you've laid out the case, I think, compellingly, [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9569.16s)]
*  that the Democratic Party has oppressed, [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9574.12s)]
*  well, the country, but black people in particular for a couple hundred years. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9576.84s)]
*  So what is the thinking of people who see you're saying you think [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9581.48s)]
*  the Republican this year could get over 20 percent, but that's still [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9585.640000000001s)]
*  it's still a lot of people voting Democrat. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9589.48s)]
*  It is. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9591.24s)]
*  It is. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9591.640000000001s)]
*  What? Why? [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9592.44s)]
*  Social pressure. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9594.6s)]
*  How intense is the social pressure? [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9596.84s)]
*  Oh, you can be ostracized. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9598.36s)]
*  Actually? [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9600.52s)]
*  Yeah, you have to you have to be able to explain yourself very, very well. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9601.0s)]
*  Black people that can explain themselves well, like I do. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9606.12s)]
*  I have no problem. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9610.52s)]
*  Well, why would you why are you against the Democratic Party? [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9611.880000000001s)]
*  You've seen myself. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9614.76s)]
*  They castrate little boys and call them little girls. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9615.32s)]
*  These people vote for candidates that say they're going to get legal [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9618.52s)]
*  for demented men to go into the bathroom and watch your wife and your daughter urinate. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9621.4s)]

*  But they have this ability to deflect [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9750.64s)]
*  because there's nobody to give the other side of the narrative. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9752.96s)]
*  That's what makes me so dangerous. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9755.92s)]

*  you're going to vote for a party that allows such a thing. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9803.12s)]

*  If you caught a man posted up watching women use the bathroom, hell, [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9811.6s)]
*  they put him in the crazy house. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9814.56s)]
*  Of course. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9815.76s)]
*  He'd be beaten by the dads. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9816.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9818.16s)]
*  And then the police will come and whoop him some more. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9818.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9820.72s)]

*  Now they'll whoop the dad. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9823.119999999999s)]
*  Put the dad in jail. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9825.84s)]
*  You better not say a word. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9828.4s)]
*  Let this man watch your wife and your child urinate. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9829.68s)]
*  And you have men to sit around and let that happen. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9834.32s)]
*  And you have men to sit around and let that happen. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9836.8s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9839.119999999999s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9839.92s)]
*  We're going to allow these people come in, men in dresses, [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9841.6s)]
*  and confuse your children like this. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9843.92s)]
*  The call is to them first. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9848.64s)]
*  Are you a man? [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9852.56s)]
*  Are you not? [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9853.68s)]
*  Now, you know, the ones that say they're not men, that's cool. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9854.48s)]
*  We're going to watch your wife. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9856.24s)]
*  But there are a lot of them that still consider themselves men. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9857.039999999999s)]
*  And those are the ones that you reach. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9860.72s)]
*  Because these black men are really making the turn. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9862.16s)]
*  They're not black women. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9865.44s)]
*  I've noticed. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9866.640000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9867.36s)]
*  Not black women, though. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9867.76s)]
*  No, the Democratic Party is their husband. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9868.880000000001s)]
*  Is that what that is? [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9871.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9872.560000000001s)]
*  Because I see the numbers and it's people say the black vote is changing. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9872.960000000001s)]
*  No, black men are changing. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9876.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, black men are changing big because- [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9878.16s)]
*  Do you see the same? [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9880.16s)]
*  Yes. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9880.960000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9881.28s)]
*  I agree. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9881.84s)]
*  There's no one in America more the cheese molding black men. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9883.2s)]
*  And you have to remind them of that. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9888.08s)]
*  And the black women are protected by government. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9890.24s)]
*  They can put restraining orders on men for anything. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9895.76s)]
*  They can take their children away and make them pay child support. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9897.92s)]
*  They take their sons away. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9900.640000000001s)]
*  That's the game that they play. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9902.08s)]
*  They use government to come in and try to castrate their husbands [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9903.68s)]
*  and try to castrate their boyfriends. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9908.960000000001s)]
*  And a man can say, I'll take my son. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9910.720000000001s)]
*  I'll raise him. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9912.720000000001s)]
*  I'll take care of him. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9913.28s)]
*  No, I'll keep him and I want you to pay me. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9914.0s)]
*  And the judges, nine times out of ten, will say, yeah, she's right. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9916.800000000001s)]
*  Pay her and let her raise her son. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9921.44s)]
*  And you can see him four times out of the month. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9922.880000000001s)]
*  And then these boys are raised confused. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9925.76s)]
*  But again, they know this. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9928.32s)]
*  What did Pharaoh say when he found out that the children of Israel [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9931.84s)]
*  were getting too numerous in Goshen? [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9936.4s)]
*  He went to the midwives and said, if you see a girl child, let them live. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9939.12s)]
*  If you see a boy child, kill him. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9944.32s)]
*  Kill him. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9948.16s)]
*  Kill the boy child. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9950.32s)]

*  There was a great book out that said, Conspiracy to Destroy Boys in America. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9956.4s)]
*  It was done about 20, 30 years ago. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9959.76s)]
*  They're warning people that this society has been set up from the feminists [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9961.359999999999s)]
*  and whatnot to take men out, to feminize men. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9964.24s)]
*  The LGBTQ movement, same thing. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9966.72s)]
*  Feminization of men. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9968.88s)]
*  Confusing them. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9970.64s)]
*  The Boy Scouts, look at what they've done. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9972.4s)]
*  Tucker? [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9973.92s)]
*  They're playing with them, calling them Boy Scouts any longer. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9975.44s)]
*  They didn't mess with the Girl Scouts, did they? [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9977.68s)]
*  We've got to take the Boy Scouts out. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9980.56s)]
*  The man is the problem. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9982.0s)]
*  Our Bible says, Jesus gave the parable that if a robber is going to come [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9983.52s)]
*  into a home, he first must bind the strong man. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9988.0s)]
*  He has to bind the strong man before. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9991.6s)]
*  But if he doesn't bind the strong man, the strong man will wait [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9993.44s)]
*  and will not allow his house to be shaken up. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=9996.72s)]
*  They have to bind the strong man, especially the American strong man. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10000.08s)]
*  The American strong man, it was something nobody had ever seen before. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10005.76s)]
*  He was something that the world had never witnessed before. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10008.88s)]
*  I mean, when the Americans came, it was over. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10012.48s)]
*  It was wilder walking in. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10015.679999999998s)]
*  It stops now. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10016.8s)]

*  He was concerned. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10127.199999999999s)]

*  He said, my father's dead. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10132.599999999999s)]
*  But that's the question, isn't it? [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10134.64s)]
*  What does your father say? [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10135.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10136.64s)]
*  He didn't tell him what to do. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10137.64s)]
*  He asked him, what does your father say? [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10138.64s)]
*  I always do that when a child, when someone young asks me about policy. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10141.64s)]
*  I said, what does your father say? [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10145.0s)]
*  And when he tells me, that's what you do. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10146.0s)]
*  And when you get, and if I disagree, I said, when you get to be 18 years old, look me up, [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10149.12s)]
*  we'll talk. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10152.12s)]
*  Right now you do what your father says. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10153.12s)]
*  All right? [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10154.12s)]
*  You don't want to, I don't want to go against his father. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10155.12s)]
*  That's right. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10158.56s)]
*  If I talk to his father, I talk to it, but I won't talk to the father's son without the [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10159.56s)]
*  father's permission. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10162.56s)]
*  I'm not going to try to corrupt his son against his belief system, ever. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10163.56s)]
*  What does your father say? [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10166.92s)]
*  All these people don't care. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10168.72s)]
*  They'll tell you in public education that these are their children. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10170.16s)]
*  They actually say that. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10173.84s)]
*  These are our children. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10174.84s)]
*  We are going to teach them to think for themselves, not think like you. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10177.439999999999s)]
*  They're audacity. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10180.439999999999s)]
*  And we tolerate it. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10184.439999999999s)]
*  My eight year old is going to think for himself? [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10188.439999999999s)]
*  You're going to turn him away from my way of thinking, if necessary? [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10193.439999999999s)]
*  Well, okay, then that's fine. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10199.439999999999s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10200.439999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10202.439999999999s)]
*  But we've allowed this. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10203.439999999999s)]
*  It's an act of war against your family. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10204.439999999999s)]
*  And they've done it. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10207.16s)]
*  We've tolerated it for too long. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10208.16s)]
*  It all came from the civil rights movement. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10210.16s)]
*  This thing has to be pulled up root and stern, but first it has to be, it has to be, we have [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10212.960000000001s)]
*  to expose it to people. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10218.480000000001s)]
*  It's almost like what, it's a bad example, but people will get it. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10221.480000000001s)]
*  It's almost like what they had to do with Nazis. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10225.08s)]
*  They had to expose it to people. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10226.08s)]
*  Now you know how terrible this stuff is, right? [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10227.08s)]
*  You didn't know it was about killing Jews, did you? [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10229.08s)]
*  No, we didn't know. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10231.08s)]
*  Okay, well you say you didn't, but you see what's going on and it destroys you. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10232.08s)]
*  The same thing that we're finding out with communism, right? [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10235.72s)]
*  People found out that it was just a horrible system, you know, the gulags and the murders. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10237.72s)]
*  And when they came out and said Stalin was murdering and killing people, well yeah, you [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10241.72s)]
*  made him a tyrant and he had no checks and balances. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10244.72s)]
*  And that's what they do when they have no checks and balances. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10248.72s)]
*  They kill people. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10251.72s)]
*  And so you look at this system also, a system devoid of morality and God? [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10252.72s)]
*  How can you have moral law without a moral law giver? [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10260.72s)]
*  And as I've told a bunch of liberals, and I hope they listen to me, all you liberals [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10264.359999999999s)]
*  out there that say you hate Christianity and Jesus Christ, if you want some advice, you [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10268.359999999999s)]
*  better let that slip. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10274.359999999999s)]
*  Better leave that alone because I know some brothers that if Jesus Christ wasn't holding [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10276.359999999999s)]
*  their hands back, they'd kill every last one of these liberals for fun. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10280.359999999999s)]
*  I know some brothers that were so-called killers that found Christ and they still got it in [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10285.359999999999s)]
*  their hands, but they controlled it. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10293.0s)]
*  If these people ever find or believe that Jesus Christ does not exist, these little [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10296.0s)]
*  liberals that don't want to have guns, you think they're carjacking them now? [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10303.0s)]
*  They're going to kill them all. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10307.0s)]
*  They'll kill them all. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10310.0s)]
*  So my advice to them is you better leave that stuff alone. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10312.0s)]
*  You better start pushing Jesus Christ as hard as you can to these young men because if you [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10315.0s)]
*  don't, they're all dead men. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10322.64s)]
*  Cursing Christianity is like cursing the roof that protects you from the storm. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10326.4s)]
*  It protects them. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10331.24s)]
*  That's right. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10332.24s)]
*  Why are they so very, and they're against it. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10333.24s)]
*  Love your neighbor. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10337.52s)]
*  Don't lie. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10338.52s)]
*  Don't steal. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10339.52s)]
*  Don't kill. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10340.52s)]
*  Don't covet what your neighbor has. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10341.52s)]
*  Hate it. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10342.52s)]
*  Right now, I think it's Texas. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10343.52s)]
*  Read a story this morning. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10348.28s)]
*  Texas or Florida. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10349.28s)]
*  They want to get rid of some curriculum because it's too Christian. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10350.28s)]
*  They don't want the children to learn it. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10354.28s)]
*  That's their reason. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10357.28s)]
*  It's too Christian. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10358.28s)]
*  And it all started from this apostate movement that went to government and didn't say, these [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10361.480000000001s)]
*  are our white brothers and sisters in Christ. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10368.68s)]
*  Some of them have been misled. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10371.12s)]
*  We are not misled. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10373.18s)]
*  We will teach them by our example. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10375.04s)]
*  We will love them irregardless. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10377.52s)]
*  We will help them whenever we can. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10379.38s)]
*  But this is a family fight between us and them. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10382.06s)]
*  They say they're Christian. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10384.58s)]
*  We're Christian. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10385.58s)]
*  We're going to teach them how we're supposed to love one another. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10386.58s)]
*  But that is not the government's job. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10389.74s)]
*  No. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10390.74s)]
*  The government's job is trying to make us love each other in peace and brotherhood and [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10391.74s)]
*  all that kind of stuff. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10395.099999999999s)]
*  Their jobs make trains run on time. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10396.099999999999s)]
*  And if one of us assault one another, have a trial and put them in jail. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10397.099999999999s)]
*  But the reasons why we do it is not, they're not just to be concerned about that. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10400.259999999998s)]
*  Of course, to love one another, have brotherhood and fellowship. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10404.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's aspirational. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10408.46s)]
*  But it's not the government's job. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10410.38s)]
*  No, it's not. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10411.38s)]
*  It's the job of churches, mosques, synagogues, families, community centers. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10412.38s)]
*  But government's not supposed to be involved in it. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10417.38s)]
*  Well, how are they going to do it? [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10418.82s)]
*  Tucker put a gun on you. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10419.82s)]
*  You're going to love him. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10420.82s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10421.82s)]
*  Well, it hasn't worked. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10422.82s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10423.82s)]
*  It never works. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10424.82s)]
*  It never works. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10425.82s)]
*  We've seen governments dissolve and then what happens, the fractions of society that [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10426.82s)]
*  hated each other before start fighting again. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10435.82s)]
*  They started fighting again. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10437.619999999999s)]
*  They thought they were killed 60, 70 years after. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10438.619999999999s)]
*  We saw it in Rwanda with the Tutsis and the Hutus just started killing one another because [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10443.619999999999s)]
*  government was the only thing that was separating them from the fight. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10451.98s)]
*  And it's novocaine. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10456.939999999999s)]
*  You think things are going well and it's not. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10459.3s)]
*  The only thing that made America, and you know about Christianity, how it moved the [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10462.14s)]
*  abolitionist movement. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10466.380000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10467.380000000001s)]
*  The Republican Party didn't come from anywhere. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10468.380000000001s)]
*  It was abolitionists training people up north to put the whole party together. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10470.380000000001s)]
*  And then they got behind the Republican Party and said, we want slavery ended. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10474.94s)]
*  And it was a Christian movement where segregation in the churches didn't even exist. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10477.460000000001s)]
*  Blacks and whites put the church together, fellowship together, love one another. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10482.7s)]
*  And if we can just come back to that basic concept again, but again, the primary goal, [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10487.98s)]
*  the thing that fears them, that makes them most afraid is to see what you and I are doing [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10494.619999999999s)]
*  right here. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10497.9s)]
*  A black man and a white man talking and fellowshiping, caring about one another as friends. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10498.9s)]
*  They can't stand that. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10503.18s)]
*  Well, I got to say, I mean, we're from very, very, very different worlds, but I can't, [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10504.18s)]
*  I'm going to be thinking about this conversation for a long time. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10508.74s)]
*  But now, looking back on the last few hours, I don't think I disagree with a single word. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10512.619999999999s)]
*  So that tells you something right there. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10519.5s)]
*  It scares them to death to see that two people like you and I, they might call you a crazy [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10522.42s)]
*  radical and you, whatever they might call you. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10525.460000000001s)]
*  But we can sit back and say, one thing you can say, we're racists because we'll be racially [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10527.66s)]
*  be fighting right now. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10530.94s)]
*  Well, that's true. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10531.94s)]
*  No, no. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10532.94s)]
*  I mean, I can say you speak for me. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10533.94s)]
*  Well, thank you, brother. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10536.18s)]

*  You're a good friend, Tucker. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UtxuyLco6o&t=10545.1s)]
