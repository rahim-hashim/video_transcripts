# Catherine Herridge Being Dragged Into Federal Court, the Trump v. Biden Debate, and Hunter’s Laptop
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg)
*  One of our sons asked me, Mom, are you going to go to jail? And I wanted to tell him that in this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=0.0s)]
*  country where we say we value, I get a little choked up when I think about it, but you know, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=6.0s)]
*  in this country where we say we value democracy and we value a vigorous press, that it was [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=10.08s)]
*  impossible, but I couldn't offer him that assurance. I was shocked that they fired you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=14.8s)]
*  Then when I reflected for a moment, I was not shocked at all. From my perspective, super [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=19.44s)]
*  obvious they're taking him out before the election because you're reporting on Biden's laptop. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=23.2s)]
*  10 days ago-ish, there was the debate. I've known Biden for over 30 years and I thought, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=26.72s)]
*  that's not the guy I know. I mean, he's just completely different. If I was a conspiracy [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  nut, I would think he was a body double because it's that different. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  I'm so glad you're back here. I'm so glad to see you. You are not far away. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=56.8s)]
*  Work together, we live near each other. It's all in many places. Amazing. How are you enjoying [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=65.36s)]
*  your new life? Pretty well. It's good. It's been an adjustment. I've had an energetic few months. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=71.12s)]
*  I knew you would. Okay. So I just have to ask you because you're, I was in television a long time [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=78.4s)]
*  also, but you were in the news side of television preparing interviews and packages and everyday [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=84.72s)]
*  for decades. Given your extensive knowledge of that, I'm just a little bit confused by how [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=91.36s)]
*  the media, people in our business, former business, could look at the last debate with Biden and Trump [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=98.0s)]
*  and say, I just can't believe that there's something wrong with him. That he's neurologically [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=102.64s)]
*  compromised or ill or senile or whatever, that he's not operating the way that he used to. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=106.8s)]
*  How could this be news to people who've interviewed him before? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think this is a real opportunity to gather more data and to take an investigative lens [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=114.0s)]
*  and look at this issue of President Biden and his decision to seek reelection. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=119.76s)]
*  We've got some data points already. We have the debate that you've just referenced that people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=124.72s)]
*  were so surprised at his demeanor. And we now have this ABC interview and the full transcript. I think [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=129.36s)]
*  it's a moment where other media organizations who've done interviews with the president over [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=135.52s)]
*  the last couple of years could release the full transcripts from those interviews. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=140.88s)]
*  I think it makes sense because we'd have broader data points to assess, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=146.0s)]
*  was this a one-off, as the White House says, or were there indications of decline earlier on? Were [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=151.44s)]
*  they obvious and apparent or were they subtle and missed? And if they were obvious, why was it that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  they seemed to end up on the cutting room floor? I think that having this broader data set [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=164.56s)]
*  for an independent review would really inform the public discussion about the president's decision [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=170.8s)]
*  to stay in the race. And there's a lot of data to look at. I mean, I've known Biden, watched Biden, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=176.88s)]
*  been around Biden a lot for over 30 years. And I remember my reaction in 2019 when he decided to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=181.44s)]
*  run once again for president for the fourth time, I think, I thought that's not the guy I know. I [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=188.96s)]
*  mean, he's just completely different. And then his sister told a friend of mine, actually, we're very [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=195.52s)]
*  upset because he's in cognitive decline. He's got some neurological illness and we don't want him to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  run for president. So I immediately said that on Fox News. So you reported that at the time. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=205.84s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. And then I showed the tape, like, look at this guy and was attacked, of course, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=210.0s)]
*  and ignored. So that was five years ago. I wasn't shocked by his performance of the debate, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=215.44s)]
*  especially, but then other journalists were they seem to be were they pretending or like, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=221.52s)]
*  I don't understand how someone who did an interview with him, like two years ago, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=227.2s)]
*  wouldn't have been aware that there was something wrong. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=232.16s)]
*  Well, I think it's an opportunity to provide this broader data set. So there can be this [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=234.16s)]
*  independent review by the public. What would that data look like? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=238.64s)]
*  Well, let's look at what the transcripts show. Do they show someone who is, you know, very [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=242.24s)]
*  consistent, very focused, very deliberate in their answering of questions? Or does it show someone [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=248.0s)]
*  who's maybe struggling to stay on track or is lacking? Do we have this? Well, media outlets [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  who've conducted interviews with the president should have those transcripts. I mean, it's, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=259.2s)]
*  it's not standard to release video outtakes from an interview, but you could release the transcript. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=262.88s)]
*  And I say that as someone who released a transcript of my interview with President Trump [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=268.32s)]
*  back in 2020, releasing a transcript, I think, is about transparency. So you can have a broad [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=273.44s)]
*  overview of the interview. I think it makes sense because there are other headlines in the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=281.68s)]
*  interview that maybe you know, your news organization is not going to look at per se, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=287.44s)]
*  you know, just sort of separately. I think you have a tremendous responsibility when you sit [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=292.64s)]
*  down with the president of the United States, probably the ultimate newsmaker to ask questions [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=296.24s)]
*  that are of interest to your news organization, but also to others, right? And then finally, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=300.56s)]
*  I think a transcript allows you to stand behind the edit that you either post online or that you [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=305.6s)]
*  broadcast, right? Because then the public can see the sections of the interview that you, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, condensed or you made edits for clarification. Right. So I know that in, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=317.2s)]
*  I haven't thought about this enough, but I know that in 2015 or 2016, the New York Times editorial [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=324.32s)]
*  board sat down with Trump and they released a full, apparently unedited transcript, which was chaotic. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=329.84s)]
*  His speaking style tends to be a little discursive. That's a great word. Yeah, it is nonlinear. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=336.24s)]
*  But you know, that's, that's well known. I think he's much better on camera than he is, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, in transcripts, but whatever you think of it, that they put that out there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=349.28s)]
*  I don't remember in the last four years, any news organization interviewed Biden and there have been [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  some releasing a transcript of the interview. Do you, you know, I don't, I can't recall, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=358.4s)]
*  but I don't really, I haven't gone back and looked at all of them. But so like, what would be the, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=364.23999999999995s)]
*  so I guess what bothers me is that everyone acts like this is a shock. It was not a shock to me. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=368.55999999999995s)]
*  I have no special knowledge. I'm quite some special knowledge, but I, which I revealed [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=375.44s)]
*  immediately, but it was like super obvious every time I saw him, there's something wrong with that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  guy. How could the journalists be shocked? Well, why don't they just release immediately? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=383.12s)]
*  Well, they could. That's, that's what I think makes a lot of sense right now to do that. That's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  ultimately up to them, but I think it just goes to transparency. I think it goes to informing the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=393.2s)]
*  public discussion right now about the president's fitness for office and to seek reelection. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think it's also about standing behind your work, right? Like you decided to make edits in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=404.8s)]
*  the process for clarity, for time, whatever the issue is. And so you can really, you can really [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=410.64s)]
*  stand behind that. I think that's important. But so again, you were in this business for so long [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  and me too, and at a time, you know, pre-internet pre-streaming where you have a very small chunk [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  of time, three, five, six minutes for the long ones. And then you just can't use the rest. But [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=430.16s)]
*  now news organizations should just put the whole thing. I mean, that's what we do. I do, this [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  interview is not edited in any way. And if, you know, we'll just let viewers decide what they think [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  of Catherine Harich or me or whatever, right? But so what would be the excuse that say NBC or CBS or [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  ABC or Fox or anybody would have to not put the full thing online now? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=455.6s)]
*  I mean, I can't speak to what their rationale would be. I just don't, in my case, I felt it was [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=460.24s)]
*  important to release a transcript, to allow people to see the work and to also, I mean, it's hard to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=464.72s)]
*  look at your own transcript because you look at it and you say, oh, that question could have been [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=470.24s)]
*  more focused or I should have followed up more or I missed that little piece of news I should have [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=475.44s)]
*  drilled down a little further or I interrupted there when I really shouldn't have. I mean, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  it's really kind of warts and all process that you're looking at. But it's about sort of the raw [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=483.84s)]
*  integrity of the interview. You know, when you make edits in an interview, you do it for clarity. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=488.96s)]
*  Sometimes you do it because you have to condense things because you only have a certain amount of [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=495.44s)]
*  time on a broadcast. But it's a real fine line and a balancing act. And you don't want, you know, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=499.28s)]
*  seeking clarity and brevity or condensing it to cross the line into, you know, a clean up on aisle [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=506.55999999999995s)]
*  seven. Well, that's what it feels like though. It does feel like, you know, I don't want to be too [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=513.28s)]
*  judgy. I was telling you at breakfast this morning, I edited something out of an interview once with [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=518.72s)]
*  somebody. I can't remember ever doing that before since, but, and I would not do that now, but several [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  years ago, someone said something so bizarre, an interview that I didn't want to follow up on it [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=528.4s)]
*  because I didn't want to, I don't know, what the hell are you even talking about? And so I asked the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=532.24s)]
*  editors to take that out just because I didn't think it was relevant to the conversation. It was weird. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=537.04s)]
*  So whatever, I did that. I'll say that I did that. But if you're interviewing someone and he seems [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=542.08s)]
*  like bizarre through the whole interview and you find yourself trying to cover that up, then [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=548.72s)]
*  maybe you're a liar. Do you think? Well, I think the, I think the instinct when you sit down with [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=555.36s)]
*  the president of the United States is this is your president. You want them to look their best. I mean, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=560.32s)]
*  I understand, I understand that. But if there were indicators, and I don't know there were, but if [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=564.16s)]
*  there were indicators that he was in decline or he was really struggling to answer a series of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=569.44s)]
*  questions, I mean, that's news, right? I mean, that's a news headline. Well, and the opposite of news [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  is of course, you know, censorship and deception. So if you're hiding that, then you're committing, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  well, a moral crime, but you're also committing an offense against the profession that you chose, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  whose purpose is to inform the public of what reality is, right? And you're hiding things rather [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=590.96s)]
*  than exposing them. And that, I mean, that, that's pretty clear violation, isn't it? Yeah. I, again, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=596.24s)]
*  I think it's an opportunity to build the data set, to better understand what's happened over the last [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=601.6s)]
*  couple of years and, you know, really apply that investigative lens. You know, I find it so hard [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=606.96s)]
*  to take off my like investigative reporter, but that's, that's sort of how I see it right now. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=610.96s)]
*  I'm curious. I'm genuinely curious to see what those transcripts may reflect. Well, in 2016, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=615.76s)]
*  um, you know, NBC went and back into its archives and found an outtake of Donald Trump saying [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=622.56s)]
*  something vulgar to Billy Bush, the host, uh, about women and grabbing them and all this stuff. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  And then they leaked it to David Farinhold. I think I'm remembering this correctly. I can't [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=636.9599999999999s)]
*  remember that exactly, but it came out publicly. If I, if I've gotten that wrong, pardon me, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  but they lead it to Washington Post reporter who had been a college friend of an NBC executive. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=644.9599999999999s)]
*  And then it became this huge thing that, you know, almost derailed Trump's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=650.8s)]
*  campaign. And that's why they did it, of course. So there's precedent for showing us the outtakes. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=654.8s)]
*  Do they have an excuse not to show it to the Biden outtakes? I mean, I, I can't really speak [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=662.4s)]
*  for them. I'm sorry to sort of be a little evasive about that. I just, I just would advocate for it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=666.48s)]
*  I think that it's an issue of such import to the country and it really informs the discussion and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=670.64s)]
*  the discourse surrounding this, this issue. And it goes to accountability with the White House. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=676.72s)]
*  Was it really a bad night or was, was there a broader trend that had been developing? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=681.84s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm, I feel totally qualified to pass judgment on that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  Over to you. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=692.88s)]
*  Well, I knew the guy and that's not Biden. That's not the guy I remember who, and I mean this, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=694.1600000000001s)]
*  I always, I never agreed with him, but I'm a, I'm a shallow person. So is he. So I always kind of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=700.24s)]
*  liked him because he's throw, you know, Irish guy throw his arm around your, how you doing, buddy, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=706.0s)]
*  you know, rub your chest. Maybe sniff, maybe sniffed me. I don't care. I like sniffing. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=710.4s)]
*  And that's just not the guy on TV at all. Like at all. I mean, if I was a conspiracy nut, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=716.88s)]
*  I would think he was a body double because it's that different. So anyway, or in your long and [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=722.64s)]
*  varied career, working in a bunch of different big media, the biggest media outlets in the country, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=729.04s)]
*  um, did you see people's political or social agendas shape news coverage a lot? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=733.8399999999999s)]
*  The short answer is, is, is yes. Um, I think it's difficult for people to step back and do what I [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=742.7199999999999s)]
*  like to say I do is, which is balls and strikes. Right. Uh, people have their own personal lens [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=748.88s)]
*  through which they see stories. Uh, but I think you have to really park that at the front door [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  when you go to work, because I think that's when you have the most transparent, credible, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=760.24s)]
*  authentic journalism. I agree with that. Do you feel like the composition of newsrooms has changed [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=764.4s)]
*  from when you started in the business? It feels like there was a greater, like actual diversity [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=770.24s)]
*  of life experience back then. 30 years ago, hard to say. I started my career at ABC in London. Yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=775.6800000000001s)]
*  And that was, uh, an extremely rarefied atmosphere. Yes, that's right. These are very, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  we're very experienced people. A lot of the correspondence came out of Vietnam. Yes. You [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=787.2s)]
*  know, very, very deep experience. And I was very fortunate to learn in that environment. I haven't [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  when Jennings was still forced there. Jennings had just left London by the time I had arrived. And, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  um, I, I wanted to be a foreign correspondent. You know, when you're that young, you have ideas. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=801.6s)]
*  Like, I just, like, it looks so exciting to me and some of the correspondence in the office really [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=808.88s)]
*  took me under their wing and taught me how to write a story by looking at the interviews, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=813.52s)]
*  the strongest elements of the interview, the sound bites, and then they trained me to really [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=818.64s)]
*  sit down and look at the video and identify the strongest video and then the natural sound, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  which really can be such an important technique. That's right. When you're, when you're editing a [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=827.28s)]
*  piece together, cause it's really like this mosaic, the strongest sound, the best video [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=832.96s)]
*  and the natural sound. So this was a really rarefied environment. Have I been in a newsroom like that [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=836.96s)]
*  since? I don't think so. What was the difference with smarter, more serious? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=842.64s)]
*  I just felt with, with that cohort of reporters, they're just, it was all about accountability [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=848.64s)]
*  journalism. I mean, to me, if that's part of my DNA, it's, it's kind of a new journalism is when [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=854.96s)]
*  you're, you're curious and you seek the facts and then you try and figure out where the buck stops. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=861.68s)]
*  Right. And it's not a question of, well, it's this party or that party. It's whatever [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=868.08s)]
*  entity is responsible and accountability journalism is, you know, like they say, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=872.88s)]
*  speaking truth to power on both sides of the aisle. To power is the key though. I mean, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  accountability doesn't necessarily mean, you know, hassling poor rural whites with diabetes, you [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  know, the weakest, most despised people in our society. It means like, you know, asking questions [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=888.1600000000001s)]
*  about BlackRock and the national security council and the people who actually have all the power. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=893.36s)]
*  It felt to me 30 years ago, like that was implied, like everyone sort of thought that your job was [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=898.48s)]
*  to hold the powerful accountable, not the weakest. I still feel that way. I do too. Yeah. We have [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=904.1600000000001s)]
*  that in common. I do too. Did you see that change? Boy, you know, I used to say to people that, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=910.0s)]
*  you know, technology was supposed to really improve our ability to do journalism, but I [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=919.76s)]
*  sometimes felt that the technology has never been better, but the reporting has never been worse. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=924.24s)]
*  And I don't know why that is, except... Is there a connection? I think sometimes what we're missing [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=929.28s)]
*  is that boots on the ground, person to person contact in reporting. Years ago, when I did a [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=934.96s)]
*  journalism degree at Columbia, I had this professor Dick Blood, that was his name. Dick Blood. And he [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=942.4s)]
*  was sort of a legend in New York City newsrooms. And he used to always say to me, detail matters [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=948.8s)]
*  in good reporting. You know, if you go to a crime scene, you want to count how many bullet holes [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=954.08s)]
*  there are in the windshield. So I think there's that kind of on the ground, sort of real traditional [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=958.24s)]
*  investigative feel sometimes that's missing in that person to person contact. Well, I agree with [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=963.44s)]
*  that. I remember going to a murder scene and looking down, there was blood all over my shoes. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=969.84s)]
*  I didn't put that in the story, but I remember thinking, wow, you know, that actually is shoe [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=975.36s)]
*  leather reporting. You get a real sense of things when you can smell them. You know, when you think [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=979.12s)]
*  back to major events, I was in New York on 9-11. And we were down near the World Trade Center in [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=984.0s)]
*  the days right afterwards. And I saw someone who was collecting ash off the top of the cars. And at [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=993.76s)]
*  that point, we'd realized that all of the abandoned cars in downtown Manhattan belonged to people who [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=999.92s)]
*  had been killed in the towers. And I stopped this woman and I asked her what she was doing. And she [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1004.48s)]
*  said, my sister wasn't the windows on the world at the top of the World Trade Center. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1009.36s)]
*  She didn't survive. And I want to have something to bury for my family. So the ash is what I'm [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  collecting. And that was the moment that I realized that so much of the ash that was spread around the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1021.6s)]
*  city was really people and the buildings and that kind of tactile feel to the reporting [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1026.48s)]
*  is the kind of reporting that really impacts people and stays with them. And I don't know [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  whether it's the technology or whether it's sort of the immediacy of all these deadlines, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1039.6s)]
*  but the ability to do that is much harder now than it used to be. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1044.08s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that's really smart. And technology gives you the illusion that [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1048.8s)]
*  all the information is on Google or a text away when actually talking to people makes all the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1054.56s)]
*  difference. So one phenomenon that I noticed or that I actually didn't notice until I was in [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1060.32s)]
*  middle age, but came to you're in middle age. That's what they claim. Okay. Actually, I'm way [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1068.1599999999999s)]
*  past middle age. I'm not going to live to I'm not going to math 110. So I guess I'm in late life now. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1074.3999999999999s)]
*  But there are beat reporters, people who've, you know, covering federal agencies, particularly in [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1081.28s)]
*  Washington, who become captive to those agencies, to their sources, you know, not in a literal sense [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1088.24s)]
*  are not held in the basement and chains, but they're, I mean, they are sort of puppets of [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1095.2s)]
*  the people they cover. I really noticed that I'm thinking of one specific person, I'm not going to [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1099.28s)]
*  name, but I would just say a female national security reporter in Washington, who, and I would [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1105.36s)]
*  watch these, you know, stories come out and be like, well, that's a lie. You know, it's a lie. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1109.04s)]
*  And you're doing it on behalf of the people who feed you these lies. Have you seen a lot of that? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1114.72s)]
*  I think that the danger is that people become sort of so friendly with the press offices that work in [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1120.24s)]
*  these big agencies that they, they find it hard over time to really challenge them. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1126.96s)]
*  That was never a problem for you. I noticed. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1133.44s)]
*  We work together for people who don't know Catherine Arridge. One thing I've always loved [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1137.68s)]
*  about you, I don't even know who you vote for. And I mean that, but I did notice that a lot of [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1140.72s)]
*  the flax didn't like you. So I always thought that was a good sign. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1144.4s)]
*  You want to, you want to have the ability to really operate outside the ring. I used to say that [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1148.24s)]
*  one of the advantages to doing reporting, as long as I've done it, is that you start to build a [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1153.92s)]
*  network of contacts so that that's really where your, your stories are coming from and that the [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1158.3200000000002s)]
*  public affairs office and a major government entity is really the last stop for you. Right. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1162.88s)]
*  That's where you're trying to get some response. And I really believe in, in giving these offices [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1167.3600000000001s)]
*  ample time to respond. I did a story recently where we engaged with the department of the [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1172.32s)]
*  army and the national guard for two weeks. I mean, we really gave them time because we wanted to [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1177.6s)]
*  understand their position and what had happened in a particular case. But sometimes the danger is [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1182.32s)]
*  that people become too close. That's why I think it makes sense. And in some cases to really rotate [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1187.9199999999998s)]
*  reporters so that you don't spend so long on a certain beat that you start to lose your contact [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1192.96s)]
*  sort of outside of that circle. That's exactly. Or you become a tool of, of lies, which some [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1198.16s)]
*  Pentagon reporters have become, I would say one in particular, but what's the mechanism for, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1205.68s)]
*  for pulling that person back and putting that person on another beat or for fixing that? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1210.64s)]
*  I can, I, I, listen, I've never been a manager, but it just seems to me, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1215.8400000000001s)]
*  when I worked overseas, I saw this with some of the British news organizations [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1219.92s)]
*  that they would rotate people into the United States for a few years, and then they would take [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1223.76s)]
*  them back to Britain. So they would be there through an election cycle. Let's say they'd be [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1229.04s)]
*  there long enough to build contacts, and then they would go back overseas and someone else would come [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1233.2s)]
*  in. So you'd have a fresh set of eyes and ears on. And I think that that makes a lot of sense. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1237.2s)]
*  It can be a little frustrating for a reporter because on some beats, it takes you a decade or [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1242.72s)]
*  more to really start to build the contacts and the reputation with individuals. But I do think [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1246.56s)]
*  that you have to check yourself. You have to ask yourself, am I really checking it out to the degree [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  that I need to be? As Professor Blood would say, just because your mother says she loves you doesn't [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1260.32s)]
*  mean you should not check it out. Right? That's right. I learned that firsthand. Yeah. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1264.3999999999999s)]
*  That's a different conversation. I'm totally kidding. That's so dark, but it is funny. So if [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1270.32s)]
*  you're paying any attention at all to what's going on in the world, you've probably asked yourself, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1275.36s)]
*  what would I do, not just for myself, but for the people who love me and I'm responsible for, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1279.68s)]
*  my family, what would I do if things really went south, either for a short period or a longer [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1283.28s)]
*  period, if there was an emergency, how would I respond? Well, of course, you need food and [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1288.24s)]
*  water. You need security, some way to protect yourself and your loved ones. You probably have [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1292.4s)]
*  taken care of all of that. But one problem you may not have addressed is what do you do about [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1296.0s)]
*  medicine? If there's a medical problem when there's not readily available medical care, what do you do [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1300.48s)]
*  for your family? And that's a tough question to answer, actually. But now there is an answer and [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1305.6s)]
*  it comes from Jace Medical. It is a personalized emergency supply of medicines you might need, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1310.48s)]

*  illnesses, respiratory infections, skin infections, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Things that could [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1321.4399999999998s)]
*  come up and happen when you can't just drive over to the doctor. This is preparation and for its cost, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1326.08s)]
*  probably well worth it. But find out for yourself. Go to jacemedical.com to get emergency stock of [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1334.16s)]

*  physician and dispensed by a licensed pharmacy at a fraction of the regular cost, not crackpot stuff. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1344.24s)]
*  It's essential. I have it. You should too. Use the promo code TUCKER at checkout for an extra [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1350.5600000000002s)]
*  discount. But don't wait until you need it. It's worth doing now. JaceMedical.com. I wonder, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1356.5600000000002s)]
*  since you spent, you know, you're at ABC, Fox News, CBS. You just left CBS pretty recently, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1363.28s)]
*  the spring maybe? February. February, okay. You spent your whole life, and I have too, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1369.2s)]
*  at these huge news organizations. And toward the end, you know, independent journalism, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1376.0s)]
*  digital journalism is on the rise. Like, what was the view of that from inside the big news [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1381.28s)]
*  organization? Well, I think within big corporate media, there was still a sense that they were [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1386.64s)]
*  sort of the final word on things. Really? Yeah, or, you know, sort of, maybe it's not the best [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1393.6000000000001s)]
*  phrase, gatekeepers for information. But after I lost my job in February, I took a couple of months [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1399.2800000000002s)]
*  to really educate myself about the marketplace. And I was surprised at how much the media landscape [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1406.3200000000002s)]
*  had really changed. Isn't that crazy that you wouldn't know that? I didn't know it either. I mean, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1411.76s)]
*  I'm not criticizing you. I mean, but isn't it weird that you can work? I'm in the news business, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1415.36s)]
*  but you really don't know what the news business is? I think you're very focused on what you're [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1420.0s)]
*  doing day to day, and you're not sort of looking at the bigger picture. But I took some time to [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1423.1999999999998s)]
*  try and understand how the landscape had really shifted. And I was surprised at how much it had [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1428.1599999999999s)]
*  really evolved in the four and a half years that I was at CBS News. And I say this as someone who [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1433.28s)]
*  spent my entire career working with big corporations. And I was grateful for those jobs. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1439.2s)]
*  I don't want to minimize that. But what I see now is that those entities are really shrinking and [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1446.24s)]
*  contracting and the audiences are getting older. And the real explosive growth is with smaller, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1453.2s)]
*  independent operations and smaller, independent newsrooms. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1461.1200000000001s)]
*  Why do you think that is though? I mean, if you're someone like Matt Taibbi, who also worked [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1465.04s)]
*  for Rolling Stone, you know, big work for a big company, but then went out completely on his own, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1472.56s)]
*  he has a substack, and then he creates his own news organization, but it's just one guy. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1477.04s)]
*  And if you look at his growth and revenue, it's so much higher than like people with the backing of [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1482.96s)]
*  these huge corporations. Like, how could Matt Taibbi get a bigger audience than [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1490.24s)]
*  Norah O'Donnell or whoever's hosting these? I don't even know who's hosting them anymore. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1497.1200000000001s)]
*  But like, how did that happen? I think the public is really hungry for credible, reliable information. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1500.64s)]
*  I don't think it's more complicated than that. And I'm not here to sort of take shots at my old [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1508.24s)]
*  employers, but I just, that's what I came away from. But what's so interesting is like, if you [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1513.76s)]
*  have, like if you're, you know, General Motors, and you have a sort of monopoly on your area, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1518.4s)]
*  and all of a sudden some guy starts building cars in his garage, and like, they're more popular than [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1527.0400000000002s)]
*  you, it's kind of an indictment of you, isn't it? I think the speed at which things have evolved [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1532.3200000000002s)]
*  has really surprised people. I mean, when you start to look at the numbers, I think we're at [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1540.0s)]
*  an inflection point. You start to look at the numbers. You know, for example, you did some [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1544.56s)]
*  interviews that related to the Biden investigation, and these were, you know, 90 million views, or [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1550.0s)]
*  sometimes higher, but these are big numbers. And when you compare that to what an evening news [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1556.0s)]
*  broadcast is, you know, 4 million, 7 million, 6 million, I mean, you're just reaching a broader, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1561.36s)]
*  larger global audience. And I would argue, and I don't have the benefit of all the data, but it's [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1568.32s)]
*  also a younger audience. And it may be an audience that's really engaged in gathering information, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1573.84s)]
*  because if they're on these platforms, they're checking multiple times a day for headlines, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1580.8799999999999s)]
*  for new video, for new content. So these are real, voracious consumers of information. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1586.24s)]
*  I think that's all absolutely true. But it leaves an answer to the question, how did this happen? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1594.24s)]
*  How did, you know, penniless upstarts beat, you know, the entrenched monopolies? And I just [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1598.88s)]
*  know in my own life, the only moments of growth that have ever occurred for me, the pivot points [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1604.96s)]
*  in my life have all been those moments from like, wow, I really suck. Like I really made bad, no, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1610.24s)]
*  for real, you know, I drink too much, or I got caught lying, or I'm just kind of a rotten person. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1614.96s)]
*  I have to change. And I got fired once for basically, I was just lazy and not taking my [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1620.5600000000002s)]
*  job seriously. I stopped being lazy. I started taking my job. You know, it is really important [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1625.76s)]
*  to realize how much you suck. Well, there's a forcing function. Yes. That's what I do. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1630.0s)]
*  Long-winded question. Do you see that process playing out at in corporate media? I can speak [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1635.52s)]
*  for myself right now. If, you know, I lost my job in February. You just lost it? Like you forgot [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1641.28s)]
*  where you put it? No, I didn't actually lose my job. I had a few drinks and lost my job. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1647.92s)]
*  Longer than my car keys myself. Looking around for it. You know, my job was terminated. That [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1655.76s)]
*  was a very public thing. I was fired too. I lost my company health insurance. That was a very big [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1660.56s)]
*  deal for us because we have a son who's a transplant patient. He's a chronic medical condition. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1668.8799999999999s)]
*  And then I had my record seized by my employer, which was a red line I thought should never have [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1673.92s)]
*  been crossed. And then I was held in contempt of court. So February was a very, very big month for [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1679.84s)]
*  me. But I made a decision once I'd educated myself about the marketplace, which I would never have [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1685.1999999999998s)]
*  done if there hadn't been that forcing function, that for now I was going to go independent. I'd [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1690.9599999999998s)]
*  had some opportunities from generous opportunities to sort of go back to a large corporate media [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1696.32s)]
*  outlet. But I decided that I would go independent and I would tell the stories that I couldn't tell [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1702.8s)]
*  before because I was at a point in my career where I had built up a network of contacts and I felt now [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1707.76s)]
*  is the time. If it's not now, then when? Amen. I couldn't agree more. So since you brought up it, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1714.8s)]
*  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make fun. I know it is traumatic to have your life turned upside down [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1723.2s)]
*  in a day. I just think you're going to be so much happier. But let's talk about that. Like, so you [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1726.96s)]
*  get hired, you were at Fox News where we worked together and I really enjoyed that. Thank you. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1734.48s)]
*  I enjoyed it too. I thought you were really honest. You're very well behaved. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1739.92s)]
*  I felt like I was a good moderating influence when we sat down together. I loved it. But then you [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1744.56s)]
*  left and went to CBS News, which is a huge channel with a storied past in decline. This is my [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1750.0s)]
*  assessment because they weren't doing what they're supposed to do, which is like tell you interesting [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1758.48s)]
*  stuff that you didn't know and be honest and brave. You are honest and brave and you specialize [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1762.16s)]
*  in interesting stories. So I thought, wow, this is so cool. This is great. I mean, CBS is a little [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1767.0400000000002s)]
*  smarter than I thought they were. And you did break a bunch of stories and you were the most [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1771.2s)]
*  memorable person on their air, the one doing the fiercest journalism. This is again my assessment. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1776.0s)]
*  And then they have cutbacks because their business is failing and they fire you. I'm like, wait, what? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1782.0s)]
*  Did you see that coming? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1787.84s)]
*  I didn't see it coming. It wasn't a performance issue. I'm so proud of the work that we did there, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1791.36s)]
*  especially the work with veterans. I mean, we really helped be a catalyst for legislation that [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1799.68s)]
*  impacted a million veterans and civilians for the better. I mean, I feel very proud of that. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1804.96s)]
*  But that's their choice, whether I work there or not. It's not my company. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1812.48s)]
*  But the seizing of the records was a terrible red line. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1817.76s)]
*  If you don't mind, I know this has been written about, but I just want to get a [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1823.76s)]
*  record on video of what exactly happened. So how did this unfold? What kind of warning did you have [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1827.84s)]
*  and what happened? Well, I testified to Congress about this as well. I was laid off on a Zoom call. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1833.36s)]
*  I was told my job was terminated. Can you explain why? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1840.96s)]
*  No, not beyond saying that they were making cuts. I was locked out of my email and locked out of the [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1845.3600000000001s)]
*  office. A couple of days later, a courier came to the house with just a couple of boxes of clothing [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1853.6000000000001s)]
*  and some books and a few awards. I said, where are all my investigative files and my research [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1861.0400000000002s)]
*  and my reporting notes? She said, you're just going to have to talk to human resources about that. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1868.4s)]
*  And I got the union involved, SAG, AFTRA. I'm not going to go into all the details, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1873.92s)]
*  but there was a very vigorous back and forth about returning the records. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1878.72s)]
*  What were the records like? Interview notes? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1884.1599999999999s)]
*  What I would say is that there were interview notes, research, reporter notes, contact information. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1886.8799999999999s)]
*  And when I had left other major organizations, ABC and Fox, it was completely different. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1893.04s)]
*  There was an understanding that you would go through your materials, you would take with you [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1900.0s)]
*  what was essentially your reporting materials, and you would leave what belonged to the company. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1903.68s)]
*  And I knew from people at CBS that what was happening to me was not standard. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1908.08s)]
*  One person in particular said that when their office was cleaned out, they put in dirty coffee [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1912.96s)]
*  cups and post-it notes. I mean, everything came back to them. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1917.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1921.12s)]
*  I think if the union hadn't gotten involved and there hadn't been a public outcry, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1922.64s)]
*  I would never have seen those records again. The union really stood up for journalism. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1925.84s)]
*  And I testified that when the network of Walter Cronkite sees this as your reporting information, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1932.1599999999999s)]
*  including confidential source information, it's an attack on investigative journalism. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1938.48s)]
*  And I heard from contacts that I've worked with over the years who've helped me to expose [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1943.4399999999998s)]
*  government wrongdoing and corruption that they were very concerned that they would be identified. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1950.24s)]
*  So, I mean, again, I doubt you will agree with this. I don't know what you really think, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1955.1200000000001s)]
*  but from my perspective, super obvious, they're taking them out before the election [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1960.48s)]
*  because you're reporting on Biden's laptop. And that's my take on it. I was shocked that [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1964.24s)]
*  they fired you. And when I reflected for a moment, I was not shocked at all. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1969.2s)]
*  They took out the dredge report before the 2020 election. They, you know, whatever, lots of [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1973.68s)]
*  people who were in the way have been taken out before elections. So, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1980.24s)]
*  what, you know, do you think your notes were, did they go through your notes during the time [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1985.12s)]
*  they had them? I really can't answer that. Because you don't know or? I just don't want [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1991.84s)]
*  to really answer that right now if that's okay. No, of course. I think people can draw their own [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=1996.32s)]
*  conclusions. Tell us about the reporting you did. You know, publicly they said they haven't, but [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2000.8799999999999s)]
*  anyway, I'll leave it at that. Yeah, we'll be kind of tempting to go through your interview notes. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2006.3999999999999s)]
*  I'd like to. I mean, why would they seize your personal reporting product? It was a very sad [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2011.76s)]
*  episode for me, just professionally and personally, because I thought that we had done some really [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2020.48s)]
*  tremendous work on not only the laptop, but also the IRS whistleblowers. I mean, this was a major [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2025.36s)]
*  story for CBS News. I did an interview along with one of my colleagues, and I think that really [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2036.32s)]
*  changed the public discussion of the Hunter Biden investigation and this question of whether there [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2041.36s)]
*  was a double standard applied in that case. So for those of us who missed the CBS report, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2045.6799999999998s)]
*  tell us what the tax investigation into Hunter Biden. So Hunter Biden in the end got convicted [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2051.52s)]
*  of a completely ridiculous gun. This is my personal editorializing, but ridiculous gun [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2058.16s)]
*  charge. Like who cares actually? But there are other potential crimes. Tell us about the tax. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2063.52s)]
*  I would think about the Hunter Biden case as having two buckets. The first was the gun charges, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2071.12s)]
*  and then the second is this tax case. I've always felt the tax case is a much more serious case. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2075.6s)]
*  It has the greatest legal jeopardy for himself and members of his family. I'd encourage people [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2081.52s)]
*  just to look at the indictment, which is in California. My memory is that it's on the first [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2087.6s)]
*  page or the second page. They refer to him as a lobbyist. And that to me is an indicator that the [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2093.04s)]
*  special counsel is exploring whether there were violations of FARA, which is the Foreign Agents [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2098.88s)]
*  Registration Act. And that in simple terms means that if you're working on behalf of the interests [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2103.84s)]
*  of a foreign government, you need to be clear with the US government. You have to register. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2108.72s)]
*  That's right. And seated throughout that document is information about his businesses with Ukraine, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2112.3999999999996s)]
*  with China, with others. So to me, it leaves the door open to a superseding indictment. I'm not [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2120.08s)]
*  saying that's going to happen, but it certainly to me was an indicator or a flag that that was [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2126.3999999999996s)]
*  possible. So, but the tax charges specifically, what do they amount to? These are felony tax [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2130.7999999999997s)]
*  charges. They're pretty significant. And a tax case, the challenge for any defendant is that [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2138.48s)]
*  these are paper-driven cases. They're not really witness-driven cases. What did you attest to when [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2144.2400000000002s)]
*  you signed the forms? What did your accountant attest to? And I think one of the important [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2149.2s)]
*  elements in the case is how much of this happened after he was sober, right? Because there's a whole [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2156.4s)]
*  window with the taxes where he's really a heavy user and drug addict. But as he told the Delaware [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2164.48s)]
*  court last year, when the plea deal fell apart, there was a period of time where he became clean. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2170.8s)]
*  So how many of these alleged bad acts happened during that period versus when he was an addict? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2175.92s)]
*  And that's relevant because sober people have no excuse? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2182.32s)]
*  Well, it just goes to your state of mind, right? I think any jury wants to understand [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2186.64s)]
*  someone who's come through addiction. They want to understand that. They're sympathetic to that [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2193.84s)]
*  because that's like a daily challenge for individuals. And I think that knowing when [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2199.52s)]
*  they were able to get themselves clean, I think helps inform their view on the evidence and what [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2204.2400000000002s)]
*  actions are taken. I think that's right. So what's the status of those charges? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2210.08s)]
*  Last, I haven't been following it as closely, but in the fall, I think that goes to trial. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2214.96s)]
*  It was just kind of interesting. I mean, this is relevant now, and I don't think it's often referred [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2220.56s)]
*  to in daily reporting on what Joe Biden is going through right now. So 10 days ago-ish, there was [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2224.56s)]
*  the debate. People were shocked. Democratic donors appear shocked. I talked to one of them who really [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2231.52s)]
*  was shocked, didn't know that Biden was impaired. And there was a pretty sizable push from members [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2236.7999999999997s)]
*  of Congress for Biden to step aside. And he's now issued this letter, which seems to me is written [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2242.96s)]
*  by his son Hunter saying, I'm staying in. And Hunter, it's been reported widely is in the White [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2248.8s)]
*  House. He's his father's chief advisor on this. And you're sort of wondering like, what is this? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2254.2400000000002s)]
*  And you're saying, well, Hunter Biden is facing this trial. Yeah. It's probably better to have [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2258.5600000000004s)]
*  your dad be president when you're in a trial than not. I really can't. Right. No, I'm saying you [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2264.0s)]
*  don't have to connect those dots. But that's not an irrelevant fact that he's facing these charges. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2269.44s)]
*  No, it's not. It's not. It's not an irrelevant fact. And I guess what has my attention is that [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2277.28s)]
*  over the last couple of years, there has been such an effort by the White House to distance [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2283.6000000000004s)]
*  the president from his son, especially in terms of business affairs. Yes. Right. But now they're [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2287.76s)]
*  really sort of joined at the hip, apparently. I don't know that independently, but you know, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2293.44s)]
*  they're very, they just did their relationship really suddenly change in that moment or not? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2297.1200000000003s)]
*  Or maybe it's always been like that. I don't know the answer to that. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2302.8s)]
*  Most of us, well, actually all of us go through our daily lives using all sorts of quote, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2305.92s)]
*  free technology without paying attention to why it's quote, free. Who's paying for this and how? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2310.1600000000003s)]
*  Think about it for a minute. Think about your free email account, the free messenger system used to [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2317.6800000000003s)]
*  chat with your friends, the free weather app or game app you open up and never think about. It's [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2322.88s)]
*  all free. But is it? No, it's not free. These companies aren't developing expensive products [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2328.8s)]
*  and just giving them to you because they love you. They're doing it because their programs take all [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2336.1600000000003s)]
*  your information. They hoover up your data, private personal data and sell it to data brokers [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2341.52s)]
*  and the government. And all of those people who are not your friends are very interested in [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2347.76s)]
*  manipulating you and your personal political and financial decisions. It's scary as hell. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2353.28s)]
*  And it's happening out in the open without anybody saying anything about it. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2359.2000000000003s)]
*  This is a huge problem. And we've been talking about this problem to our friend, Eric Prince, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2363.2000000000003s)]
*  for years. Someone needs to fix this. And he and his partners have, and now we're partners with them [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2367.6000000000004s)]
*  and their company is called Unplugged. It's not a software company. It's a hardware company. They [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2372.88s)]
*  actually make a phone. The phone is called Unplugged. And it's more than that. The purpose [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2378.24s)]
*  of the phone is to protect you from having your life stolen, your data stolen. It's designed from [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2384.08s)]
*  a privacy first perspective. It's got an operating system that they made. It's called Messenger and [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2392.3999999999996s)]
*  other apps that help you take charge of your personal data and prevent it from getting [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2398.08s)]
*  passed around to data brokers and government agencies that will use it to manipulate you. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2402.16s)]
*  Unplugged's commitment is to its customers. They will promise you and they mean it that your data [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2407.52s)]
*  are not being sold or monetized or shared with anyone. From basics like its custom Libertas [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2412.0s)]
*  operating system, which they wrote, which is designed from the very first day to keep your [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2418.24s)]
*  personal data on your device. It also has, believe it or not, a true on-off switch that shuts off the [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2422.4s)]
*  power. It actually disconnects your battery and ensures that your microphone and your camera are [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2429.2s)]
*  turned off completely when you want them to be. So they're not spying on you and say your bedroom, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2434.56s)]
*  which your iPhone is. That's a fact. So it is a great way, one of the few ways to actually [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2439.52s)]
*  protect yourself from big tech and big government to reclaim your personal privacy. Without privacy, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2445.44s)]
*  there is no freedom. The Unplugged phone, you can get a $25 discount when you use the code TUCKER [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2451.2s)]
*  at the checkout. So go to unplugged.com slash TUCKER to get yours today. Highly recommended. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2456.96s)]
*  Well, my impression, knowing Hunter Biden pretty well as I did, I think he was always close to his [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2463.68s)]
*  dad. He revered his father. I know that. There's a difference to being close and then being a [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2468.48s)]
*  business with somebody. Of course there is. I revere my dad, not in business with him. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2472.8799999999997s)]
*  But I do think it's, I know for a fact that he was always close to his dad, always loved his dad. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2477.12s)]
*  That's one of the things I liked about him actually. But, you know, it's all, these are very [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2483.2s)]
*  different circumstances from when I knew him. And so he's facing, and you know, these are [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2488.72s)]
*  charges that carry potentially jail time, correct? Yes. The gun and the taxes. The gun, right. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2493.52s)]
*  Interesting. So why do you think there's been, that seems like kind of a big deal. It doesn't [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2502.3199999999997s)]
*  seem like there's been, you reported on it, but there hasn't been a ton of reporting on that. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2507.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I guess what I would say is that I felt very proud at CBS News of the investigative [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2510.72s)]
*  journalism that we did, whether it was with the whistleblowers or whether it was with a laptop. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2521.68s)]
*  And I went to a lot of effort to get data from that laptop, which had a very clean chain of custody [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2527.3599999999997s)]
*  that I learned through my reporting was mirrored what was given to the FBI. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2534.48s)]
*  And I felt that was important to understand the integrity of the data. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2540.48s)]
*  Given that that laptop had been described by a bunch of retired intel officials as Russian [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2545.92s)]
*  public, as fake. Right. And we went to a lot of effort to have it forensically analyzed [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2552.56s)]
*  by a very reputable group and a group that was sort of no political attachments that was outside [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2560.64s)]
*  the beltway, a group out west and really a standup group, great group. They did a terrific [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2567.2s)]
*  forensic scrub of it. And they concluded that nothing had been altered or changed on the [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2574.96s)]
*  of the copy of the data that we had. Other journalists got their data through third parties. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2580.48s)]
*  And I think that that probably contaminated the data in some way, but I felt extremely confident [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2587.36s)]
*  about our data. I guess what I would, we did that story in late 2022. And, you know, my reputation [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2593.2000000000003s)]
*  is for moving quickly and efficiently through complex investigations. The idea that it took [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2602.4s)]
*  me two years to authenticate that data is just not believable. What does that mean? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2608.88s)]
*  I think that, and I want to be respectful of my former employer. I think that there was an [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2617.28s)]
*  opportunity to lead earlier on that story. I guess I would leave it at that. Well, I authenticated [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2624.0800000000004s)]
*  it day one because there was emails from me on there and no one knew I knew Hunter Biden. So [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2629.1200000000003s)]
*  I knew it was real because no one would ever do, you know, no one would ever fake it. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2633.76s)]
*  Had all your typos. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2637.84s)]
*  Also, like I had lived near Hunter Biden. That's how I knew him. And so, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2639.52s)]
*  I just live in Washington as you did. So it's not that weird if you live in Washington. It's like a [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2644.08s)]
*  small city. Everyone knows everybody else, but I knew that nobody knew that I knew Hunter Biden. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2649.04s)]
*  So like if you're assembling a fake laptop, you wouldn't put emails from like the Fox News host [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2652.64s)]
*  on there because that's too weird. So I instantly knew it was real. And I'm just a little bit [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2656.56s)]
*  surprised that it took you that long. So you're saying it didn't actually take you that long. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2663.92s)]
*  There were roadblocks. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2670.72s)]
*  I just think my reputation is for moving quickly and efficiently through complex investigation. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2672.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But it took two years for that story to make air. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2678.4s)]
*  And I'm glad it did. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2683.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2684.88s)]
*  Because I think it really changed the conversation. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2685.84s)]
*  For sure. Interesting. Did you feel, could you feel it at the company that like people didn't [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2687.6800000000003s)]
*  want you to do this? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2696.32s)]
*  You know, I've always tried to be respectful of my former employers. And I testified to Congress [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2697.92s)]
*  that, I mean, there was tension over the Biden reporting. Especially when I sort of turned my [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2704.56s)]
*  lens onto President Biden. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2712.08s)]
*  Oh, didn't like that. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2713.7599999999998s)]
*  Huh? I'm sorry. It's, I'll say it. You don't need to. I'm not even speaking of CBS specifically, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2714.64s)]
*  so corrupt. I mean, it's just absolutely ridiculous. Because it's not a reporter's [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2723.6s)]
*  job to cover for a politician, right? I'm just checking. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2727.12s)]
*  Well, you know, I like to think that I call balls and strikes. People like to talk about [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2730.08s)]
*  the Hunter Biden reporting at CBS. But I was also the reporter who obtained the audio tape [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2735.36s)]
*  of President Trump apparently bragging about these Iran documents at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2740.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2745.04s)]
*  But they don't talk about that. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2745.52s)]
*  Why? You should. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2747.2s)]
*  I mean, you should. But I'm just saying, you know, I'm kind of equal opportunity when it [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2748.48s)]
*  comes to the accountability. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2751.76s)]
*  Were there any? Well, I know that, which is what I'm saying is that your supervisors, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2752.88s)]
*  whoever they were, and you're being very polite, I would say, but they should have the same [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2758.2400000000002s)]
*  fair-minded attitude and, you know, allow reporters to tell the truth, period, no matter [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2763.76s)]
*  who it's about, I think. Don't you? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2769.6000000000004s)]
*  I think that's what the public's looking for. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2771.92s)]
*  And because they're not delivering that Matt Taibbi is more influential in CBS News. That's [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2775.2000000000003s)]
*  all I'm saying. Like it finds its own level. People need credible information. They need to. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2779.2s)]
*  There's such a hunger for it. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2784.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2785.3599999999997s)]
*  We just did our first investigation on X and we looked at the Defense Department, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2787.3599999999997s)]
*  specifically the Army and the National Guard's failure to look after a soldier who had a [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2794.24s)]
*  debilitating heart condition that they blamed on the COVID vaccine. This was someone who had no [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2799.68s)]
*  heart issues before they entered the military. And we did an independent review of their medical [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2805.12s)]
*  records and the symptoms appeared almost immediately after being vaccinated. And they're [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2809.8399999999997s)]
*  really amplified after they had that second dose. And- [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2815.68s)]
*  Can you fill out some of the details? Like how old is this person? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2820.56s)]
*  She's 24 years old. Her name is Carolina Stancic. She was a soldier in the Army National Guard. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2823.92s)]
*  And she was on active duty orders when she was diagnosed with this debilitating heart condition [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2832.0s)]
*  called POTS, which is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. And what it means is [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2837.04s)]
*  that there's kind of a disconnect between the way your heart is working and your blood pressure. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2842.0s)]
*  People can have blackouts, puts a lot of stress on your heart. And she's had multiple heart attacks. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2846.16s)]
*  She's had a mini stroke- [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2852.48s)]
*  At 24? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2853.52s)]
*  And we sat down with her just days before she got a pacemaker at 24. And this story [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2854.48s)]
*  appealed to me for months because she had paperwork we learned from the Army, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2861.76s)]
*  or rather there was Army paperwork that showed that they conceded over time that her heart [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2871.2000000000003s)]
*  condition was in the line of duty. And it was especially important. And when we launched that [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2877.44s)]
*  investigation, I felt along with the team that X was probably the only platform that we could have [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2883.28s)]
*  such an authentic and candid and open conversation about the failure of the U.S. military to take [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2889.04s)]
*  care of its people. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2895.36s)]
*  But I just find that crazy. I mean, I have a 24-year-old daughter, so it makes me emotional [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2896.4s)]
*  thinking about it. But a 25-year-old child, this girl, has a pacemaker because she followed orders. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2900.32s)]
*  So that's what she says. And that's certainly a credible claim given that's happened to a lot [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2907.12s)]
*  of people and everyone knows that. So why would X, which was not designed as really a news platform, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2911.2799999999997s)]
*  why are they the last outlet that would run something like this? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2918.64s)]
*  It's crazy to me. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2921.52s)]
*  I didn't really fully appreciate this until I started working independently. But we felt that [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2922.2400000000002s)]
*  X was the platform where we could really have an open candid conversation and we could put out the [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2928.8s)]
*  records so people could analyze them, in fact, check them for themselves to understand the issue [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2934.96s)]
*  and make up their own minds as to whether the Army and the National Guard had really let this [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2940.64s)]
*  soldier down. We just put it all out there for scrutiny. And I say this because what I heard [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2945.52s)]
*  anecdotally from colleagues is that other platforms, that story, even though it was a story [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2953.2s)]
*  about a failure to take care of soldiers, could be de-amplified on other platforms or labeled [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2960.0s)]
*  something that- [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2968.88s)]
*  But why is NBC News leading with that? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2969.44s)]
*  I can't really answer for those outlets. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2973.12s)]
*  But we both know they would never run that. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2974.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know if they would never run it, but I just felt that it was a completely legitimate [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2977.04s)]
*  story. It was a story about accountability, a failure of the government to look out for [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2981.2799999999997s)]
*  its own people. And then in her particular case, it took her 19 months to get the acknowledgement [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2988.48s)]
*  that this heart condition was in the line of duty. And what that means is that she's eligible for [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=2996.0s)]
*  different benefits and medical care. But because there was such a delay to get medical care, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3000.88s)]
*  because there was such a delay to get mental health care, she told us at one point she [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3006.8s)]
*  considered suicide. 24. And anyway, we heard from other people who believe that they have [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3011.76s)]
*  similar circumstances. And I say this with some humility, that's what good journalism does. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3021.6s)]
*  Well, obviously, there's no other point to it. Like, what's the point? I mean, either you're [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3027.7599999999998s)]
*  carrying water for people who are paying you to do that, which is just the definition of dishonesty, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3032.96s)]
*  or you're doing what you're supposed to do. The reason we have First Man Protections in the first [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3038.4s)]
*  place, which is tell the public what their government is doing, what the powerful people [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3041.8399999999997s)]
*  who control their lives are doing. I mean, I don't- [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3044.72s)]
*  And to the credit of the Army and the National Guard, we engaged with them over two weeks. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3047.44s)]
*  I felt it was very important to give them a lot of time to respond to the charges because they were [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3053.52s)]
*  such serious charges. And they engaged with us, which I thought was a very positive thing, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3057.92s)]
*  because I'm now working independently, right? I'm not working for a big corporation. And it [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3064.88s)]
*  said to me that they understood sort of the power and the impact of what we were doing. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3070.7200000000003s)]
*  Three million people watched that video or touched that video. That's a lot of people. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3075.44s)]
*  Global and young people and probably a lot of service members as well. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3080.8799999999997s)]
*  So I want to give them credit for that. They engaged, they tried to answer our questions. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3084.7999999999997s)]
*  Folks who are watching this can decide whether their answers, you know, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3090.24s)]
*  pass the sniff test. But that's part of what you're doing. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3095.4399999999996s)]
*  You've got a very generous spirit and you're trying to give people credit where it's due. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3098.08s)]
*  I will say, I've always thought just watching you from a distance that one of your main [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3102.16s)]
*  kind of advantages over everybody else is you cared less about, you know, what the prevailing [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3106.24s)]
*  view of the group was. And it didn't bother you to go in a direction that you felt was the right [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3113.9199999999996s)]
*  direction or to tell the truth even when it was unpopular. Why does it feel to you like a lot of [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3121.2s)]
*  journalists are, you know, it's a big deal to them what their colleagues think back in the newsroom? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3127.9199999999996s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3133.6s)]
*  I guess it doesn't matter to me as much. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3136.08s)]
*  I can tell. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3138.24s)]
*  I don't really have any other sort of explanation for it. I would say without getting sort of too [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3141.6s)]
*  personal because I'd like to keep the conversation professional. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3149.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, it's just interesting. It's like, why you? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3152.3199999999997s)]
*  If there's anything I hate more, it's injustice. I hate injustice when I see it. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3157.12s)]
*  And I just think throughout my career, I've taken on a lot of stories which are about the little guy [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3162.4s)]
*  fighting the big bureaucracy or the person who says, wait a minute, it's not, you know, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3169.04s)]
*  it's not adding up. And so that's really what drives me in the end is that sense of there's [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3174.6400000000003s)]
*  injustice and there's an opportunity in the case of this 24 year old. I think that we've seen some [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3181.1200000000003s)]
*  incremental improvements to her situation. I hope that her records issue with the military is [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3187.6s)]
*  resolved quickly because at 24, she's really given up everything. I mean, she's given up her health [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3194.72s)]
*  to serve this country. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3201.2799999999997s)]
*  She had a lot of other people. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3202.0s)]
*  The story was not a moratorium on the vaccine or the mandate. The story was always about [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3203.8399999999997s)]
*  the alleged failure of the military to take care of its people because that's the sacred pledge that [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3210.24s)]
*  you leave no one behind. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3216.48s)]
*  Well, I agree, but I would say that pledge applies to the entire country. The government exists [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3217.52s)]
*  only to serve us. That's its only job. We pay for it. We own it. This is a democracy. And [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3222.48s)]
*  so if they're hurting people and don't care, then that's the gravest crime they could commit. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3229.92s)]
*  That's my personal opinion. I thought that was everybody's opinion, but apparently it's not. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3234.96s)]
*  Apparently not. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3238.8s)]
*  Yeah, apparently not. Right. I'm not in the military and I'm never going to be in the military, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3239.68s)]
*  but an American citizen, if my government hurts me, I think it's just obvious that they should [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3243.28s)]
*  apologize and try to make it better. But they don't. So you're saying, we've had such a similar [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3250.4s)]
*  experience. You're in this little world, which you think is a much bigger world than it actually is. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3259.44s)]
*  I'll speak for myself. And then you get ejected from that world and you're shocked, but then you [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3263.52s)]
*  thank God for it because, wow, there's fresh air and sunlight. And then you look around and you [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3269.2799999999997s)]
*  realize that all these smaller organizations or individuals are having a huge effect. And you [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3273.68s)]
*  didn't even know that. It's amazing. I just love the whole thing. But one of the problems is [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3279.8399999999997s)]
*  it's pretty hard to take down a big news organization because they have a well-staffed [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3288.16s)]
*  legal department. Pretty easy to take down an individual with lawfare. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3293.04s)]
*  I mean, right? This is a concern. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3299.2s)]
*  Yeah. One of the things I'd like to talk about is the Press Act. The Press Act is a piece of [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3302.56s)]
*  legislation that's in the Senate right now. It passed unanimously in the House. And the [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3308.16s)]
*  Press Act is a federal shield law for reporters. It would allow them to protect confidential sources. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3314.88s)]
*  And there are just very few exceptions, what I would call common sense exceptions for imminent [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3321.36s)]
*  violence or threats to critical infrastructure. And I've said that I think the protection of [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3326.7200000000003s)]
*  confidential sources is the hill to die on because if you don't have that ability, a credible [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3334.88s)]
*  assurance that you're going to protect your source, as an investigative reporter, your toolbox is [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3341.52s)]
*  empty. I mean, you really have nothing to offer. And you know, and others, I can't say a lot about [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3347.92s)]
*  it, but I'm in the middle of a major case where I was asked to disclose confidential source [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3354.56s)]
*  information. I refused to disclose. Who asked you to disclose it? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3359.6s)]
*  It's part of a Privacy Act lawsuit. I'm a witness in the case. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3364.64s)]
*  So this is a private entity? There's a plaintiff. They're suing [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3370.96s)]
*  government agencies, including the FBI. And they want to understand the source resources for my [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3375.36s)]
*  reporting a series of stories, national security stories in 2017. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3382.0s)]
*  This is all public. So just remind me who's suing? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3387.76s)]
*  A Chinese American scientist and she's suing the FBI, the Justice Department, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3390.7200000000003s)]
*  Defense Department, I believe Homeland Security as well. They're like four or five different [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3395.1200000000003s)]
*  agencies. And the plaintiff wants to understand how I got information about her and her. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3398.72s)]
*  So you're not being sued? No, I'm not. I'm just a witness. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3406.0s)]
*  That's just the same thing happened to me. They grabbed all my text messages. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3409.12s)]
*  I was not named in the suit, but a judge said I had to divulge. So they're trying to violate, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3414.0s)]
*  among other things, your privacy, but also they're trying to violate the protection that we all [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3419.8399999999997s)]
*  assumed was real that confidential sources had. I want to be very careful because I don't want to [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3426.4s)]
*  litigate the case here. But the issue is the forced disclosure of confidential source [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3434.96s)]
*  information. So that means you as a reporter talk to people, they tell you stuff on the condition [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3443.36s)]
*  of anonymity. I'm not going to tell anybody that we spoke, but tell me the truth about what you know. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3449.04s)]
*  Correct? Right. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3454.0s)]
*  And this is something that journalists deal with constantly. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3455.44s)]
*  If you don't have that credible pledge of confidentiality as an investigative journalist, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3459.36s)]
*  you really have very little to offer. I've done it like three times today already. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3464.0s)]
*  No, but that's just that's your life. You're talking to people constantly about stuff. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3468.64s)]
*  Everyone knows you're not going to rat them out, right? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3474.24s)]
*  The question is in the appellate court right now in Washington. And the question is when the need [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3477.52s)]
*  for that information overrides the First Amendment and the reporter's privilege. I haven't lost a [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3483.44s)]
*  night's sleep over my decision to protect confidential sources. But that doesn't mean [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3491.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't feel a tremendous burden and responsibility with this case. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3497.6000000000004s)]
*  Tell us about the burden. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3501.36s)]
*  Tell us about the burden. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3502.4s)]
*  Well, it's so much bigger than just my individual case. It's not just about me. It's not about just [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3504.1600000000003s)]
*  a single series of stories. It's not about one media outlet. Whatever the courts decide, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3509.6800000000003s)]
*  and I have respect for the legal process and what's unfolding, whatever they decide is going [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3514.88s)]
*  to impact every working journalist in the United States. And the public. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3520.4s)]
*  Yeah, and the public and for the next generation. And that's why the Press Act is an opportunity [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3524.4s)]
*  to really strengthen press freedom and press protections at a time, as you mentioned, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3531.04s)]
*  that there's this explosion of smaller and independent outlets and they can't, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3537.92s)]
*  you know, they can't withstand the legal and financial pressure. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3542.72s)]
*  Tell us about the financial pressures. Like, what does that look like? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3546.32s)]
*  Well, right now, I'm facing fines of $800 a day for refusing to disclose that has been [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3549.92s)]
*  put on hold. And I'm grateful for that pending the appeal in the court in Washington. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3558.0800000000004s)]
*  But then there's the cost of litigating a case like this. This is not an inexpensive thing to do. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3565.1200000000003s)]
*  I've been fortunate to have Fox News, which has mounted a very vigorous defense, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3571.1200000000003s)]
*  excellent legal team. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3576.96s)]
*  Because you worked at Fox at the time. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3577.84s)]
*  That's correct. I worked at Fox at the time. But not every outlet can afford to do that. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3579.52s)]
*  And so having the Press Act would prevent them from sort of being sort of legally strangled in [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3585.84s)]
*  the future and losing that pledge of confidentiality. And if you believe, as I do, that an informed [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3592.48s)]
*  electorate and an engaged reporting corps is fundamental to democracy, you're going to want [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3598.96s)]
*  to see this opportunity seized and really realized. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3606.4s)]
*  If you think the public has a right to know what its government is doing, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3610.2400000000002s)]
*  which is kind of the bottom line as far as I'm concerned, and I think the public does, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3613.52s)]
*  public has no idea what the government's doing. I can say that factually. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3616.96s)]
*  No clue. They should know. And then you need to make sure the mechanisms exist for them to get [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3620.56s)]
*  that information. Correct? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3627.2s)]
*  Yes. I testified to Congress about this earlier in the year. And I just feel like we're at an [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3628.48s)]
*  inflection point. There's just this incredible shift in the media landscape. There's this [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3636.96s)]
*  exciting, diverse group of new voices doing some really tremendous journalism. So this is the [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3643.44s)]
*  moment to me where you want to offer these kinds of protections for confidential source protection [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3649.6s)]
*  at the federal level so that it's consistent with what exists in almost every state in this country. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3655.04s)]
*  And I think it's an acknowledgement of the role that journalism should play and can play in the [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3661.12s)]
*  democratic process. Yeah, it can't. If you make it too expensive to tell the truth, nobody will. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3666.88s)]
*  And that's kind of where we are. I mean, you can take people out with lawsuits if you're some well [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3673.3599999999997s)]
*  funded political group, particularly on the left. They've been doing this at scale. You just, you [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3679.2s)]
*  shut people up by bankrupting them. Well, one of our kids, as we were really wrestling with the [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3686.4s)]
*  subpoena and how that was all going to unfold, and there's a certain amount of, you know, you can't [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3693.8399999999997s)]
*  keep your kids off their phones, right? So they're seeing sort of some of this play out. And [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3700.16s)]
*  one of our sons asked me, Mom, are you going to go to jail? Are we going to lose the house? Are we [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3704.8799999999997s)]
*  going to lose everything that you've worked for? And I wanted to tell him that in this country, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3711.68s)]
*  where we say we value, I get a little choked up when I think about it, but you know, in this [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3716.8799999999997s)]
*  country where we say we value democracy and we value a vigorous press, that it was impossible, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3720.7999999999997s)]
*  but I couldn't offer him that assurance. And the best part of the story is how he ended it. He [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3725.84s)]
*  said, Mom, do what it takes. I've got your back. And I thought if a teenager understands the [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3732.96s)]
*  importance of this pledge of confidentiality and understands the importance that journalism plays [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3739.92s)]
*  in a democracy, then certainly Congress can get this legislation passed. Right now it's in the [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3746.56s)]
*  Senate. Chuck Schumer has said he would like to get it to the president's desk this year, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3752.88s)]
*  and I hope there'll be movement before the August recess. Social media are great. They're important [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3759.6s)]
*  are the main way we communicate with each other. They're where politics happen in this country. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3764.88s)]
*  But one of the problems with social media is that the rules change. The people in charge don't want [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3769.44s)]
*  you to say something. They don't tell you that. And the next thing you know, you're without a [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3773.36s)]
*  platform. Well, now you have an option. Parler, it's back. The original free speech app taken [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3778.08s)]
*  off the internet by the censors has come back in full force. Parler was the first big app to be [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3785.84s)]
*  pulled off because it was the first big app to make free speech a top priority. Now other [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3793.2799999999997s)]
*  platforms may be relaxing their policies and they change a lot, but Parler will not change. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3798.96s)]
*  Its distinct approach is here to stay. By paving the way for other apps to protect users free speech, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3805.44s)]
*  Parler has set the standard in the industry. It is now launched on a hyperscale private cloud [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3810.7200000000003s)]
*  called Parler Cloud, and that means your data are secure. Your words cannot be controlled by [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3817.36s)]
*  third party companies. It's uncancellable. Again, Parler has been canceled. They don't plan to be [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3822.88s)]
*  canceled again, and they've taken extensive and very expensive steps to make sure it's not going [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3829.12s)]
*  to happen. Parler is not at the mercy of other companies that don't believe in free speech. And [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3834.32s)]
*  here's the best part. It's ad free. You are not the product on Parler. Parler is committed to [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3839.44s)]
*  providing a space where you can share and engage without interference of ads or invasive targeting. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3844.1600000000003s)]
*  So it's more than just a platform. It is effectively a movement and its goal is to keep [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3850.88s)]
*  the free flow of information open globally where everybody can talk without fear of suppression. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3854.6400000000003s)]
*  So it's upholding the values this country was founded on free expression, open dialogue, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3861.12s)]
*  also innovation, by the way, we're on Parler at Tucker Carlson, and you can go there and [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3866.16s)]

*  protect the truth tellers. I guess that would be my view of it. I mean, I think the important [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3920.2400000000002s)]

*  when we can say, you know, we talk about the importance of the First Amendment, we talk about [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3941.6s)]
*  the importance of press freedom, and now we can actually really do something concrete to protect [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3945.92s)]
*  it. Yeah, I think you're right. And I do think the one thing that we can do is just not obey. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3951.6s)]
*  I mean, I was told to give up my text messages. I never should have done that. I knew I should [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3958.08s)]
*  have done it. I should have just still they're gonna throw you one gel. Go ahead. Come to my [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3961.52s)]
*  house. Try it. And I never should have done that. And in a weak moment, I did it. I mean, clearly, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3965.2799999999997s)]
*  you're facing this right now. I caved. You haven't. Bless you. But I mean, what are you [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3971.6s)]
*  going to do if they command you to do it? I mean, I just have to cross that bridge. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3978.24s)]
*  When we get to that, in the meantime, I've been so encouraged by how many media outlets have really [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3984.24s)]
*  filed briefs in support of our position that they understand that it's a case that's going [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=3993.12s)]

*  our world has become? So you work for 30 years or whatever more to become more? I actually know how [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4006.16s)]
*  long it is, but I'm not gonna a long time. And you become, you know, the most arguably famous [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4013.4399999999996s)]
*  investigative journalist in the United States. I don't know about that. Well, I would say that's [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4019.68s)]
*  true. Certainly you're top two or three. I mean, you are. Okay. But you'd think that every news [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4023.44s)]
*  organization be like, Oh my gosh, Catherine Harris is free. Let's hire her. But you're independent on [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4032.96s)]
*  X. Like, what does that say about the landscape? It's just, it's amazing. Well, it was a personal [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4037.6s)]
*  choice. I know that. Yeah. But really, I mean, NBC in a normal world would be like, Hey, we don't pay [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4041.76s)]
*  you $3 million a year to do what you do. But they didn't. So like, is that a little strange? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4049.44s)]
*  I think it's an indicator of how the marketplace has really shifted. Yeah. I think it's I think [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4057.12s)]
*  that's the biggest indicator to me. I didn't really understand how much sort of the earth had [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4061.6s)]
*  moved, moved beneath me in the last four and a half years. And when you start to look at the numbers, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4065.44s)]
*  you see that these big corporate outlets are not essentially the gatekeepers on the information [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4070.4s)]
*  anymore. Yeah, that it's that it's much larger on these on these platforms. And I, I really believe [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4077.6s)]
*  in my heart that there is a place for investigative journalism on platforms like X and other [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4084.56s)]
*  platforms. People are just hungry for it. And that's the investigation we did. It's like, as I said, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4090.16s)]
*  about 3 million people. I mean, that's a that's a good healthy number. Do you don't seem angry, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4097.44s)]
*  though? No, I don't. I don't feel angry. Really? There's not a smoldering ball of rage inside [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4103.2s)]
*  towards your old employers? No, I, I look if they don't want me to work there, they don't want me [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4110.5599999999995s)]
*  to work there. I know the work was, it was not a performance issue. I heard from many of my colleagues [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4116.4s)]
*  who were very, very sad that I heard from them too. Yeah. But that's, but that's not my call in the end. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4121.5199999999995s)]
*  But the seizing of the records was a completely different thing. That was something that I was [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4129.44s)]
*  going to go to the mat because I felt so strongly about it. Did they explain why they stole your stuff? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4132.88s)]
*  Well, in a letter to Congress, they argued that they had not seized the materials. I think the [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4139.76s)]
*  language they used was that they had tried to secure and protect them, which I left me a little [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4144.8s)]
*  speechless because it was diminishing reporter materials to work product. And to say that what [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4153.76s)]
*  had happened was an effort to seize or protect my materials was, I mean, it just showed that some [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4162.64s)]
*  executives had a very difficult relationship with the facts. That's kind of a problem for [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4169.52s)]
*  news executives though, right? I don't think it's a good place to be, to be sitting. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4174.96s)]
*  That's a very restrained way to put it. I am restrained. But if you have liars in charge of [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4181.76s)]
*  the truth telling business, that's a problem. Well, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that. I'm [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4187.4400000000005s)]
*  just saying that. Oh, I am saying that. I'm saying that. I mean, that's just, you know, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4191.04s)]
*  I don't know, there's certain businesses you sort of expect that, you know, timeshare sales or [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4195.92s)]
*  whatever use cars. But like if your job is to tell the truth and the people in charge should just like [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4200.56s)]
*  lie for fun. I said this before, it was very sad, very, very disappointing to see that happen. And [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4205.44s)]
*  I heard from people I used to work with and they were really saddened by it as well. Did any of [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4213.12s)]
*  them say, I got to get the hell out of here? I can't work for these people anymore. I don't [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4217.36s)]
*  want to go into the conversations. But do you feel like people who remain in corporate media jobs [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4220.8s)]
*  are desperate to get out? Is that your sense? I think there's a lot of anxiety. Yeah. I think [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4226.56s)]
*  people are starting to feel the sort of the earth move beneath them. You just have to look at the [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4231.92s)]
*  the ratings and the numbers to understand sort of the, for lack of a better term, the old order has [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4236.96s)]
*  has kind of disappeared. That's for sure. How long can they keep going? Do you think? I don't know. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4243.92s)]
*  I think this election cycle will be pivotal. If these town halls go ahead on acts, I guess, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4249.4400000000005s)]
*  the partnership with News Nation. I think that the numbers on those town halls are going to be [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4256.320000000001s)]
*  just mind blowing in the true sense of the word, and it's going to be global. And I forget, I think [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4261.92s)]
*  Elon Musk or Linda Jacarino posted on acts with the numbers were with the presidential debate. And [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4269.6s)]
*  I mean, when you looked at how many people watched it on traditional outlets versus the kind of [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4277.4400000000005s)]
*  volume and engagement on that platform, it was many multiple times larger. Well, the entire [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4283.12s)]
*  political conversation in the United States plays out on acts, period. I can't speak for sports, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4290.24s)]
*  entertainment, culture. I mean, there are many different verticals in any civilization, but the [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4296.320000000001s)]
*  political conversation takes place on acts, period. Does not take place on any TV channel [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4300.88s)]
*  or any newspaper. You think that's fair? I do. And I think it's exciting too, actually, to see it [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4305.12s)]
*  a little bit unleashed. It's not always pleasant. It's not always easy, but it's sort of unleashed [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4313.599999999999s)]
*  and evolving and engaging and it's bringing in different points of view. And I think that's what [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4321.76s)]
*  civil discourse is about. Did you read it before? I did. But when I worked at Fox, I was not on what [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4328.72s)]
*  was Twitter at that time. And then when I went to CBS, I joined because I thought it would be [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4338.88s)]
*  a good way for people to find me. What role do you think X is playing in the media landscape right [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4344.16s)]
*  now? Wow, you're asking me, that's a big question. Yeah, I don't know that I know the answer [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4353.68s)]
*  by the way. From my own experience, when I had an investigation that I thought was a sensitive topic, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4358.64s)]
*  I felt very confident that I could put it on X and there could be a really engaging, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4366.240000000001s)]
*  candid, authentic discussion about it. And I thought that was important because it seemed to [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4372.240000000001s)]
*  be an undercover issue. This is the soldier story. Yeah. And I was really grateful for that. And I [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4376.64s)]
*  would commend Elon Musk in that way. I kind of understood it. And then when I actually went to [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4383.6s)]
*  do it, I had a different and sort of larger appreciation for it, that people could have [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4388.56s)]
*  that conversation. And the comments that we received were, you know, this happened to me, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4394.64s)]
*  or can you look into this? And I mean, it was a very organic thing. And I think that you can't [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4400.24s)]
*  look into every case. You can't follow up on everything. But I think there's something very [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4405.28s)]
*  positive about people sharing their experiences and not feeling so isolated on a subject that's [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4410.72s)]
*  so sensitive. And I think that's really commendable. Well, yeah. And there's no, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4417.4400000000005s)]
*  someone who thinks she's sincerely believe she's been injured because she followed an order has [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4424.240000000001s)]
*  nothing to be ashamed of. And she does have a right to tell her story in public. I mean, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4430.8s)]
*  the whole thing is so nuts that anyone would prevent a 24 year old girl who thinks she's been [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4436.56s)]
*  injured by following an order from talking in public is just like, you're not on the right side [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4441.120000000001s)]
*  if you're preventing them. Don't you think? I think it was the right thing to do. I first heard [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4445.68s)]
*  about her story last October. And it's always been in the back of my mind as a story that should be [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4451.68s)]
*  done. And so when I decided to launch the first investigation, it just seemed like a natural to me. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4457.120000000001s)]
*  So when I think back when I got into this business when I left college in 1991, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4463.6s)]
*  you've been in it for a couple years, maybe before. No, not long, but 8787. So in 1987, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4471.68s)]
*  you work for ABC News in London, in the very the starter job of all starter jobs. That's crazy. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4480.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to convey now to younger people the prestige that attached to that job. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4487.360000000001s)]
*  And you had, you know, all the all the credentials necessary to get that. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4492.08s)]
*  And he went to Harvard and Columbia. Well, the joke with my father was, did you really [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4497.5199999999995s)]
*  go to Harvard to make coffee and fax documents and photocopy? I said, absolutely. Yeah. And I make I [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4502.16s)]
*  make the I do the best job photocopying and faxing of anyone I know. But it's about pride in your [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4509.76s)]
*  work. Of course. But it was such a different world. Like that was a really rich company then. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4516.08s)]
*  I mean, they had like catering and, you know, executives who first class, you go wherever you [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4522.16s)]
*  wanted. And I mean, do you ever look back on that and think, boy, that was just such a different [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4527.28s)]
*  time? It was I was in touch recently with there was sort of a little core group of us that were [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4531.76s)]
*  starting out at that time between the news desk and what they call the production control room. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4537.2s)]
*  And there were maybe 12 of us between maybe 22, 23 and 27. And we look back on that period [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4542.96s)]
*  is kind of like a like a golden window in television news, the quality of the correspondence, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4552.56s)]
*  many had come out of Vietnam, or had come out of Washington and then got a foreign assignment. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4559.44s)]
*  The crews were incredibly experienced. Yeah, you know, if you had a cameraman take your stand up, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4565.36s)]
*  he probably had been in Beirut during the barracks bombing. And the editors were so [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4571.360000000001s)]
*  experienced. I mean, you learn so much from from all of them. Oh, I grew up around that stuff. Yeah, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4576.72s)]
*  those guys were impressed. I mean, this was an incredible opportunity for me. And very formative. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4581.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And now. Yeah, it's just it's I remember filling out my tax return in 1991. My first job [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4587.68s)]
*  may work to the gas station on a factory, but I never like had a real job. And I remember, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4594.320000000001s)]
*  you know, occupation journalist, I was like, I'm a journalist. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4598.72s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know what I would put on there. If you know, I don't know, armed robber [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4606.0s)]
*  would be less embarrassing. But it was, you know, it seemed like a pretty honorable profession. I [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4610.88s)]
*  guess that's what I'm saying. I, you know, I hear what you're saying. And you're going to accuse me [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4617.360000000001s)]
*  of being so sort of deferential, but I just have always tried to stay focused on my own work. Like [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4622.48s)]
*  I have to answer to myself. That's not deferential. That's the opposite of deferential and ask kissy. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4629.28s)]
*  That's like, that's integrity. I just I just am like, is this the story? You know, there's stories [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4634.4s)]
*  in front of me, which is the one that I should really be doing. Where can I make the most [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4639.2s)]
*  impact? What's the story that hasn't been told that I can actually. That's it right there. I [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4643.04s)]
*  agree with you 100%. It's like, it's not that hard to tell the truth. I don't think it's pretty [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4647.92s)]
*  easy. Actually, it's easier than lying. What's hard is figuring out what you should be focused on. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4653.92s)]
*  And I think you're really good at that. What are the stories that should be told that aren't being [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4659.68s)]
*  covered? Our next project is going to look at the issue of immigration and the borders. And I don't [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4664.88s)]
*  want to give it all away, but we've got a lot of good data about how homeland security is in [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4672.56s)]
*  violation of federal law and regulations on a daily basis and creating, I think, a significant [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4679.92s)]
*  security risk for many American citizens. And I think that that really deserves a deep dive. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4686.160000000001s)]
*  And it's a story that I can really tell now that might have been hard to tell before. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4695.04s)]
*  So I can't even get, and I have tried, like a clear number on how many people have come into [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4700.08s)]
*  this country illegally over the last four years. I mean, it ranges from 5 million to 30 million. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4707.44s)]
*  And I can't, and those are all kind of credible estimates. And I have no idea which one is [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4712.16s)]
*  correct. But why can't we get even a real number on that? I think the simple answer may be, and I [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4717.2s)]
*  don't know, but my assessment would be that it's just the volume that we're talking about. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4724.0s)]
*  I think it's the volume. But to your point, I don't think there's great transparency on this [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4729.84s)]
*  issue. I hope to bring a little bit more transparency to it. So in your judgment, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4737.36s)]
*  that's a big deal story. 100%. Yeah. And it's not just, I'm looking at what the polling shows [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4745.12s)]
*  about the top issues for American voters in this election cycle. I'm asking myself, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4755.04s)]
*  I have information. I think there are violations of federal law and federal regulations every day [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4762.0s)]
*  at the border. I need to find out if that's really true. And if it is true, why is it true? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4768.0s)]
*  And who is really losing in that equation? Is the country less safe as a result or not? I don't know [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4773.76s)]
*  the answer to all of that yet. But that's a very legitimate story to pursue. And also, how does a [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4780.240000000001s)]
*  bankrupt country, which ours is, pay for all these services? There are many questions. I totally [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4784.72s)]
*  agree. But so you're focused on the question, is the federal government violating its own laws? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4790.4800000000005s)]
*  Federal employees, yes. And to the extent that you've reported it out, are you closer to an [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4796.4s)]
*  answer? I think based on our reporting so far, it really tips that way. It does appear that way. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4803.599999999999s)]
*  And so my question is, where's, you know, who's been disciplined, who's been suspended, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4812.879999999999s)]
*  who's been fired, who's been demoted? And I'm not sure the answer is really anyone, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4818.72s)]
*  except the people who blew the whistle on it. Really? Don't make me give the story away. I want [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4826.240000000001s)]
*  to stop you right now. I'm like so shocked. I mean, you know, but I think but that's the kind of, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4833.84s)]
*  to me, that's the kind of story you want to be doing. Right. I just think it's the thing that [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4839.4400000000005s)]
*  has always encouraged me about the consumers of news in this country, is that they really [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4845.92s)]
*  understand this idea of accountability. They want to see it, they expect it, they demand it. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4852.88s)]
*  And when you do it, I think it can be very gratifying to, you know, to kind of shine a light. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4860.32s)]
*  It sounds like so old fashioned, but to shine a light on an issue that really is worthy of that, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4866.8s)]
*  and is sort of screaming out for coverage. How do you, I've had many people ask me this over the [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4872.0s)]
*  years, but, you know, one channel will do a story or one newspaper will do a story and then every [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4877.6s)]
*  other outlet will do exactly the same story. And sometimes it's like a really boutique story. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4882.56s)]
*  You know, it's a story of limited obvious importance, but everyone does the same story. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4887.76s)]
*  How do these, like who decides that? Where does, you know, where does that come from? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4893.68s)]
*  I mean, I mean, this comes from the executives or the show producers. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4898.08s)]
*  But have you noticed that, you know, I don't know how many news organizations are in the United [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4902.16s)]
*  States in a country of 350 million people. There are a lot. They all do, you know, in a given week, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4905.76s)]
*  they do a suite of maybe 20 stories. Themes, you know, variations on the phone perhaps. But, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4912.0s)]
*  I mean, why? You'd think that... I really, I wish I could answer that question. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4920.24s)]
*  You've noticed this, right? I mean, when you look at the rundowns, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4924.48s)]
*  let's say for an evening news broadcast, you'll see a lot of the same stories. Now that may be a [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4927.28s)]
*  function of the fact that they have such limited time to tell the story. It was at 18 or 19 minutes [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4930.879999999999s)]
*  or 20. For sure. But the topics are the same. It's just interesting. I'm not suggesting coordination. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4935.679999999999s)]
*  But I do think it's a, I don't know what it is. It's, I think it's a conspiracy of like-minded [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4943.919999999999s)]
*  temperament. They all are kind of the same people. I just, I don't know. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4948.719999999999s)]
*  Huh. But you'll concede there are a lot of stories that they could be doing that they're not. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4952.56s)]
*  Yeah. I think so. That's the appeal of being independent is that you can tell some of the [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4957.68s)]
*  stories that maybe you couldn't tell before. Is it weird not to have a boss? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4963.84s)]
*  Yeah. It's a big change after nearly four decades of working for major media outlets. It's a huge [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4969.360000000001s)]
*  change. I've had a lot of change in the last four months, five months, a lot. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4977.12s)]
*  Do you miss being scolded? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4982.24s)]
*  I miss the structure. I'm very used to the structure. And a structure that has resources [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4987.5199999999995s)]
*  that you didn't realize that you needed until you went to do it yourself. I'm sure you understand. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=4995.2s)]
*  Oh, been there. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5000.88s)]
*  Yeah. You've been there, right? But I really like working with a small team and as a group [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5001.68s)]
*  deciding what is it that we're going to pursue next and how can we structure this story that it [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5009.76s)]
*  has an impact and what kind of reporting do we need to be doing? And at what point do we engage [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5016.08s)]
*  with government agencies and how do we keep moving the story forward after we do it? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5022.0s)]
*  I just find that just kind of exhilarating and refreshing all at the same time. And [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5029.2s)]
*  in a marketplace that's really just exploding where you're setting your own boundaries and your [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5036.08s)]
*  own rules, right? You're saying, okay, I've got almost four decades of experience. This is what [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5044.5599999999995s)]
*  I believe journalism is. This is how I'm going to execute it. These are my standards. These are my [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5050.16s)]
*  expectations and I'm going to be true to those. I'm going to follow it through. That's the exciting [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5055.28s)]
*  part of it. And then having a public that responds to it, which I'm so grateful for. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5062.0s)]
*  People like honesty in a world full of lies, I think. Do you feel that? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5068.16s)]
*  People are looking for credible, reliable information in a way that I [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5073.759999999999s)]
*  never may be seen in my lifetime working as a journalist. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5078.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, so maybe what you're saying is that as a business, journalism is more discredited [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5082.64s)]
*  than it's ever been and more disliked, but individual journalists who decide to tell the truth [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5088.88s)]
*  are... I don't know if I would go that far. I'm not sure how comfortable I am really [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5093.92s)]
*  commenting on the whole profession that way. I just sort of come back to my own work. I [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5100.32s)]
*  wrote something recently for the Free Press, which is really an amazing operation. Barry Weiss has [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5110.4s)]
*  really built it into this sort of engaging, driving thing. It's like a great source for [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5116.639999999999s)]
*  information. I wrote something on the Press Act. The protection of sources is the hill to die on. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5125.12s)]
*  It was such a great experience to work with them and to see the reach of that story and to take an [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5133.5199999999995s)]
*  issue that I felt needed to kind of poke up through the noise and get some attention because [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5140.08s)]
*  all of our futures, our careers, rest on that basic principle. To me, that's an example of [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5147.5199999999995s)]
*  an independent media outlet, which really has a lot of impact and made a difference. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5154.48s)]
*  How of the people that you worked with 30 years ago? Were any still around in the business? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5159.12s)]
*  Oh, I'm trying to think. A lot of them are retired now. I went to a reunion, an ABC London [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5165.04s)]
*  reunion. I want to say it was maybe seven years ago, six or seven. It was just before I went to [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5172.0s)]
*  CBS and a lot of people were retired. A lot of people had passed. Five of them were already gone. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5178.96s)]
*  Is that weird? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5186.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's sad, but I learned so much from them. I think that, not to sound too sentimental, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5187.68s)]
*  but I think you carry that on. I think one of the greatest things you can do at a certain point in [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5196.96s)]
*  your career is to share your experience and to share the skill set that you have. I really enjoy [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5201.68s)]
*  doing that, especially with younger journalists. How long are you going to do it? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5208.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, I talk about this with our kids. How long am I going to do this? When will I retire? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5213.68s)]
*  They all have the same verdict, which is like, oh, mom, you need to keep working as long as [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5222.0s)]
*  you can work. Because if we had you loose in the house all the time, it would just be crazy. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5226.48s)]
*  I just love it. I feel fortunate to have found something I feel so passionate about. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5233.76s)]
*  Oh, of course I do. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5238.32s)]
*  Maybe you feel the same way. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5239.84s)]
*  Of course. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5241.76s)]
*  I'm surprised even by the evolution of where I am today, and I'm surprised that I'm fighting [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5243.5199999999995s)]
*  in the courts to be protecting confidential sources. But if there's something that folks [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5253.76s)]
*  who are listening and watching this can take away is that I came out of February, so it was a tough [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5262.0s)]
*  time. There's no question about it. But I had a lot of clarity, and sometimes crisis [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5268.08s)]
*  gives you clarity. And the idea of a free press and free speech, these really became my North Star. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5275.04s)]
*  They really became the driving force of what I'm going to do in this next chapter. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5283.28s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And it's weird to wake up and see things you took for granted [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5288.88s)]
*  under threat. Did you ever think that free speech in the United States would be open to question? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5293.68s)]
*  No, I wouldn't have anticipated the situation that I'm in now, that's for sure. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5300.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, we're rooting for you fervently. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5306.320000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5308.72s)]
*  Catherine Harich, thank you very much. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5309.280000000001s)]
*  It's so good to see you. Thanks for having me. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5310.56s)]
*  Great to see you. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5311.6s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5316.56s)]
*  I know. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5320.72s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year, with everything at stake, Google would be putting its thumb on the [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5321.76s)]
*  scale and preventing you from hearing anything that the people in charge don't want you to hear. But [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5327.4400000000005s)]
*  it turns out it's happening. So what can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5333.52s)]
*  But that's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5337.04s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that's true. It's not intentionally deceptive. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5341.52s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5347.52s)]
*  and you'll have a much higher chance of hearing what we say. And we hope you will. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fikmsCkjgg&t=5352.8s)]
