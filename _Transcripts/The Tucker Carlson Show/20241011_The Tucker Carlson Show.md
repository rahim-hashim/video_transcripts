# Harmeet Dhillon The Shocking Origin Story of Kamala Harris and All the Crimes She’s Committed
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM)
*  James O'Keefe's Line in the Sand premiering only on TCN on October 10th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=0.0s)]
*  You can sign up to watch it at Tucker Carlson dot com. James O'Keefe's new [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=6.88s)]
*  documentary, Line in the Sand, at Tucker Carlson dot com. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=11.48s)]
*  So you are roughly you're younger than Kamala Harris, but in the same [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=30.0s)]
*  generation. You're an attorney. You're from San Francisco. You first ran into [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=48.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris in 2003, 21 years ago. You know everyone in her orbit. You live in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=54.66s)]
*  the same world. And so with less than a month to go before the campaign, I [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=60.58s)]
*  thought it'd be interesting to hear the perspective of someone who actually [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=65.7s)]
*  knows a lot about Kamala Harris's life. There don't seem to be many of those. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  So thank you for doing this. Who is Kamala Harris exactly? Well, you see the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=73.3s)]
*  words, comma, chameleon, and you know nicknames like that applied to her today. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=83.66000000000001s)]
*  Yes. And she really has been kind of a shape-shifter throughout her entire [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=88.14s)]
*  career and existence. I would call her in some ways a survivor. You know she's had [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=92.54s)]
*  a number of different environments. Sort of growing up in Oakland to two [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  university professors as a small kid. And then after a divorce, her mom took her [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=102.64s)]
*  and her sister Maya to Canada where she went to high school and then started [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=109.26s)]
*  college there. Montreal? Yeah. And then she you know came as almost an adult to the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=114.66000000000001s)]
*  United States and went to Howard University and sort of immersed herself [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  in that culture of the predominantly black college. And then she came to San [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=125.7s)]
*  Francisco where she went to Hastings in the Tenderloin area of San Francisco. So [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=132.46s)]
*  educationally she's kind of traveled all over the United States. But she spent her [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=139.18s)]
*  high school years in Canada. Yes, she spent her high school years in Canada and you [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=143.78s)]
*  know not in San Francisco. And so I think one of the interesting things that I [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=149.58s)]
*  found when looking at her background is the first time she registered to vote [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=153.74s)]
*  was at age 29. So really? Yeah. So many years after coming to the United States [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=157.66s)]
*  and during the year that she dated our former mayor and speaker Willie Brown is [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=164.74s)]
*  the year that she registered to vote. And so connecting the dots it seems like [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=170.62s)]
*  that might be the time when she decided that politics is in her future because [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=174.9s)]
*  you know she began to create a voting record and and setting down. But she [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=178.9s)]
*  hadn't registered to vote before. There's no record of her having registered to vote until she was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=184.66s)]
*  almost 30. Which is you know I have nieces and nephews and I urged them to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  get educated and register to vote and and get active. And so you know it's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=193.42s)]
*  kind of an important thing. So well after she became an attorney, well after she [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  became a prosecutor she hadn't registered to vote. Well that's interesting. 11 years. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=203.26s)]
*  Yeah. She was eligible. Yeah. Yep. And that's interesting not because everyone [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=208.94s)]
*  has to vote in my opinion but because she's described herself repeatedly in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  public as a child activist. Yeah. She was basically leading the March on Washington. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=218.2s)]
*  She single-handedly desegregated the American South. Right. You know she was [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=223.02s)]
*  always into politics. She was a warrior for freedom. You know early on and there [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=226.46s)]
*  wasn't just for the record there was no segregation. Yeah. I mean her mom was [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=233.86s)]
*  interviewed many years ago before she passed away and tells a story about how [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=238.66000000000003s)]
*  where they were growing up in in Montreal in the apartment complex where [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=242.46s)]
*  they lived. Apparently children weren't allowed to play outside so Kamala Harris [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  single-handedly protested this and organized and forced the apartment [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=254.06s)]
*  building to allow children to be able to play outdoors. So she was annoying as a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=259.86s)]
*  child. She was a you know activist as a child according to her mom but [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=265.86s)]
*  then you know didn't exercise the most basic form of United States citizen [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=271.38s)]
*  activism by exercising the franchise until much later in life. After she [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=278.02s)]
*  was a lawyer how did she become a lawyer? Well she became a lawyer went to UC [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=284.21999999999997s)]
*  Hastings in downtown San Francisco. Did not pass the bar the first time she took [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=288.53999999999996s)]
*  it. Did pass it the second time around and got her first job after that as a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=294.0s)]
*  prosecutor in Alameda County. So in Alameda County she eventually specialized [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=300.82s)]
*  in child sex crimes you know an important job and according to research [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=307.62s)]
*  that was done by some of her opposition when she ran for district attorney in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=315.02s)]
*  2003 she tried something like eight cases that they can prove there during [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  her eight years or so as a prosecutor in Alameda County. So I lack perspective on [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=324.3s)]
*  this. Is that a lot? A little? It's very little. Very little. For somebody who's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=330.74s)]
*  claimed today in all of her public appearances to have been a you know [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=334.66s)]
*  lifelong law enforcement officer and prosecutor and when she ran for district [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=340.3s)]
*  attorney claimed to have tried hundreds of cases she actually according to what [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=344.62s)]
*  I've been able to dig up and what her opposition dug up on her in 2003 which [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=350.26000000000005s)]
*  she never refuted two cases in San Francisco during the two years that she [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=354.82000000000005s)]
*  worked at the DA's office before quitting and then planning her run [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=359.26000000000005s)]
*  against her boss eight in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. So she [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=364.1s)]
*  basically held those two jobs as a prosecutor. Now Terrence Hallinan, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=369.42s)]
*  let's setting the stage of my meeting her in San Francisco. So San Francisco had [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=374.66s)]
*  a very progressive prosecutor I think he was elected in 2006 sorry 1996 or so [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=379.70000000000005s)]
*  named Terrence Hallinan. Famous person. Famous guy he was one of some [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=385.3s)]
*  brothers. My departed husband served on the board of the liberal Pacifica radio [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=389.74s)]
*  station with the other one of the other Hallinan brothers so you know they were [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=396.46000000000004s)]
*  kind of regulars in the left-wing activist circles in San Francisco and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=400.06s)]
*  Hallinan promised to be a progressive prosecutor and you know he came on board [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=406.74s)]
*  and was a progressive prosecutor would you know serve soup at the soup kitchens [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=411.14s)]
*  and things like that. Kind of old-school liberal and that said he was tough on [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=415.82000000000005s)]
*  murders and tough on the serious crimes but it was a lower level drug dealers [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=422.5s)]
*  and so forth that quality of life crimes that he was a little bit softer on but [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=426.54s)]
*  he recruited Kamala Harris or hired her anyway and she hired her out of the Alameda [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=431.42s)]
*  County District Attorney's office and during that campaign in 2003 he actually [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=439.38s)]
*  said that he did it as a favor to the mayor of San Francisco Willie Brown but [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=445.78s)]
*  there's a mixed record on that but he gave her her chance to move from the job [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=452.1s)]
*  she was in which was sort of you know Alameda County's not San Francisco you [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=457.02s)]
*  know San Francisco's the the big leagues where all the glamorous stuff happens in [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=461.18s)]
*  the Bay Area and where we had two United States senators from there a lot of the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=464.82s)]
*  top brass in California that's now infecting the United States came from [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  Cal from San Francisco County so she was a step up to go to be a prosecutor in the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=475.62s)]
*  big city there in San Francisco so she got her opportunity to move over there [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=480.7s)]
*  and she was the head of the criminal organizations five-person unit after [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=484.46s)]
*  being there for a bit of time and so you know it was five people she was in charge [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=495.26s)]
*  of but she was passed over for chief of staff which is the number two position [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=498.85999999999996s)]
*  in the district attorney's office on two occasions and you know as soon as she [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=502.97999999999996s)]
*  got there she began making her mark and setting her eyes on her political career [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=506.7s)]
*  okay so starting around age 29 again when she moved to San Francisco she [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=510.46s)]
*  started dating the mayor of San Francisco Willie Brown and while he was [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=515.42s)]
*  mayor while he was mayor and he had been the speaker of the assembly he was maybe [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=521.06s)]
*  the most powerful machine politician in Democrat politics Willie Brown and John [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=527.5s)]
*  Burton ran San Francisco they had a political machine and to win election in [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=534.3s)]
*  that town their stamp of approval was necessary and they really had a I mean [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=539.38s)]
*  not a complete control but they were the most formidable block to get ahead in [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=544.86s)]
*  San Francisco so they kind of approved who got to be on the board of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=549.98s)]
*  supervisors who you know really ran for all these different positions and handed [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=553.54s)]
*  out patronage jobs in the city and so the fastest way to ascend in politics [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=558.14s)]
*  there is to be tied to the coattails of Willie Brown and so you know she did [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=564.42s)]
*  that and I don't know more tied more than tied to the coattails I mean yeah I [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=570.06s)]
*  mean she's sleeping with she dated him yeah that's how he describes it he's he [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=573.78s)]
*  is still married at the time and so he's 90 today but he was married [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  throughout this time that he was together with her for two years okay and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=581.14s)]
*  so they were a society couple and they went to all the operas ballets black tie [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=585.54s)]
*  events very openly and you know I've met Willie Brown several times he just you [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=591.78s)]
*  know that's not disputed that he gave her her start in politics and almost [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=595.22s)]
*  certainly encouraged her hey maybe you should register to vote that might be a [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=600.02s)]
*  good start certainly how to move up in the ranks and so one of the ways you do [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=604.14s)]
*  that is you get started with some lower level elective office but even before [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=611.34s)]
*  that a lot of our politicians in Congress and in the Senate and you know [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=615.9s)]
*  former presidents have been lawyers it's a great stepping stone to a [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=620.5s)]
*  political career so getting a good record in the DA's office would have [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=625.66s)]
*  been a way to do that so she you know hustled her way into the district [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=631.66s)]
*  attorney's office and immediately began setting her sights on her power base so [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=637.02s)]
*  she developed relationships in the African-American community became [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=641.98s)]
*  friendly with Amos Brown a notorious pastor and activist in the Bayview [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=647.14s)]
*  Hunters Point district where is a large African-American population there and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=653.18s)]
*  you know it's one of the rougher parts of town where the projects are a lot of [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=658.06s)]
*  the drug and gang violence was centered in that area and so she tried to make [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=662.46s)]
*  that her patch and her theme was you know supposedly hard on crime but but [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=666.22s)]
*  not in an unfair disproportionate way on the African-American community so as you [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=674.4599999999999s)]
*  know during that time the 1990s there was a lot of discussion in our country [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=678.9399999999999s)]
*  about harsh drug laws and disproportionate impact on African-Americans [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=684.02s)]
*  and so she kind of focused her efforts on that and that was her assignment was [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=688.4599999999999s)]
*  criminal organizations basically gangs okay so she was a gang and drug [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=694.2199999999999s)]
*  prosecutor not a murder prosecutor not a violent crime prosecutor she never was [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=699.86s)]
*  that in her jobs before she became the district attorney so she wanted those [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=704.02s)]
*  jobs according to reporting at the time she wanted to be moved up to the more [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=710.26s)]
*  serious responsibilities of violent crime and murder prosecutor but she [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=716.22s)]
*  never was given that opportunity by Terrence Helen and who I think reading [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=720.62s)]
*  between the lines began to suspect that he was she was gunning for his job pretty [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=725.74s)]
*  early on so after she was passed over a couple of times for the top lieutenant [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=730.3399999999999s)]
*  position in the district attorney's office she quit she quit and she went [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=736.06s)]
*  immediately sideways to the city attorney's office in San Francisco which [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=741.8199999999999s)]
*  is also a prominent breeding ground for some some excellent judges I've been up [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=746.18s)]
*  I've been in front of have been city attorneys Dennis Herrera was the city [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=752.5799999999999s)]
*  attorney at the time and he held that position for a very long time so she [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=757.26s)]
*  moved sideways after less than two years at the district attorney's office to the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=761.26s)]
*  city attorney's office where she put together a portfolio involving child [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=764.5s)]
*  welfare and you know sort of juvenile offenders you know that sort of a thing [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=772.5s)]
*  again I would call it a pretty fluffy portfolio but something that's designed [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=779.34s)]
*  to give her something to talk about if she runs for office and so so for two or [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=784.8199999999999s)]
*  three years she spent her time there at the city attorney's office again by the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=788.86s)]
*  way all on the you know public employment she's never had a job in the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=792.42s)]
*  private sector ever ever and so I'm well Harris has been living on taxpayer money [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=796.9399999999999s)]
*  her entire sure entire her entire career that's correct she's never had a private [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=803.02s)]
*  sector job now let me pause for a second while she was doing some of these [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=807.9399999999999s)]
*  jobs she actually was doing multiple jobs on paper because Willie Brown one [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=814.54s)]
*  of the one of the positions that you get access to when you're the speaker and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=819.2199999999999s)]
*  then you pretty much continue to have a lot of access to over the years is the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=825.02s)]
*  ability to appoint people to patronage jobs and so before he you know kind of [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=829.8399999999999s)]
*  left the speaker's office he was able to appoint her to one of two commissions so [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=834.9399999999999s)]
*  she was on a taxpayer funded commission called the unemployment appeals board [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=841.66s)]
*  and so you hear appeals of denials of unemployment benefits that's a cushy [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=848.14s)]
*  part-time job which pays almost $100,000 salary you show up a couple of days a [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=854.38s)]
*  month and then he also got her appointed to a second sort of part-time job very [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=859.14s)]
*  part-time couple of days a month again called something called like the medical [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=867.86s)]
*  assistance commission which was dealing with medical contracts and and appeals [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=872.1400000000001s)]
*  over that and so over the years that she was taking a salary as first in Alameda [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=877.9000000000001s)]
*  County prosecutor and then a San Francisco County prosecutor she earned an [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=884.38s)]
*  additional over $400,000 over a five-year period from these low show slash no show [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=888.58s)]
*  jobs he also got her a BMW as a gift and so Willie Brown gave Kamala Harris a [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=896.94s)]
*  BMW he gave her a BMW and he got her these extra hundreds of thousands of [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=905.5s)]
*  dollars of jobs and to give you some perspective the salary of a prosecutor [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=909.7s)]
*  around that time was about a hundred thousand dollars so she basically got [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=913.3000000000001s)]
*  double or triple what her colleagues were getting so imagine the morale in [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=916.74s)]
*  the office when you're person sitting next to you is also dating the mayor and [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=921.1s)]
*  also is making hundreds of thousands of dollars more than you because getting a [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=926.54s)]
*  free BMW and getting a free BMW so she was marked out as privileged in her 20s [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=930.58s)]
*  and 30s very early on and that allowed her to leap over the career hurdles that [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=935.06s)]
*  those of us who work for a living in the private sector have to actually earn [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=941.34s)]
*  yeah right and I think it's and you know she's she's had to face these [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=945.14s)]
*  criticisms over time and she's become very glib and and good at deflecting [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=949.38s)]
*  yes the criticism but it's it's I don't think it's disputable that the extra [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=956.26s)]
*  income and more importantly the patronage that she enjoyed in her 20s and [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=961.78s)]
*  early 30s made her the person who's you know the Vice President United States [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=966.98s)]
*  today and seeking the top job not merit but influence peddling and using her [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=973.3s)]
*  female wiles and just all the sleaze and corruption that inevitably arises in a [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=981.78s)]
*  one-party state like California you know multiplied by by a hundred when you're [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=986.8199999999999s)]
*  dating the most you know powerful person there and even after she broke up with [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=991.8199999999999s)]
*  him as the story goes because she realized that he was never going to make [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=996.42s)]
*  her a wife she continued that strong relationship and to this day you know [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1001.02s)]
*  Willie Brown has endorsed her and is you know out there helping her raise money [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1006.34s)]
*  and so she had broken up with him by the time she ran for district attorney but he [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1011.46s)]
*  was instrumental in helping her raise hundreds of thousands of dollars and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1017.66s)]
*  eventually winning in that in that way Brown has a reputation for the last 60 [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1021.22s)]
*  years for a corruption I'm not alleging a specific crime he was a jailhouse [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1027.1s)]
*  lawyer for years representing radicals of various kinds but he he has a reputation [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1033.1s)]
*  for corruption is that fair to say oh absolutely and even specifically in this [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1041.5s)]
*  district attorney race so I'll break that down for you so Terrence Hallinan [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1047.1399999999999s)]
*  was a mixed back he was the district attorney for you know the one who Kamala [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1054.22s)]
*  Harris replaced and so but he was tough on corruption okay so there was some [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1058.38s)]
*  corruption in the police department in San Francisco the SFPD had a scandal [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1068.38s)]
*  called fajita gate where some cops got into a beef with some street vendors [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1072.74s)]
*  over some fajitas it's kind of a silly beginning of the story but the end of [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1078.82s)]
*  that story is that Terrence Hallinan brought charges against the police chief [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1085.5s)]
*  his deputy and some other cops involved in this scandal okay well Willie Brown [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1091.2s)]
*  didn't like this you know he had put all these people basically basically [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1097.8999999999999s)]
*  everybody in the top jobs in San Francisco owed it in some way to Willie [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1101.74s)]
*  Brown was able to get stuff done in the city as a lobbyist and as a fixer and [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1106.22s)]
*  particularly for the real estate industry by controlling a lot of the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1111.5s)]
*  elected officials and the law enforcement in San Francisco there were [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1116.14s)]
*  corruption investigations that Terrence Hallinan was looking at regarding some [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1122.74s)]
*  of this power structure in San Francisco and so by replacing Terrence Hallinan [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1129.18s)]
*  Willie Brown through his agent of Kamala Harris was able to put an end to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1134.54s)]
*  some of these investigations these investigations were quietly dropped the [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1140.3799999999999s)]
*  fajita gate thing quietly went away the case collapsed and the police who were [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1144.46s)]
*  accused of wrongdoing were never held accountable but because of that [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1150.94s)]
*  investigation and indictments that were brought by Terrence Hallinan you know [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1155.06s)]
*  that began some friction that continued some friction the police were also [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1160.02s)]
*  frustrated at Hallinan's failure to take drug dealers off the streets so [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1164.34s)]
*  Willie Brown through that dent of getting his former mistress the DA job [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1169.6999999999998s)]
*  by helping her raise money getting her key endorsements from the socialites [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1177.22s)]
*  the Getty family and all the top families in San Francisco who backed her [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1181.3s)]
*  the founder of North Face and others. The Getty family would be the patrons of Gavin [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1186.3s)]
*  Newsom now the governor. Gavin Newsom's patrons and the patrons I mean I think [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1191.98s)]
*  they're supporters of Kamala Harris and others they've supported every major [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1195.82s)]

*  so so Willie Brown was able to put an end to pesky investigations into [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1226.8600000000001s)]

*  asked because she's on video pronouncing it Kamala and Kamala two different ways [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1340.68s)]
*  so I remember her putting the emphasis on the second syllable so it was a [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1347.24s)]
*  Kamala Kamala Kamala was how she pronounced it not Kamala not Kamala [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1352.98s)]
*  Kamala is actually how Indian Indians pronounce it the name derives from the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1357.72s)]
*  word for lotus in Sanskrit which is Komal so yeah and so you know that that [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1364.84s)]
*  is how you're supposed to pronounce it conventional name it's a it's a [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1372.3999999999999s)]
*  conventional name absolutely and it's a it's a it's a Brahmin she's a she's from [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1375.52s)]
*  a Brahmin family her mother is Brahmin and so you know high caste background I [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1380.8s)]
*  thought she was oppressed she's a shape-shifter like I said so although you [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1384.8s)]
*  know I saw an explanation in one of these liberal publications trying to [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1391.6s)]
*  explain how throughout the most of her career she's passed as African-American [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1395.32s)]
*  and not mixed race because of course not until Tiger Woods became prominent [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1400.04s)]
*  did people parse out their differences in their racial background so you know [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1406.8s)]
*  it was it was suggested that she had to pick one or the other early in her career [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1412.2s)]
*  and she largely identified as African-American and so she really focused [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1417.6399999999999s)]
*  on the African-American community in San Francisco she identified as African-American [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1422.12s)]
*  Did she live in a black neighborhood? Did she live in Hunters Point? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1426.36s)]
*  She did not live in Hunters Point. She lived in a nice condo in the South of Market in the ballpark area. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1428.76s)]
*  But she was quote focused on the African-American community. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1435.56s)]
*  She was focused on the African-American community. Now I've read just about everything that's [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1437.9599999999998s)]
*  written about her and back in that time period Willie Brown actually got one of [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1442.6799999999998s)]
*  his political clients and patrons to rent her her campaign headquarters in [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1447.4799999999998s)]
*  Bayview Hunters Point not where she lived and not where the courthouse is but she had her [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1453.8s)]
*  campaign headquarters in that African-American neighborhood at well below market rent from a connection of Willie Brown. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1458.6s)]
*  It's unbelievable. Yeah and it's pretty blatant. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1466.2s)]
*  Rewind just for one moment. She it's without it's not controversial to say because it's factual it's provable. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1468.84s)]
*  She has pronounced her own first name at least two different ways. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1476.9199999999998s)]
*  I think three or four different ways. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1480.44s)]
*  So if we can just like consider for a moment how weird that is. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1482.6s)]
*  You have a non-Anglo first name. Yeah. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1487.24s)]
*  Hermit. That's right. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1489.1599999999999s)]
*  Indian name I assume. It's been pronounced consistently. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1491.24s)]
*  Right. Since childhood. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1493.72s)]
*  By you because it's your name. That's my name. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1495.32s)]
*  Yeah and I have pretended to be different things over the years. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1497.8799999999999s)]
*  But how have you ever met anyone who's pronounced his or her own first name [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1501.24s)]
*  different ways over. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1506.84s)]
*  No I really haven't and it was striking to me [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1508.12s)]
*  when she was running for district attorneys when I first met her and I had you know I was new to [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1513.32s)]
*  San Francisco. I just moved to San Francisco in 2003. I'd been I came to California in 2000 and I [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1517.56s)]
*  you know during the dot-com boom and I went down to Silicon Valley. I practiced law there and then [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1523.4799999999998s)]
*  I moved to San Francisco in 2003. I was new to town so I had a friend from the South Asian Bar [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1527.9599999999998s)]
*  Association who'd practiced with her in the DA's office in Alameda County who was you know helping [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1533.0s)]
*  her with her DA run. So I went to this fundraiser. I was new to town and you know Kamala Harris [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1537.48s)]
*  walks into the fundraiser. It was all Indian Americans at this particular fundraiser and so [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1543.32s)]
*  she was you know she was all business no nonsense strides into the room wearing a designer outfit [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1548.2s)]
*  well beyond her means as a district attorney assistant district attorney or at that time city [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1555.0s)]
*  attorney employee like foreign chills you know strides confidently into the room and begins [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1559.32s)]
*  telling us why she's going to be the better candidate than Terrence Hallinan who was running [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1565.32s)]
*  for re-election and I recall from that meeting you know she was really focused on process. She [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1569.72s)]
*  didn't really have a policy difference with Terrence Hallinan. She is also always painted [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1574.6799999999998s)]
*  herself as a progressive but tough on crime but her progressive prosecutor okay so she talked a [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1580.2s)]
*  lot about how the computers in the district attorney's office were outdated and you know [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1587.8799999999999s)]
*  we really needed to professionalize the office. Who could argue with that right? Of course the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1592.6s)]
*  district attorney's office in a major American city should have up-to-date computers. I mean I [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1597.0s)]
*  had them in my law firm practice and so that sounded good and you know she also criticized [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1601.3999999999999s)]
*  Hallinan for being soft on crime which in retrospect is not fair because she had a much [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1606.52s)]
*  worse record than him in prosecuting violent crime but I'll get to that but you know she really [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1611.9599999999998s)]
*  portrayed herself as just being the younger more competent liberal but tough on crime prosecutor [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1620.04s)]
*  and so she was planning to prosecute marijuana and drug offenses. She was planning to prosecute [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1627.6399999999999s)]
*  you know these quality of life crimes that Hallinan allegedly wasn't prosecuting and so that was her [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1634.36s)]
*  selling point in this fundraiser but when I saw her in other settings you know she didn't identify [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1640.68s)]
*  with the Indian American community at all and so I saw her in South Asian Bar Association events [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1648.2s)]
*  after she became the district attorney and otherwise and so when she came into an event [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1653.64s)]
*  where there were Indian Americans there like a South Asian lawyers event she was all you know [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1658.04s)]
*  namaste and you know all of that but you never saw that outside that setting right? She didn't do [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1662.1200000000001s)]
*  that in Hunter's Point. She didn't do any namaste's at all. There was no namaste in Hunter's Point. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1668.2s)]
*  Right. That would have been hilarious. No. So that's fake and I immediately saw that when I saw her [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1673.72s)]
*  in more than one setting that this woman is just pandering to whoever is in front of her which is [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1682.36s)]
*  of course you and I've been around a lot of politicians over the years. That's a common theme [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1686.28s)]
*  in politics right but the extent to which she was willing to just adopt an abandoned persona. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1690.04s)]
*  Well it's the self-righteousness too. I mean you know of course every politician panders. I think [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1696.04s)]
*  people pander to each other. It's all very common and very human but when caught you know you don't [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1700.44s)]
*  scream at the other person and call that person a racist for noticing which is exactly her response. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1707.64s)]
*  I mean Trump made that point. It was a totally fair point. I thought she was Indian now she's black. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1712.52s)]
*  Well sounds like he had reason to say that. All of a sudden shut up racist. Absolutely. Well let [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1716.6000000000001s)]
*  me pick up on that for a second. So it's been really striking in this campaign for president [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1722.44s)]
*  and even when she ran for president in 2019 and 2020 how she's very self-righteous about being [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1727.96s)]
*  in law enforcement and you know a top cop and a border cop and just like this law enforcement icon [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1735.56s)]
*  but she actually began her career in politics by breaking the law on multiple occasions and so this [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1743.0s)]
*  dates back even to before she ran for the district attorney position. In 2000, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1749.64s)]
*  Willie Brown asked her to take a break from her job at the city attorney's office, take a little [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1756.52s)]
*  leave of absence and do some work for Amos Brown, this notorious pastor who was running for reelection [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1763.0s)]
*  for the board of supervisors and Amos Brown was representing that African-American community and [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1772.84s)]
*  he was one of Willie Brown's people right and so she had no background in politics or anything but [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1779.6399999999999s)]
*  you know he thought well this is a good way for you to learn the ropes of how a campaign is run [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1785.8s)]
*  and it is a good way. Volunteering for a campaign is a good way to do that. She wasn't a volunteer [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1789.8799999999999s)]
*  though. That's the key point. She was paid as a political consultant by Amos Brown's campaign [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1794.44s)]
*  but she never registered under city law which requires all political consultants who are paid [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1800.76s)]
*  by a campaign more than a thousand dollars to register and so she was paid I think almost [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1806.6s)]
*  ten thousand dollars during this time she worked there. She never registered. She was called out [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1813.8s)]
*  on it and she skated. She explained she didn't know the rules and you know she hadn't really [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1818.4399999999998s)]
*  intended anything and so I think a fine or some penalty was paid at that point and that was the [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1825.8s)]
*  beginning of simply giving the middle finger to the law by Kamala Harris. She got herself [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1830.6s)]
*  embroiled in a much bigger scandal when she ran for district attorney. So in San Francisco like [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1839.3999999999999s)]
*  many of our liberal cities in California there's campaign finance matching funds that are available [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1844.6s)]
*  but there's also a benefit that you get if you agree to voluntarily cap your raising and spending. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1851.1599999999999s)]
*  At the time for mayor I think it was a little bit higher but for district attorney and mayor [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1857.48s)]
*  it might have been the same. It was two hundred and eleven thousand dollars so if you agreed to cap [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1862.44s)]
*  your raising and spending at two hundred and eleven thousand dollars in 2003 you got a statement [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1867.08s)]
*  published in the voter guide that's mailed to all the almost half a million voters in San [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1873.72s)]
*  Francisco registered voters saying that you had voluntarily agreed to confine yourself to that [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1878.52s)]
*  spending cap. So it's like a level playing field and it's a little bit of a gold star that you're [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1883.4s)]
*  agreeing not to engage in corruption, wasteful spending, cronyism by raising money from all [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1888.92s)]
*  kinds of unknown sources. So she agreed to that. She filed a piece of paper, she signed it under [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1894.2800000000002s)]
*  penalty of perjury saying I Kamala Harris agree to this voluntary spending limit. Most of the other [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1899.16s)]
*  candidates in the race and candidates for mayor during that race they also agreed to that spending [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1906.3600000000001s)]
*  limit. Okay so most of the candidates running for office in California, in San Francisco rather, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1911.08s)]
*  agreed to that spending limit. Well it turns out that Kamala Harris who by the way started out in [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1916.4399999999998s)]
*  this campaign third behind her boss Terrence Hallinan who was in the lead and then a guy named [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1922.6799999999998s)]
*  Vic Fazio who was a former prosecutor then defense attorney who was going to be the hard on crime guy [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1929.72s)]
*  he was eventually endorsed by the republicans in San Francisco. So she was third, she was the [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1936.92s)]
*  underdog and so she quickly was just getting no traction at first so she realized she was going [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1942.04s)]
*  to have to really supercharge her spending. Willie Brown helped her with this. Willie Brown also [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1946.3600000000001s)]
*  helped raise money for independent expenditures to support her as well. So it's a funny story but you [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1951.16s)]
*  know one of her one of her campaign themes was that she was going to be tough on drugs, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1960.1200000000001s)]
*  tough on marijuana and back in 2003 marijuana wasn't the recreational use of marijuana was not [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1965.64s)]
*  legal in California and so she was gonna be tough on pot. So apparently some pot activists who [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1972.1200000000001s)]
*  didn't like this you know they were pouring over the campaign finance records and it's a pot activist [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1980.2s)]
*  who realized that Kamala Harris had raised over $300,000 and had spent over $300,000. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1985.64s)]
*  So this person went and let the other campaigns know they filed an ethics complaint against her [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1990.9199999999998s)]
*  and at the end of the election she had spent over $600,000 so triple the amount that she was allowed [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=1998.4399999999998s)]
*  but thanks to hiring a good lawyer and making the excuse that oh the form changed I didn't really [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2007.8799999999999s)]
*  understand the meaning of this so please lift the cap she got the San Francisco Ethics Commission [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2013.56s)]
*  and by the way many of those people on the Ethics Commission owed their positions to [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2019.32s)]
*  Willie Brown. She got them to look the other way on this gross violation it's a crime by the way [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2024.2s)]
*  it could have been she could have been prosecuted for a misdemeanor had she been properly held [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2029.8s)]
*  accountable for this significant campaign finance violation and anybody else would have but the [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2036.36s)]
*  Ethics Commission simply lifted the cap which is not in the statute so instead of disqualifying her [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2042.84s)]
*  which would have been the normal punishment and prosecuting her she simply got away with it. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2049.16s)]
*  So in her first race for elected office she ignored the campaign finance limits she used [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2054.52s)]
*  corrupt patronage from her former lover to raise the money necessary to do the glossy ads I've got [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2064.68s)]
*  several examples here she did more mailers and all of the other candidates she had independent [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2071.48s)]
*  expenditures on her behalf and she simply was able to outspend and blow through these limits. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2076.04s)]
*  And so you got an ad from her oh yeah I have a lot of this material here from 2003 and so [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2081.4s)]
*  this is all the people who endorsed her and this is all the main political machine there in in [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2090.44s)]
*  San Francisco now one of those guys in jail for he's a former state senator Leland Yee he was [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2096.36s)]
*  later indicted for the Reverend Cecil Williams Reverend Cecil Williams and keeps involved with [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2103.32s)]
*  Jim Jones but maybe I'm misremembering that there's a lot of blast from the past over there [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2109.32s)]
*  because she raised so much money she was able to send multiple of these you know big glossy mailers [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2117.6400000000003s)]
*  she's today's vote's voice for justice yeah today's voice for justice Kamala Harris for [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2126.1200000000003s)]
*  district attorney you know Aaron Peskin Fiona Ma you know some of the shadiest politicians [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2131.16s)]
*  in California are here on her endorsement list of course Willie Brown she was you know she [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2138.12s)]
*  checked all the boxes to get the gay community on board the Asian community on board you know [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2145.56s)]
*  she really put the coalition together thanks to the mentorship she enjoyed here is assemblyman [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2149.96s)]
*  Mark Leno no one is better prepared to lead our district attorney's office in this new era [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2156.44s)]
*  than Kamala Harris well they're actually almost every prosecutor in that office was better prepared [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2161.56s)]
*  Terrence Hallinan was better prepared Vic Fazio was better prepared so by simply outspending and [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2167.16s)]
*  violating the campaign finance cap she was able to to win this election she she got it into the [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2173.8s)]
*  runoff and then she was able to win in the runoff against her boss so it was a pretty incredible [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2180.92s)]
*  upset this is another one of her glossy glossy mayors glossy mailers so she's a veteran prosecutor [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2187.4s)]
*  with 13 years of courtroom experience and a 90 conviction rate she actually had only been a [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2197.96s)]
*  prosecutor for 10 years and her conviction rate I mean you can manipulate any statistic you [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2202.92s)]
*  want by simply changing the numerator and the denominator and so you know it's pretty incredible [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2210.68s)]
*  that the birth of this meteoric career comes out of multiple campaign finance violations [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2218.7599999999998s)]
*  so she won she won that race I mean one of the mailers from the other side [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2228.68s)]
*  is a mailer from the from the tenants union which was supporting Kamala Harris sorry sorry [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2235.7200000000003s)]
*  supporting Terrence Hallinan and they pointed out that she had committed another violation [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2243.48s)]
*  and that is soliciting money from landlords who she was supposed to be regulating in her job at [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2248.52s)]
*  the city attorney's office so one of her jobs in the city attorney's office involved you know sort [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2255.32s)]
*  of the welfare of people who were on public assistance and that included people in the SRO [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2260.36s)]
*  single residence housing and section 8 housing I mean it's it's a lot of our residents are on [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2268.28s)]
*  public assistance and live in this kind of housing and so she happily took tens of thousands of [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2275.08s)]
*  dollars from slumlords who she was supposed to be regulating in this campaign and the tenants union [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2281.1600000000003s)]
*  there's a there's a mailer in here I have somewhere that talks about her taking money from the roach [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2287.96s)]
*  motels and you know they were able to put that one mailer out but it ended up not not convincing [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2292.76s)]
*  San Francisco has more roach motels in any city in the United States I think per square foot it's [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2299.4s)]

*  to the public so how she did that was she had a um a door hanger and those of us who were involved [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2421.88s)]
*  in politics you know you go walk doors you knock on the doors and you hang a door hanger with your [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2428.76s)]
*  material so she replaced her door hanger with this uh kamala harris folded door hanger and then in the [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2433.0s)]
*  tiniest possible print would you like my glasses yeah i'll put mine on let me show you i mean [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2441.7200000000003s)]
*  due to an error by the kamala harris campaign the voter information pamphlet indicates that the [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2450.12s)]
*  campaign has agreed to voluntary limit campaign spending this is incorrect we take responsibility [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2455.3199999999997s)]
*  for this error now this is printed on the top of this hanger so you hang it on the door [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2460.2799999999997s)]
*  there's no way the normal wage slave coming home from their actual job where they worked you know [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2465.3199999999997s)]
*  a full day unlike kamala harris uh would go and let people who are not getting willy brown you mean [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2472.2s)]
*  people norm those of us taxpayers who have private sector jobs you come home and the first thing you [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2478.44s)]
*  do with this annoying piece of crap is tear it off right so this is the part that would fall to [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2483.4s)]
*  the ground when you tear it off and maybe clutch your mail and take it and nobody read this [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2488.44s)]
*  like three point disclosure on this thing and so because her patronage boyfriend had fixed it for [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2493.24s)]
*  her she got away with this nobody else would be able to get away with this today i can guarantee [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2501.64s)]
*  you and so no shame and that's how she got her start in politics by by breaking the rules and so [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2506.04s)]
*  i mentioned to you these no-show jobs as well she had the lowest attendance record of any of the [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2515.48s)]
*  attendees of these two commissions either so on top of having a job where she got paid hundreds [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2520.52s)]
*  of thousands of dollars to do very little she didn't even show up and do that but there's one [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2525.16s)]
*  more fact about this you know in the city attorney's office they had to keep time sheets now you you know [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2530.6s)]
*  a lot of lawyers you've you've you've gotten bills from lawyers uh we yes i have we uh we billed by [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2535.96s)]
*  the hour and we're supposed to record our time in tenths of an hour okay um so in the city attorney's [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2543.08s)]
*  office you recorded your time that way and so someone in one of these various campaigns she's [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2549.88s)]
*  been in over the years did a public records act request for these hours and her predecessor in [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2555.8s)]
*  her job at the city attorney's office was a now uh i think retired or semi-retired judge [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2561.4s)]
*  katherine feinstein the daughter of diane feinstein the former united state senator [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2569.56s)]
*  so feinstein had the job and then kamala harris had the job so if you compare their hours you see [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2574.6800000000003s)]
*  that kamala harris i think worked one day over eight hours in all the three years that she worked [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2579.56s)]
*  there diane feinstein's daughter regularly worked long normal lawyer hours she worked one day over [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2584.2000000000003s)]
*  eight hours in how long three years yeah and she's just lazy yeah and there were a number of days [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2590.76s)]
*  where she had block eight hours phone calls research something eight hours so she didn't [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2597.4s)]
*  work full days in that job that's that's what any supervisor i'm a supervisor about 25 lawyers if i [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2604.28s)]
*  saw time sheets like that i would call that person and i put them on probation because they clearly [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2611.0s)]
*  aren't working a full day's worth of work they're block billing they're putting down time they're [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2615.48s)]
*  they're doing a lot of admin time days and days of admin time meaning i didn't work that day i read [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2620.2s)]
*  the newspaper i did continuing legal education i did some you know background research she did not [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2625.64s)]
*  work those full days that's a that's what any supervising lawyer being honest would tell you [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2632.2s)]
*  so that's pretty striking because as it is you're you know only expected to work you know sort of [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2638.68s)]
*  nine to five unlike those of us who are you know working in the private sector working much harder [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2645.4s)]
*  to make a living and keep our jobs yeah there's no such accountability in in the jobs that she's [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2650.36s)]
*  held and so when she ran for da she claimed i've tried hundreds and hundreds of serious felony [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2656.52s)]
*  cases and she got busted by the tenants union saying actually you've tried 10 cases and then [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2662.36s)]
*  she had to sort of over the years own that maybe she was affiliated with hundreds of cases she [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2668.84s)]
*  didn't actually try them and look as you get more senior as a lawyer you don't try every case i get [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2675.6400000000003s)]
*  it but in those early years of your career if you're billing yourself as a top cop and a top [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2682.52s)]
*  prosecutor normally people do but that is not connell harris you have an excellent memory well [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2687.56s)]
*  in general but for this period 20 years ago and you were around comal harris living in that world [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2696.52s)]
*  matter all that when you see comal harris now does she seem like the same person to you so this is [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2704.2s)]
*  interesting tucker i got the impression from the first time i met comal harris when she strode [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2710.6s)]
*  into my friend's apartment in that small fundraiser of an extremely confident competent articulate [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2715.8s)]
*  person now i don't think she's a great lawyer and i think she's hardly had much courtroom experience [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2725.24s)]
*  but she exuded competence and confidence and the comal harris you saw as vice president of the [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2730.6s)]
*  united states seems to be a completely different person inarticulate lacking confidence [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2739.7999999999997s)]
*  um almost like dazed or medicated in some way and i don't know that of course i'm just telling you [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2748.12s)]
*  that the impression of somebody extremely competent and confident and able to talk about [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2756.12s)]
*  their record their recent record even falsely with a degree of confidence and bravado [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2761.4799999999996s)]
*  there's a couple of dynamics there first of all i think the record that she's been running on is [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2770.3599999999997s)]
*  way in the past and so it's become part of her own personal hagiography that she's you know [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2775.56s)]
*  this brilliant accomplished stunning you know top cop who people criminals quake in their boots to [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2781.48s)]
*  see her that's not true but you know it's she's adopted it but it's also way in the past but [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2788.2799999999997s)]
*  secondly it feels like she's not able to articulate herself there seems to be a veil of [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2793.56s)]
*  inability to string together complete and coherent sentences seems afraid to me [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2801.32s)]
*  and you saw it in the opening moments of her debate with trump where i thought she did she did well [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2808.04s)]
*  as the debate continued but in the opening moments it's worth looking at the tape again [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2813.48s)]
*  you see her eyes this woman's terrified there maybe it's imposter syndrome i don't know what it is [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2818.2s)]
*  but can you explain well imposter syndrome is somebody who is successful has reached certain [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2824.92s)]
*  levels of at least outward appearance as a success but yet is plagued by self-doubt that [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2829.56s)]
*  maybe i don't belong here right what am i doing here i feel like i'm an imposter how did i find [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2836.84s)]
*  myself here like a bad dream yes like those dreams we all have before the exam that you know you go [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2841.4s)]
*  in and you haven't studied and it's the right or you're in your pajamas or something you're in [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2847.72s)]
*  your pajamas or whatever and so but it isn't one it can happen to any of us and we all freeze [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2851.56s)]
*  sometimes in tense situations but we've all seen her on the national and international stage [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2858.2s)]
*  doing increasingly incoherent word salad statements we've just seen the the incident [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2863.3199999999997s)]
*  with 60 minutes substituting a completely incoherent answer that she gave to a question [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2869.7999999999997s)]
*  with something else that she did in another part of the interview or maybe even taped afterwards [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2877.48s)]
*  who knows i have no idea how 60 minutes came up with that but 60 minutes got caught lying about [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2882.2s)]
*  the interview 60 minutes has been caught blatantly fixing her incoherence for her and you know that [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2886.6s)]
*  has been the case with the mainstream media i think this is a theme throughout her career [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2892.92s)]
*  dating back to that 2000 2003 as she gotten her leg up in life by shortcuts not by meritocracy [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2896.92s)]
*  and then she finds herself in a position that is beyond her capabilities and then she has to lie [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2908.8399999999997s)]
*  and exaggerate to maintain that position and get to the next level but with the assistance of the [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2913.96s)]
*  democratic machine in california and she to be fair to her she's not the only person i mean gavin [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2919.8s)]
*  newsome is another example of somebody who has faked his way to the top um javier becerra who's [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2925.32s)]
*  in the cabinet today is a guy who had basically one year of legal experience before he became the [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2932.68s)]
*  attorney general of california and so california's machine has produced a number of underqualified [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2937.8s)]
*  and overconfident duds but this person is seeking the top job of the united states with with an [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2945.6400000000003s)]
*  exaggerated record with a tattered history of sorted ways that she got to where she is of numerous [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2952.1200000000003s)]
*  legal violations that could have resulted in criminal prosecution just the campaign finance [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2960.28s)]
*  violations alone and so you know i can understand why somebody might have an imposter syndrome [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2965.0s)]
*  and that's their history now the sad thing is california used to be famous for producing things [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2971.48s)]
*  from the world's best ag to aerospace to great movies and now it's like failed light rail projects [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2976.6s)]
*  in kamala harris and gavin newsome and and gaslighting gaslighting the voters on so many levels [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2983.2400000000002s)]
*  so i mean kamala harris promised to san francisco voters to get elected that she was going to be [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2989.08s)]
*  tough on crime the murder rate skyrocketed during her years as a district attorney and why did that [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=2994.28s)]
*  happen well gangs in the whole bay area they do talk to each other i was talking to a prosecutor [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3001.5600000000004s)]
*  in her office a couple of days ago in preparation for our interview and they and this prosecutor [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3005.96s)]
*  said harmeet these criminals you may think oh they're like you know criminals are on the margins of [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3012.44s)]
*  society they're subhuman no they're very smart they communicate with each other they know that [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3016.44s)]
*  if you are doing certain crimes in san francisco you're going to get a pass if you're doing drunk [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3021.56s)]
*  driving in san francisco you're going to get a pass during kamala harris's tenure if you did it [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3029.08s)]
*  in alameda county san matteo county marin county you would get prosecuted so guess what the [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3033.96s)]
*  criminals came to san francisco to do their drug dealing to do their break-ins their hot prowl [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3039.32s)]
*  burglaries their low-level offenses kamala harris was notorious for being hard on gun [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3045.0s)]
*  possession by legal taxpayers but extremely lenient to the point of multiple [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3051.16s)]
*  criminals who possess guns committing murders after she let them off with a slap on the wrist [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3060.12s)]
*  or no punishment at all so there was a double standard there in her prosecution and that's a [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3064.92s)]
*  theme throughout the state where you know they've legalized stealing you can steal from stores and [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3070.12s)]
*  so nothing no one can do anything about it but any store owner who tries to defend himself against [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3076.92s)]
*  violence or homeowner who tries the same will be prosecuted that's right why what is that impulse [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3082.52s)]
*  that anarcho tyranny where does that come from well it's there's two aspects of it first of all [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3088.2799999999997s)]
*  it's treating the successful people in society as criminals and putting them in a box i mean i'm [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3093.72s)]
*  a legal gun owner and you know the scrutiny you have to jump through to get a gun legally [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3100.04s)]
*  and california is incredible but if you are an illegal alien you get a free pass for a sanctuary [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3105.96s)]
*  we were a sanctuary city before we were a sanctuary state so kamala harris has long been in the camp of [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3114.44s)]
*  protecting those folks by simply looking the other way breaking federal law in other words breaking [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3119.96s)]
*  federal law and how is that then not insurrection by the way i mean i think it's look you know the [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3125.48s)]
*  criminals have guns and they get away with it but how is it not i mean she's always running around [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3131.88s)]
*  calling all the j6 all the diabetic grandmothers languishing in prison insurrectionist but how [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3136.6s)]
*  is it not insurrection against the united states of america to allow foreigners in your country [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3141.56s)]
*  in your state against federal law well i completely agree i mean it's even worse than that there was a [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3147.72s)]
*  interesting situation where a criminal committed a crime in san francisco while she was a district [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3153.72s)]
*  attorney and that criminal was free to commit that crime because she had pushed for that criminal [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3160.6s)]
*  to be part of a program of rehabilitation so there was a rehabilitation program where if you did some [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3166.7599999999998s)]
*  job training as someone arrested for a serious crime you could avoid prison time well an illegal [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3172.6s)]
*  alien is not entitled to hold a job so san francisco taxpayers california taxpayers under [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3180.52s)]
*  kamala harris's leadership were paying for jobs training for illegal alien criminals to get out [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3186.92s)]
*  of their criminal sentences and then they weren't even eligible to go on to hold those jobs so one [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3195.0s)]
*  of those people committed a serious violent crime shattering the skull of a taxpayer in san francisco [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3201.56s)]
*  and he was able to do that because kamala harris signed him up for jobs training when he isn't [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3207.48s)]
*  illegally allowed under united states law i mean you clearly are trying to overthrow the society [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3212.84s)]
*  you know you're pandering to a particular element of society i think eventually democrats have [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3218.36s)]
*  wanted to legalize all of the illegal aliens in the country that's not a secret now they tried to [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3222.68s)]
*  lie about it in the past but today that's a campaign promise of hers that she wants to [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3227.56s)]
*  legalize all of these illegal aliens in the country and get their votes so it's a long-term [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3232.6s)]
*  vote recruitment program by these folks but look you can't forget the detail so she's the [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3237.96s)]
*  insurrectionist i mean she's the insurrectionist and overthrow the united states government and [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3244.68s)]
*  system and destroyed democracy and invalidate our founding documents our core freedoms i mean [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3249.72s)]
*  that's all those are all species of insurrection that would seem to me she sounds like a criminal [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3256.76s)]
*  well she's broken a lot of laws over the years just in the you know white collar laws but she's [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3261.64s)]
*  enabled hundreds if not thousands of criminals to go on to commit violent crimes and even even [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3266.6s)]
*  fatalities i mean there there are police officers in san francisco who lost their lives because [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3273.3199999999997s)]
*  kamala harris was soft on the criminals who went on to kill them as one of their dozens of offenses [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3279.0s)]
*  there's a long trail of victims in san francisco and now california who have suffered because of [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3287.0s)]
*  kamala harris's soft on crime policies and she's lied about it and gotten away with it and it's [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3294.28s)]
*  kind of incredible that someone who failed who increased the murder rate by many percentage [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3300.0400000000004s)]
*  points who who prosecuted almost no violent crimes in san francisco during the many years she was a [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3305.8s)]
*  district attorney she she failed up to becoming the attorney general where she went on to violate [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3311.32s)]
*  the rights of criminal defendants on a much more massive scale but even before that tucker what [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3318.68s)]
*  are the interesting incidents is in the last two years of her race of her tenure as district attorney [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3325.24s)]
*  she was embroiled in a major scandal involving the systematic violation of criminal defendants [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3332.7599999999998s)]
*  rights and in san francisco in the drug lab there was a drug technician who was supposed to test [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3338.3599999999997s)]
*  the drugs and this person was sampling the drugs taking them home and sampling them and also making [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3344.52s)]
*  numerous errors this was an open secret in the district attorney's office so after you know [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3352.12s)]
*  people mentioned it on numerous occasions judges chastised the district attorney's office [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3357.64s)]
*  eventually a top manager in the office sent a cover your ass email to kamala harris saying hey [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3362.7599999999998s)]
*  by the way i think the the head of this drug lab section is actually taking drugs and regularly [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3369.8s)]
*  violating protocols and handling evidence kamala harris instead of doing her immediate duty as a [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3376.92s)]
*  district attorney to inform all defense counsel in all the cases in which this lab technician [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3383.4s)]
*  had handled the drugs for testing she sat on it for a period of three months and it only came out [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3389.88s)]
*  not through kamala harris disclosing it and so the judge in that case christine mezulo [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3397.8s)]
*  excoriated the district attorney's office now by this time kamala harris had been the district [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3403.08s)]
*  attorney for six years in the six years she was a district attorney she created no protocol [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3407.2400000000002s)]
*  for disclosing to defense counsel this what's called a brady violation a violation which is [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3412.84s)]
*  so massive that you have to disclose to the other side that there's been a potential due process [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=3418.92s)]

*  multiple jurisdictions in the united states have ruled that journalists going undercover [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4344.120000000001s)]

*  so under the rule both people have to consent to the taping now the exception is if it's in a public [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4365.32s)]
*  place which most of these tapings arguably all of these tapings in california were made in a public [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4370.759999999999s)]

*  david remains on the hook paying all this money to defend himself from the charge of doing journalism [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4412.76s)]
*  what penalties does he face he faces years in prison if he's convicted did kamala harris [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4420.5199999999995s)]

*  out that he is very credibly accused by a woman who's told her story to multiple publications [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4905.64s)]
*  of publicly slapping her at the canned film festival where this lady had been invited in [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4916.68s)]
*  the face so hard that she spun around from it and he did it because after a couple of cocktails he [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4924.6s)]
*  was apparently very jealous you know she went up to a valet to try to jump the line a little bit [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4931.08s)]
*  after waiting over an hour after the film festival got out and was trying to tip him to let them cut [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4935.16s)]
*  the line and he got jealous of this and publicly assaulted her hit her in the face hit her in the [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4941.5599999999995s)]
*  face and she immediately reported this to multiple friends of hers and then the law this is considered [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4948.92s)]
*  what we call an excited utterance so if you tell somebody something horrible that happened to you [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4954.92s)]
*  in the immediate seconds and minutes afterwards it has assigned a higher degree of credibility [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4959.8s)]
*  under hearsay law than otherwise yeah right because you know people are more likely to be [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4965.0s)]
*  truthful when they've got the adrenaline running through them in the moment of what exactly just [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4969.96s)]
*  happened so because of the dynamics of the situation she allegedly got into the car the [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4973.72s)]
*  the valets were shocked by this disgusting scene and you know let them go he forced his way into [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4980.92s)]
*  the same car so while she's in the car with this person the story goes that the Daily Mail has [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4987.24s)]
*  reported she called somebody she knew back in the United States and told them what was happening [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4992.2s)]
*  then she also reported it to a couple of friends of hers and so her story has apparently been [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=4997.24s)]
*  consistent according to the witnesses who the press has interviewed and that's one instance [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5001.72s)]
*  but the more shocking part of the story is that this woman recounts that Emhoff casually told her [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5008.5199999999995s)]
*  in the days or weeks before this incident because she was she was being what she called love bombed [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5016.84s)]

*  must have come up how did you get divorced like what happened to your marriage and apparently he [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5034.2s)]
*  told her that he had he had been accused by his elementary school teacher's babysitter [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5041.160000000001s)]
*  of getting her pregnant his elementary school age children's children's teacher sorry correct [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5052.68s)]

*  serving as their after-school babysitter slash nanny tutor whatever you want to call it getting [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5063.64s)]

*  maybe through a miscarriage you know that's the accusations he's through violence hit a woman in [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5082.92s)]
*  the face yeah exactly exactly and so um now american told her this he told her this casually [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5087.8s)]
*  so american media being what it is today um you know kind of a big deal the vice [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5096.76s)]
*  president's husband who's redefining masculinity and lecturing is all about bigotry all the time [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5103.88s)]
*  sanctimonious little prick that guy is um that guy is accused of hitting a woman in the face [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5111.88s)]

*  in law school i took 40 hours of training and become a became a counselor for victims of [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5123.08s)]
*  domestic violence i've gone to court for many women who have been abused and it's a it's you [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5128.6s)]
*  know science behind it that someone who hits a woman once in a public place in the face in the [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5134.44s)]
*  face in front of hundreds of witnesses in a line this person has done it in other circumstances i [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5140.76s)]
*  would i would i would virtually guarantee that it doesn't happen one time it's it's the culmination [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5147.72s)]
*  of pattern of years of experience another story has come out about doug amhoff's conduct at his [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5153.72s)]
*  own law firm venables where he apparently hired a lady to be his paralegal or secretary sitting on [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5159.400000000001s)]
*  his desk and her name was katya and to the point that other partners other male partners in [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5167.0s)]
*  in the office demanded their own katya demanded their own paralegal to sit on on their desk and [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5173.0s)]
*  this katya episode happened during the time that kamala harris was engaged to be married to [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5180.68s)]
*  doug amhoff she may have come into contact with this so the implication is the implication is [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5186.52s)]
*  he uses women as objects and doesn't treat them as equals and doesn't respect them i think that's [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5191.0s)]
*  fair probably not too surprising that he's like some power feminist now right well i think have [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5196.120000000001s)]
*  you ever met a male feminist who treats women well i haven't i once should always be suspicious [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5202.12s)]
*  of the male feminists that's my experience i've never met anybody more likely to hit a woman in [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5206.84s)]
*  the face or cause miscares than a male feminist i mean they're all abusers i've never met one who [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5211.72s)]
*  was not an abuser of women ever well what concerns me as a 30-year-plus activist on domestic violence [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5216.04s)]
*  is the prospect that somebody like that might be in the white house i think that's very scary [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5225.96s)]
*  and that the president of the united states might be an enabler of somebody like that that really [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5232.28s)]
*  bothers me well yeah what so that's the obvious question i mean these sound like these are this [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5238.92s)]
*  is not brett cavnaugh stuff these are i think it's very credible these stories are resourced with [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5244.68s)]
*  multiple sources and i think there's probably more that's going to come out i won't be surprised [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5250.36s)]
*  and this is an actual human being making these allegations actual human being making these [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5255.72s)]
*  allegations and you know they're making them to a person who has a history of looking the other way [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5259.64s)]
*  enabling being the beneficiary of well so that's the question common harris is a huge defender of [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5268.52s)]
*  women all the all the girls are voting for because she's for women what's her position on these [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5273.72s)]
*  she hasn't commented and you know when she was running for district attorney i've looked at her [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5279.08s)]
*  resume at the time and she listed as one of her credentials being the being the chairman of the [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5282.6s)]
*  board of a domestic violence advocacy organization she has promoted herself so perfect she has [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5287.56s)]
*  promoted herself as a prosecutor who's been you know protecting women from sex trafficking and [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5294.52s)]
*  human trafficking and i can tell you like i mean just a quality of life issue in san francisco [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5299.8s)]
*  where i've lived for the last almost 25 years now is that you can't get elected in san francisco [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5305.4800000000005s)]
*  without checking the boxes of different constituencies and one of those is the [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5313.48s)]
*  chinese american chinatown community which includes a lot of organized crime and sex [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5317.879999999999s)]

*  sex trafficking dens in san in chinatown i walked through chinatown on my way to work before it got [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5330.44s)]

*  it's and i it's tragic because it's a beautiful city most beautiful it's a it's like it's like [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5345.32s)]

*  she really allowed sex trafficking to flourish she was notorious as a prosecutor for only taking up [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5357.879999999999s)]
*  the slam dunk cases and even there she had a very low prosecution rate in her later years and so [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5365.72s)]
*  i mean if you just descend you know to 25 000 feet she's this member of the law enforcement [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5372.68s)]

*  bend that you see on every corner in san francisco the gangs of young criminals who come into the [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5396.92s)]
*  city to rip it off you can trace all of that back to kamala harris's leadership when she ran for [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5402.12s)]
*  district attorney in 2003 she proudly noted that she was one of the prosecutors one of the few [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5408.12s)]
*  prosecutors who is opposed to a proposed law a proposition that would allow prosecutors to treat [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5414.76s)]
*  juveniles who committed violent crimes prosecute them as adults she was opposed to that she wanted [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5423.64s)]
*  to protect the juvenile violent criminals and the people who would go on inevitably to create to [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5429.56s)]
*  commit greater and greater crimes so she's been soft on crime at the same time calling herself a [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5436.76s)]
*  top prosecutor all these years i mean she has been open about what she is in many ways but you [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5443.96s)]
*  know packaged it in very slick terms and because she's a woman and because she's a minority and [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5449.96s)]
*  because so much of our culture panders to this identity politics she's been able to somehow get [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5455.88s)]
*  away with the marxist substance of what she has been peddling she's a minority it's hilarious i [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5463.08s)]
*  mean unless you're hispanic you are a minority in california no matter what you look like or where [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5469.64s)]
*  your ancestors are from right i mean in a state like california where there's not a white majority [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5474.52s)]
*  can you still is this still meaningful to call yourself a minority well you know in san francisco [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5479.72s)]
*  and in these circles somehow there's this cognitive dissonance about it right and you know what's even [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5487.400000000001s)]
*  i bring i come back to amos brown who she did her first known violation of the campaign finance laws [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5495.24s)]

*  this is this is the administration and you know this is normal no one even comments on it it seems [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5555.96s)]
*  yeah things are totally out of control there's no doubt about that how does she get from attorney [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5562.28s)]
*  general of california to the senate well again it was the machine politics of of california and [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5568.5199999999995s)]
*  you know in california there's usually a game of musical chairs and so one politician is anointed [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5576.68s)]
*  for the next office and then you know there's jockeying behind the scenes and then people take [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5583.240000000001s)]
*  their turn i will say to the democrats credit that they're usually very disciplined about [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5588.4400000000005s)]
*  these issues and you know they'll have their vicious uh game of identity politics behind the [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5593.16s)]
*  scenes right but then one person will emerge from that and some deal making okay you run for this [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5599.400000000001s)]
*  you run for that you run for the other you wait your turn so it was kamala harris's turn to [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5604.28s)]
*  graduate from her two terms as attorney general to run for the senate and the pathway was cleared [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5608.679999999999s)]
*  for her to do that so then i mean if you when you win the democratic primary in california [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5617.4s)]
*  statewide you're you're done yeah the the opposition we always do as republicans and i'm [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omgw-g1gVnM&t=5622.12s)]
