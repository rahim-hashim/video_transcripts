# Tucker’s Neighbor on Rural America, Overcoming Addiction, and Donald Trump
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero)
*  This fall during hunting season, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=0.0s)]
*  I was getting a slice of pizza at a general store [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2.44s)]
*  in a small town in the mountains of Western Maine, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=5.36s)]
*  and I was standing in line and I ran into a guy I know, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=8.88s)]
*  a guy I like a lot called Esau Cooper, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=11.08s)]
*  who was a local excavator, and he said, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=13.56s)]
*  I've been watching ya. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=15.68s)]
*  Interviewing all these people? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=17.48s)]
*  Why don't you interview me? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=18.52s)]
*  I got interesting stuff to say. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And I thought, you know, I bet he does. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=22.72s)]
*  Esau Cooper is an interesting person. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=25.72s)]
*  Esau Cooper is not only a good upstanding citizen [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=27.96s)]
*  of his town, to remain unnamed, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=32.52s)]
*  in the Western Maine mountains, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=34.72s)]
*  but he's also the local lawnmower racing champ. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  Every year, this town in August has a lawnmower race, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=39.64s)]
*  and Esau Cooper often wins it, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=44.52s)]
*  sometimes at great personal risk. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=46.56s)]
*  Here's a video of it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  Esau is the one in the green John Deere [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  that runs into the camera. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=52.8s)]
*  Lei is now head pastry. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  He loves it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  And then these guys, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  are maintenance purchase per�리. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  And that's up to corrosion [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  right on on the Fang. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=102.32s)]
*  With lawnmower racing, it's one of those things [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=103.88s)]
*  you make fun of as a curiosity and oddity for rural areas, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  until you see it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  And then you realize these guys [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=109.6s)]
*  are legit automotive engineers, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=110.6s)]
*  of engineers and they have major stones, it's dangerous. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=112.6s)]
*  That video, by the way, shot by Toby Winslow. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=115.14s)]
*  Esau Cooper, the man on the green John Deere, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=117.61999999999999s)]
*  joins us now in studio. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=120.22s)]
*  Esau, it's great to see you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=121.38s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=122.86s)]
*  Wasn't joking. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=124.52s)]
*  So, first, a lot more racing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  How fast do those go? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=127.74s)]
*  The sky's the limit. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=130.26s)]
*  It depends on how fast you make it go. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=131.34s)]
*  Our particular track in Andover, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=133.82s)]
*  we 25, 30 miles an hour is probably too fast [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=135.5s)]
*  to make turn one. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  So, not particularly fast, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=141.0s)]
*  but because the track's small and tight, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=143.64s)]
*  it looks like you're flying. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  It certainly does, I've seen it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=147.56s)]
*  The straight stretch is only 100 feet long. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=148.84s)]
*  So, if you get your track to pull for 100 feet, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=151.56s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  you're good. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=155.48s)]
*  Well, so how do you get a ride-on mower [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=156.32s)]
*  to go 30 miles an hour? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  Change the pulleys and get rid of the governor. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=159.48s)]
*  How do you get rid of the governor? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=163.64s)]
*  You just unhook a few springs and pull it back, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=165.2s)]
*  so the motor turns, pushes as fast as it can all the time. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  It's not good for longevity of the motor, but. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=173.94s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=176.78s)]
*  Could you do that in any vehicle? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=178.62s)]
*  You can get rid of the governor. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  On a lawnmower engine, yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=181.26s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  So, you do that over the winter? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  No, winter I log, stormbale hunt. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  Oh. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=189.62s)]
*  It's springtime when there's no, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  you can't cut wood and it's too early to start digging. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=191.94s)]
*  That's when the lawnmowers come out [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=195.14s)]
*  and we start tinkering them off. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  And for people who don't live in an area where logging's big, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  why can't you log in the spring? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=200.6s)]
*  It's a mud season. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=201.92s)]
*  They post the roads, so you can't drive big trucks [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  on the roads and the snow melts [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=205.44s)]
*  and the ground gets really soft. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  The frost goes out and it's just, the ground is soft. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=209.2s)]
*  You can't do much other than go in the garage [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=214.2s)]
*  and fix equipment and tinker on lawnmowers. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=216.64s)]
*  How long have you been logging? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=220.6s)]
*  30 years. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=223.16s)]
*  A guy from your town got killed last year logging. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=224.46s)]
*  Good friend of mine. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  How'd that happen and how do people get killed logging? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=230.8s)]
*  Well, generally speaking, people get complacent. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=234.94s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  He was actually taught logging [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=238.82000000000002s)]
*  and he knew how to do it, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  was considered a considerable logger. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=243.66000000000003s)]
*  I looked at the site. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=248.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=250.58s)]
*  He went and cut another tree while a tree got hung up [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=252.02s)]
*  and he went and cut another tree [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=260.8s)]
*  in the line of sight of that tree that was hung up [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=264.56s)]
*  and the tree fell on him and killed him. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=267.68s)]
*  So he, I mean, by reputation was, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=271.24s)]
*  and you just said, knew exactly what he was doing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=273.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=275.76s)]
*  So did you ever worry about getting hurt logging? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=276.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=280.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  You just, I mean, especially after that, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=283.7s)]
*  you just, you don't take those chances. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=287.74s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=290.78s)]
*  But this is all, you know, everybody, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=291.62s)]
*  everybody takes chances now and then, you know. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=294.18s)]
*  So how did you end up living in a little town [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  in Western Maine? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=300.14s)]
*  Oh. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=302.7s)]
*  Well, my mom is from Livermore Falls area. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=304.26s)]
*  She grew up in Maine. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=308.38s)]
*  My dad, my dad was from all over the Northeast. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=309.74s)]
*  I was born in New London, Connecticut. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  We moved to a little trailer park in Peru [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=317.53999999999996s)]
*  when I was really young. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=320.94s)]
*  Peru, Maine. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=322.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=323.18s)]
*  And then we moved to another small town in Western Maine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=324.42s)]
*  What town? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=329.58s)]
*  Rumford Center. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=331.74s)]
*  Very small town. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=332.56s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=333.4s)]
*  And when I was 10 years, my father died when I was six [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=334.24s)]
*  and shortly thereafter, my mom got remarried [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  and we moved to Andover when I was 10 [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=342.26s)]
*  and I was disgusted, I actually ran away from home. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=345.38s)]
*  Where'd you go? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=349.66s)]
*  An old Girl Scout camp on the Whippoorwill Road, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=351.1s)]
*  me and a buddy of mine. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=353.7s)]
*  I ran away on my 10 speed and disappeared for a day or two [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=355.94s)]
*  until they finally found us, you know. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=359.38s)]
*  We were just, at that time we were into Rambo. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=361.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=364.90000000000003s)]
*  Door survivalists and stuff. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  So we were gonna, I don't know what we were thinking. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=367.38s)]
*  I just was making a statement, I guess, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=370.42s)]
*  that this town sucks, I'm from Rumford [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=372.1s)]
*  and I'm going back to Rumford. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=374.02s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=375.5s)]
*  You thought Andover was bad. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=377.16s)]
*  It was not. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=378.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't know anybody. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  Shortly thereafter though, I met two guys [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=381.98s)]
*  that I consider brothers. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  Now one of them's gone to heaven. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=388.1s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  The other one I consider a brother. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=391.74s)]
*  There was the three of us, me, Mike and Mike. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=394.02s)]
*  And we grew up together and one of the Mikes died [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=396.54s)]
*  when I was 19. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=400.0s)]
*  Oof. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=401.74s)]
*  Died in a car accident. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=402.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=404.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=405.62s)]
*  So yeah, that changes you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=406.5s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=408.98s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=409.82s)]
*  Did you stay in the town? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=410.64s)]
*  Yep, and I did until I was 25. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=411.5s)]
*  Where'd you go? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=417.7s)]
*  Traveled all over the country, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=418.96s)]
*  putting in natural gas pipelines. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=420.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=423.74s)]
*  Yep, running from myself. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=424.58s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=425.7s)]
*  Well, I was, you know, I played too hard, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=427.54s)]
*  you know, work hard and drink even harder [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=433.74s)]
*  on the weekends. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=436.94s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=437.78000000000003s)]
*  Each town, there were temporary jobs. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=440.54s)]
*  You'd go into a town, you'd lay a pipe and you'd leave [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=443.06s)]
*  and each time I'd go into a town [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=445.06s)]
*  and I'd say it's gonna be different this time, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=447.42s)]
*  you know, and it was never any different. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=449.72s)]
*  Just the partying? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=453.72s)]
*  Yeah, the partying and it progressed. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=454.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  I started just drinking and then got into drugs [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=458.12s)]
*  and just, you know, it was a time in my life when, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=459.68s)]
*  at one time I was gonna make a career of pipelining. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=463.66s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=466.82000000000005s)]
*  And then at 31 I sobered up and I tried to keep pipelining. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=467.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=472.52000000000004s)]
*  I realized that it's just, when I quit drinking, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=473.36s)]
*  I had to let things go. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=477.08000000000004s)]
*  How'd you sober up? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=478.92s)]
*  Well, they first tried to put me in rehab at 13 [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=482.0s)]
*  and I wouldn't go. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=486.44s)]
*  13 years old? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=488.16s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=489.0s)]
*  They wouldn't take me up to Bangalore because the doctor [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=490.72s)]
*  says, the doctor's talking to me, he said, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=493.92s)]
*  I don't got a problem with alcohol, I love alcohol. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  At that time it was, it was just, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=499.68s)]
*  it was just drinking at that time, I believe. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=504.32s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=506.74s)]
*  And then at 15, I went in and I spent three, four days [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=507.62s)]
*  in detox because I ate too many Valiums. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=513.14s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=517.14s)]
*  And ended up in rehab for a month. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=517.98s)]
*  It's a 28 day program on the 21st day I got kicked out. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=520.46s)]
*  For what? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=525.86s)]
*  Well, I had been reprimanded for something, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=528.3s)]
*  I don't remember what, but one of the ways they punished you [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=533.04s)]
*  was at that time you could smoke right in rehab. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=536.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=538.6s)]
*  And no cigarettes for you, so I was like, yeah, okay. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=539.72s)]
*  And so I got in the line to get my daily cigarette [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=543.76s)]
*  or whatever it was, a long time ago. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=547.88s)]
*  And got up the line, got the cigarette, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=550.92s)]
*  went back to the smoking area, had a lighter, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=556.2s)]
*  I was just about to light it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=558.76s)]
*  And the nurse realized that I wasn't supposed [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=561.2s)]
*  to have a cigarette, so she, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=563.5600000000001s)]
*  bolted over to me and took my cigarette, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=565.76s)]
*  said you can't have that, you're being punished. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=568.24s)]
*  Said, oh really, and she's walking away, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  I said take your effing lighter too, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=574.28s)]
*  and I threw it at her. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=576.12s)]
*  And had I hit her with that lighter, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  I would have had to go to MYC, Main Youth Center. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=583.88s)]
*  I missed, thank God. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=584.7199999999999s)]
*  And they booted me, that was the end of that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=586.7199999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=591.28s)]
*  Did you get a rehab again after that? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=592.12s)]
*  10 years later. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=594.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=595.86s)]
*  25. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=596.6999999999999s)]
*  And I checked myself in, I had a massive cocaine problem, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=598.0999999999999s)]
*  and all I really wanted to do was quit that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=602.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=605.18s)]
*  So when I got out of there, I stayed sober [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=606.0s)]
*  for a little while, of course started back, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=609.3399999999999s)]
*  and that's when I started pipeline. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=611.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=614.14s)]
*  I actually got hired, I got hired in the paper mill [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=614.98s)]
*  in Rumford while I was in rehab. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=619.9s)]
*  And I told them, I said, well I'm in rehab right now, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=624.42s)]
*  because I had passed all their testing, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=626.4599999999999s)]
*  and they wanted me, and they called me up, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=628.0999999999999s)]
*  said okay, let's come to work. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=629.54s)]
*  I said, well, small problem, I'm in rehab right now. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=630.74s)]
*  Oh, that's okay when you get out, come on. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=634.78s)]
*  So I did, I went to work for, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=636.5s)]
*  I lasted 10 days and quit. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=638.14s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=640.36s)]
*  I went backlogging, I couldn't stand it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=642.98s)]
*  It was inside, it was toxic. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=645.9399999999999s)]
*  All my coworkers were overweight and bald and unhappy. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=646.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=650.86s)]
*  Do you think it makes you bald, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=651.6999999999999s)]
*  working in a paper mill? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=652.9s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=653.86s)]
*  I probably, yeah, that was probably mean, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=655.06s)]
*  but it just didn't look happy. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=656.66s)]
*  No, I agree. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=659.66s)]
*  I was an outdoor enthusiast, you know? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=660.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=663.14s)]
*  So I left, you know, I left. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=666.1s)]
*  And went backlogging, and shortly thereafter, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=668.1s)]
*  I jumped on, they were laying a natural gas pipeline [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=672.5s)]
*  in Peru. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=674.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=675.9s)]
*  And I got hired on that, and that was a godsend. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=676.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=680.9399999999999s)]
*  The wages were high, the outdoor, it was grueling, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=682.48s)]
*  it was hard work, and the mud, and equipment, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=688.04s)]
*  and laying pipe across, like, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=691.4s)]
*  how are we gonna lay a pipe across that, you know? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=694.64s)]
*  It was a- [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=696.84s)]
*  Like a grand ledge or something? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  Swamp, yeah, river crossings, just unreal stuff. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=698.52s)]
*  Tying crews, you know, were all the prestigious [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=701.72s)]
*  on a pipeline, tying crew. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=703.96s)]
*  And- [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=706.28s)]
*  The other ones who connect the pipes? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=707.12s)]
*  Connect the pipes in the hard spots. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=708.16s)]
*  The main line lays it in the easy spots, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=709.84s)]
*  and the tying crews come in and connect the pipe [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  in all the difficult areas, the swamps. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=715.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=718.4s)]
*  So, yeah, I got on that and started working that, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=719.64s)]
*  and it was my thing, I loved it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  I was gonna make a career out of it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=725.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=726.84s)]
*  And I did it for seven years until I realized [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  it was killing me, you know? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=731.48s)]
*  Not so much the work, but the nightlife. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=733.02s)]
*  Because with pipelining in a different town [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=736.64s)]
*  every six months came bar life. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=738.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=741.88s)]
*  Living in a motel and lots of drugs and- [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=742.72s)]
*  Do all the guys go out together at night? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=745.76s)]
*  Not all of them, not all of them, no. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=747.52s)]
*  There was sober, good, hard-working, normal people. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=753.28s)]
*  But, you know, I wasn't one of them. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=754.24s)]
*  I was a party animal, and they liked that, you know? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=756.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=761.24s)]
*  They liked you to work hard and play even harder. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=762.08s)]
*  Man. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=765.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, when you're working hard, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=766.6400000000001s)]
*  you can party hard for a while. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=767.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=769.48s)]
*  How did you end up stopping? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=770.32s)]
*  It sounds like you've been trying to stop for like, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=772.8800000000001s)]
*  a long time. Yeah, I knew, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=774.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't know, I left South Chicago on a job, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  and I headed east to another job. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=782.2800000000001s)]
*  I quit one job, was headed to another. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=786.4000000000001s)]
*  I wanted to make a change. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=789.4000000000001s)]
*  And when I got to the East Coast, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=791.82s)]
*  it was either head south to that job or head home [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=795.54s)]
*  and try to straighten my ass out. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=798.26s)]
*  And I was in trouble. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=800.62s)]
*  I knew, I was afraid, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=801.62s)]
*  I was afraid my mom was gonna go to my funeral. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=803.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=806.74s)]
*  It was really in my mind, you know? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=807.58s)]
*  And at that time, I didn't know I had a heart condition. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=809.54s)]
*  But you could just feel there was something wrong? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=812.46s)]
*  Yeah, I was living hard, you know? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  Doing a lot of drugs, snorting a lot of cocaine. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=818.3000000000001s)]
*  Putting chunks of, you know, gram chunks of cocaine [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=821.46s)]
*  in my coffee in the morning. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=823.86s)]
*  Does that work? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=825.4200000000001s)]
*  I go to work. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=826.26s)]
*  We party all night, smoke crack all night long, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=827.5400000000001s)]
*  sleep for 10 minutes. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=829.5s)]
*  Go to work six days a week, sometimes seven. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=832.02s)]
*  Wow. It was intense. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=834.9s)]
*  It sounds intense. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=836.46s)]
*  I made a ton of money. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=837.4200000000001s)]
*  I had, at the end of it, I had my apartment, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=839.3000000000001s)]
*  my room would be paid, my truck would be paid. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=841.94s)]
*  I'd had top hours of work informing. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=844.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=847.1800000000001s)]
*  And they'd just throw money at you and you try real hard. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=849.06s)]
*  I just, I didn't wanna die. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=852.5s)]
*  I didn't want my mom going to my funeral [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=853.9399999999999s)]
*  because I knew it would kill her. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=857.22s)]
*  So you've been to rehab three times at this point. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=858.58s)]
*  Did you quit in rehab a fourth time? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=860.8199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=863.9399999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=864.9s)]
*  No, by this time I had been taught enough. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=866.06s)]
*  I knew where the help was. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=869.26s)]
*  It was a 12-step program that I had been to before. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=870.26s)]
*  Yep. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=874.06s)]
*  One Monday morning, I woke up and things were different. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=874.9s)]
*  To this day, I don't know what happened, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=879.0600000000001s)]
*  but things just were different. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=882.0600000000001s)]
*  I knew I was in trouble. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=884.4200000000001s)]
*  And instead of going to the store and buying beer, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=889.46s)]
*  because that's what I wanted to do that morning, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=892.02s)]
*  woke up on my stepfather's couch. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=894.0600000000001s)]
*  I was living at the time on my stepdad's couch. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=895.58s)]
*  I had a pickup and that's it. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=899.26s)]
*  I didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=900.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=904.02s)]
*  So I just went to a meeting. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=905.74s)]
*  I went to a meeting that Monday night [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=909.34s)]
*  and I've been sober ever since. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=911.1800000000001s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=913.78s)]
*  How long has it been? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=914.62s)]
*  It'll be 20 years in March. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=915.46s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=918.94s)]
*  How have you been able to stay sober all that time? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=920.5s)]
*  God. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=923.5s)]
*  Yeah, I made a decision. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=925.1s)]
*  Shortly after that, I met a gentleman. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=929.74s)]
*  He's deceased now. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=935.66s)]
*  His name was Kip Cummings. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=937.46s)]
*  And he became my sponsor and he saved my life. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=940.42s)]
*  I could relate to him. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=944.7s)]
*  He was a grumpy old man and he was black and white. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=946.14s)]
*  If you do this, you get that result. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=949.62s)]
*  And I responded to that. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=951.3000000000001s)]
*  He'd say, there are clear cut directions in this book [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=952.5s)]
*  and you'll get this result. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=956.9s)]
*  And I've always been able to read directions [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=958.0600000000001s)]
*  and do something. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=961.82s)]
*  That's how my mind works. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=963.34s)]
*  And it made sense to me. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=965.7s)]
*  And he reminded me of like my grandfather or my father. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=967.98s)]
*  I like old, mean old men who are, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=972.9000000000001s)]
*  you could tell they've worked hard [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=977.62s)]
*  and they've been through the wringer [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=979.62s)]
*  and I could relate to them. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=980.7s)]
*  I've always been around people like that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=982.86s)]
*  So he helped me. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=985.46s)]
*  He just taught me how to become a man, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=987.94s)]
*  how to stay sober. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=989.9000000000001s)]
*  And he died a few years back, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=991.5799999999999s)]
*  but he just taught me how to be a grownup. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=997.14s)]
*  Was he right? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=999.66s)]
*  I mean, did your life change for the better [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1000.5799999999999s)]
*  once you got sober? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1002.1s)]
*  Well, it slowly has. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1003.46s)]
*  I'm in the process of changing my life. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1005.26s)]
*  It's been a long journey. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1008.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1010.18s)]
*  I quit drinking, doing drugs. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1014.3s)]
*  I was straight up for a year and a half. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1016.34s)]
*  And not everybody knows this. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1019.34s)]
*  This is, but I couldn't take the pressure of life. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1021.1s)]
*  I started smoking pot. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1027.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1028.58s)]
*  So it took me a long time. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1030.54s)]
*  I didn't wanna be, I felt like a hypocrite [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1032.54s)]
*  trying to help people get sober, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1035.38s)]
*  talk at a meeting, and then get high on the ride home. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1038.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1042.46s)]
*  So I had a lot of hypocritical feelings towards myself, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1043.38s)]
*  but March 13th, 2021, I was able to kick that. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1047.74s)]
*  What do you, so? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1055.02s)]
*  Shortly after they legalized it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1056.7s)]
*  I was about to say, it's illegal in your state. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1058.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1059.9s)]
*  What do you- [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1060.74s)]
*  The worst idea ever. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1061.58s)]
*  I voted no. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1062.6200000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1063.78s)]
*  It's just not sending a good message. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1065.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1068.42s)]
*  It's just not. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1069.26s)]
*  Do we wanna promote drugs? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1071.1s)]
*  Do we really want to? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1073.18s)]
*  Or do we wanna just, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1074.6999999999998s)]
*  I don't know what the answer is. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1077.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't wanna chase around a bunch of potheads [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1081.6599999999999s)]
*  and spend a bunch of money on it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1084.26s)]
*  I also don't wanna just have it be okay and be, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1086.86s)]
*  I mean, maybe, you know the tobacco campaigns that they have? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1090.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1095.5s)]
*  Why don't we have weed campaigns? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1096.34s)]
*  Telling you- [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1098.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, you tell me. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1099.02s)]
*  I mean, you've used a lot of drugs. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1099.9799999999998s)]
*  You've smoked a lot of weed in your life. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1101.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1102.54s)]
*  Why do you clearly- [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1103.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm a little dumber. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1104.74s)]
*  It put me in a little bubble [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1106.58s)]
*  so I couldn't relate with people. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1107.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1109.54s)]
*  It, instead of relying on my higher power, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1112.6200000000001s)]
*  God, Jesus Christ, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1116.1000000000001s)]
*  I relied on marijuana. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1118.9s)]
*  And before that, it was alcohol. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1120.6200000000001s)]
*  Before that, it was cocaine, all this stuff. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1122.18s)]
*  My higher power now is God. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1125.38s)]
*  God, just a God. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1129.26s)]
*  You know? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1131.02s)]
*  That has evolved. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1132.2199999999998s)]
*  It started out as, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1133.1399999999999s)]
*  I wasn't a godly person when I quit drinking. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1136.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1139.6999999999998s)]
*  But I learned through a 12-step program, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1140.54s)]
*  and eventually, through the Bible, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1143.74s)]
*  that that is the answer to all our problems, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1147.5s)]
*  I believe, in my- [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1150.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1151.6999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1152.9399999999998s)]
*  I agree. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1153.8999999999999s)]
*  So, as someone who's smoked a lot of marijuana, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1155.9399999999998s)]
*  you think it is bad for people. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1159.1799999999998s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1161.3s)]
*  That's an unpopular thing to say. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1163.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1165.3799999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1166.22s)]
*  Because people don't wanna hear it. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1167.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1169.86s)]
*  They don't wanna hear it. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1170.7s)]
*  They don't wanna hear it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1171.54s)]
*  I have a lot of successful friends that smoke daily. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1173.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1177.54s)]
*  So, you can't, if you don't ever see the insanity, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1178.3799999999999s)]
*  it's like cigarettes. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1181.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1182.3s)]
*  Where's the insanity? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1183.1399999999999s)]
*  It's easy to see how bad alcohol is for you, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1183.98s)]
*  or cocaine, or crack, or heroin, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1186.62s)]
*  but marijuana is so insidious, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1189.5s)]
*  it's so mild, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1193.34s)]
*  it's hard to see how it's holding you back. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1196.18s)]
*  I mean, myself, personally, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1200.98s)]
*  I became a better businessman, a better parent. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1204.78s)]
*  I can remember numbers now. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1209.62s)]
*  It's just better. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1212.46s)]
*  I'm not in that bubble. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1213.62s)]
*  I can relate to people. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1215.14s)]
*  I can see people in Mills Market [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1217.1399999999999s)]
*  and start up a conversation with them [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1219.4199999999998s)]
*  instead of running out the door, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1221.3799999999999s)]
*  because I smell like a skunk. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1223.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1224.54s)]
*  You know? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1225.3799999999999s)]
*  Where did you get your politics from? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1229.1399999999999s)]
*  I'd say my Uncle Esau. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1232.62s)]
*  Your Uncle Esau? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1234.8999999999999s)]
*  My Uncle Esau. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1235.86s)]
*  I think that's a song, isn't it? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1236.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1238.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1239.26s)]
*  It's funny, I have never met another Esau [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1242.06s)]
*  except for people in my family. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1244.34s)]
*  And then just the other day, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1246.94s)]
*  I was listening to a podcast on the radio, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1247.78s)]
*  and there was this dude named Esau, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1249.46s)]
*  a black guy named Esau who was a pastor, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1252.46s)]
*  and he's in Massachusetts. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1254.54s)]
*  I was listening to Bible Thumping Radio, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1256.5s)]
*  and this dude was on there, his name was Esau, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1258.82s)]
*  and I was like, wow, that was amazing. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1260.74s)]
*  The first time ever. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1263.26s)]
*  What was your Uncle Esau like? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1264.22s)]
*  He was a staunch Republican, free market guy. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1266.18s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1270.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1271.02s)]
*  Where was he from? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1272.4199999999998s)]
*  Auburn. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1273.46s)]
*  Maine. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1274.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1275.3s)]
*  He's still in Auburn. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1276.98s)]
*  He's a paver. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1278.18s)]
*  Yep. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1279.22s)]
*  Yep, my whole father's side of the family were all pavers. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1280.18s)]
*  Really? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1283.8200000000002s)]
*  Asphalt pavers, yep. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1284.66s)]
*  Cooper Paving, there's a whole bunch of them. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1285.5s)]
*  Yep. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1288.22s)]
*  Bread to pave. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1289.3400000000001s)]
*  Pave driveways, pave roads, pave parking lots, yep. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1290.74s)]
*  Pave, pave, pave, pave. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1293.5s)]
*  I worked for him for two years out of us. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1295.46s)]
*  When I first got sober, I went to work for my cousin, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1298.5400000000002s)]
*  Cooper Pave in LLC. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1302.3400000000001s)]
*  And I lasted a couple years and had to move on. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1304.66s)]
*  Well, what happened, I bought an excavator [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1308.78s)]
*  to fix up a piece of land of mine. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1310.38s)]
*  And it kind of evolved and I started getting side jobs [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1313.78s)]
*  and I finally said, you know what, screw it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1316.38s)]
*  I'm going on my own. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1318.38s)]
*  That's how I became, that's how I get into the business. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1319.26s)]
*  Do you like it? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1322.66s)]
*  The business I'm in? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1324.02s)]
*  Yep. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1324.98s)]
*  I love what I do. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1326.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't necessarily like the business aspect of it. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1328.74s)]
*  But you like excavating? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1331.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1332.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1333.86s)]
*  I like taking raw land and creating something out of it. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1335.26s)]
*  I can stand on the side of a road [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1339.58s)]
*  and look at the contour of the land [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1342.6599999999999s)]
*  and some folks want it cleared and they want to put a house [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1345.1s)]
*  and I can see, you know, you can see, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1348.1799999999998s)]
*  you know, how it should be. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1352.82s)]
*  And you get a vision and you do it and it's awesome. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1354.98s)]
*  It's very rewarding. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1357.4599999999998s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1358.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of artistic. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1359.58s)]
*  Do you, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1363.58s)]
*  do you notice the difference between the town you grew up in, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1366.3s)]
*  which you still live in, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1369.1s)]
*  the way it was when you were a kid and it is now? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1370.22s)]
*  Where the country? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1374.26s)]
*  Other than there's a lot of people I don't know now. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1375.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1376.6999999999998s)]
*  As far as the politics goes, it's basically the same. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1377.74s)]
*  What about the country you grew up in? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1380.4599999999998s)]
*  How is it different? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1381.82s)]
*  I'm distraught about my country. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1388.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1391.34s)]
*  Because our freedoms are [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1392.86s)]

*  What the federal government is doing to Mr. Trump [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1401.06s)]
*  with the like political persecution [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1404.8999999999999s)]
*  and the, what is it called, lawfare. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1407.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1409.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's just gross. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1410.62s)]
*  It's gross. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1412.1799999999998s)]
*  It's gross. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1413.9399999999998s)]
*  And I believe that [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1415.5s)]
*  this is what happened. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1419.02s)]
*  This country has turned from God [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1419.9399999999998s)]
*  and now we're cursed. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1422.26s)]
*  This is what we got. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1426.5s)]
*  That's my theory. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1427.98s)]
*  Do most people you know like Trump? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1430.74s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1434.82s)]
*  Why is Trump so popular in rural America? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1436.02s)]
*  Because of blue collar workers. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1438.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1440.34s)]
*  There's very few educated elites. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1442.22s)]
*  And actually there's a couple in our town [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1446.7s)]
*  and they don't like Trump. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1448.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1450.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1451.6200000000001s)]
*  So it's a class thing as far as you can tell. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1452.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1454.98s)]

*  Except sometimes I just kind of throw in a little jab [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1473.0600000000002s)]
*  like just to get her goat. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1476.02s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1479.3400000000001s)]

*  she may try to express, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1487.5s)]
*  how do I put it? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1493.38s)]
*  A desire to be compassionate of the gender baloney [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1496.46s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1502.8200000000002s)]
*  And I'll totally state where I am. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1503.66s)]
*  I guess I recently, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1507.54s)]
*  she accused me of being a sexist [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1508.66s)]
*  and I was like, yeah, I am, I guess. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1511.7s)]
*  A sexist, sorry. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1514.02s)]
*  What did she say? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1517.5s)]
*  Laughed, she knows me. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1518.8600000000001s)]
*  It's all good. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1520.98s)]
*  You sure she wasn't trying to say sexy? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1522.74s)]
*  No, I don't think so because she's like 70 something. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1525.42s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1533.66s)]
*  But she's, yeah, I just think she's crazy [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1535.54s)]
*  and a shit house rat. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1538.7s)]

*  There's a lot of crazy people in Andover. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1542.86s)]
*  I weren't supposed to use that name. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1546.42s)]
*  What percentage of your town do you think [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1547.5s)]
*  will vote for Trump? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1549.18s)]

*  I mean, there's a bunch of people [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1554.42s)]
*  that just refuse to see the truth. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1558.22s)]
*  I have a, someone in my family is, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1561.18s)]
*  oh, hates Trump, gonna vote Democratic [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1565.74s)]
*  and he just, I'm not gonna say his name, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1569.66s)]
*  but it's just, it's like, if you go principal, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1572.3400000000001s)]
*  if you stand there and you talk on principle, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1575.98s)]
*  okay, we believe in this, we believe in this, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1578.46s)]
*  we believe in this, we're just the same. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1580.9s)]
*  But when it comes voting day, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1583.74s)]
*  check the Democratic box. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1587.7s)]
*  How do you, so a lot, you live in Maine, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1589.66s)]
*  which is run by socialists. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1593.3000000000002s)]
*  Oh, you don't like the leadership of the state? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1599.94s)]
*  I don't like our current secretary of state. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1602.5400000000002s)]
*  He's gone on the bad side of me [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1605.94s)]
*  with the whole taking, trying to take Mr. Trump [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1607.94s)]
*  off the primary ballot. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1611.74s)]
*  But it does, it seems like that's very far away [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1615.22s)]
*  from where you live. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1617.94s)]
*  Like it's a totally different world. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1619.06s)]
*  Well, not if you, I watch the news. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1621.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this, if you watch the news, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1625.1s)]
*  I'm kind of a news junkie. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1629.02s)]
*  So where do you get your news? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1631.18s)]
*  Like what? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1633.38s)]
*  Yeah, like you, I mean, you live, you know, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1634.3s)]
*  hours from the nearest airport, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1637.26s)]
*  so it's pretty far away, right? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1639.18s)]
*  Where do you, how do you find out [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1642.22s)]
*  what's going on in the world? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1643.74s)]
*  What do you read, what do you watch? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1644.58s)]
*  TV? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1646.26s)]
*  Yep. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1647.14s)]
*  I used to be, I used to watch a lot of Fox News. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1648.1399999999999s)]
*  Matter of fact, I watched it as often [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1652.74s)]
*  as my family would let me. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1655.34s)]
*  Yep. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1657.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, I'd turn Fox on and my wife [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1658.34s)]
*  and my kids would be like, oh, here we go again. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1660.74s)]
*  You know, because they just had it, they don't want it. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1663.82s)]
*  But I listened to the news two, three nights a week, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1666.1s)]
*  maybe four. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1670.1s)]
*  So the day they fired your ass was the last day [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1672.34s)]
*  I have not watched 10 seconds of Fox since they fired you. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1677.58s)]
*  Have you caught your wife or kids watching? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1682.94s)]
*  Nope, just on principle. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1684.46s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1685.98s)]
*  Just on principle, just because I just think it was wrong [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1686.82s)]
*  because it was obvious that they were putting pressure. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1691.98s)]
*  You were telling the truth, in my opinion, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1695.42s)]
*  you were telling the truth about a bunch of stuff [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1697.26s)]
*  and you got too close to the truth and they got rid of you. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1699.62s)]
*  So that's just my thing on that. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1702.26s)]
*  So where do you go? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1704.74s)]
*  Now I'm watching Newsmax, now I'm a Newsmax guy. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1705.74s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1708.1799999999998s)]
*  No, it's all right. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1709.98s)]
*  It's grown on me. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1712.1399999999999s)]
*  You go on the internet? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1713.1s)]
*  No, not for news, no. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1714.62s)]
*  What's your shirt mean? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1716.82s)]
*  Ho ho. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1718.22s)]
*  This is a direct retort to Joe Biden's speech [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1720.4199999999998s)]
*  that he gave last week where he basically called [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1726.74s)]
*  all Trump supporters domestic terrorists. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1728.9399999999998s)]
*  Yep. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1731.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1731.9399999999998s)]
*  Let's brand domestic terrorism as cool. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1733.5s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1740.82s)]
*  Because I'm a Bible thumping, hardworking, blue collar. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1743.22s)]
*  I got a few guns, I'm no gun expert, but I got a few. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1749.02s)]
*  I hunt fish, I will die for my country. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1753.9s)]
*  Oh, that's a good story. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1756.38s)]
*  I tried to go into the service. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1758.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=1760.18s)]

*  I can't believe I'm not one of those people, actually. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2128.2599999999998s)]
*  So now you race at a big track in Oxford, Maine. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2131.5s)]
*  Well, I used to. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2135.58s)]
*  I did it for two years. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2137.58s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2138.94s)]
*  They got rid of the trucks this year, the Candom. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2139.7799999999997s)]
*  No more trucks racing at Oxford this year. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2142.4199999999996s)]
*  Why? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2145.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2147.18s)]
*  But so, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2148.14s)]
*  my wife never really liked it, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2151.94s)]
*  so I'm just kind of gonna back away from it, you know. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2153.4199999999996s)]
*  You had a pretty bad crash though, didn't you? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2156.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but it didn't hurt. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2158.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2160.1s)]
*  It was really cool. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2160.94s)]
*  I got out of the truck and did a bow and the crowd loved it. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2161.78s)]
*  What happened to your truck? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2165.42s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2166.94s)]
*  I mean, it dented it, but broke some bent spindles [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2167.86s)]
*  and broke a few rims and smashed a windshield. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2173.6200000000003s)]
*  But my stepdad in his garage with one leg [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2178.1s)]
*  fixed it in a week. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2182.86s)]
*  We raced the following week. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2183.94s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2185.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2186.1800000000003s)]
*  That's how I worked. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2187.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2188.5s)]
*  That's a- [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2189.34s)]
*  I'd go there in the evening, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2190.18s)]
*  he'd be pounding and smashing on, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2191.02s)]
*  he'd be all bloody knuckled. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2191.98s)]
*  Got it ready. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2194.9s)]
*  And we went and we raced again. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2195.9s)]
*  And the following week, I did it again in practice [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2197.7s)]
*  and that was embarrassing. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2201.5s)]
*  That wasn't cool like the first time. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2202.74s)]
*  The second time was embarrassing. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2204.14s)]
*  What did you do the second time? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2205.3s)]
*  We were in practice and a guy came underneath me [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2207.1s)]
*  and poked me and I spun sideways and rolled like four times, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2208.94s)]
*  did an endo and crashed. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2213.94s)]
*  You did an end over end? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2216.06s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2217.2599999999998s)]
*  I didn't see it, but they told me, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2218.1s)]
*  they told me if last week's crash was an 8.5, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2220.98s)]
*  this week's was a 10. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2224.58s)]
*  That's what one guy told me. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2225.94s)]
*  So I was like, oh, all right, yeah. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2226.9s)]
*  But it wasn't, it was embarrassing. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2228.42s)]
*  This time it was embarrassing. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2230.22s)]
*  So when you're in a vehicle on a track at high speed [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2231.46s)]
*  and it's going end over end or side over side, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2234.42s)]
*  what are you thinking? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2236.66s)]
*  Please stop before I run into something. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2239.5s)]
*  That's what I was thinking the first time [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2242.7s)]
*  when I was barrel rolling. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2243.94s)]
*  When I was barrel rolling down Victory Lane, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2244.82s)]
*  I was like, it was like, took forever. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2248.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2251.34s)]
*  And then when I came to stop, I was on my roof [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2253.1000000000004s)]
*  and I'm like, oh, okay. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2256.9s)]
*  So the lady come over, she said, you all right? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2258.78s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2261.42s)]
*  But I put my hand down, I could smell gas. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2262.98s)]
*  I put my hand down and it was all wet with gas. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2264.7000000000003s)]
*  So then I'm like trying to freak out. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2267.1800000000003s)]
*  Were you smoking? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2269.02s)]
*  No, no, but I was afraid, one little spark. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2269.86s)]
*  The truck's hot, you've been racing. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2273.66s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2275.22s)]
*  There's a chance of fire. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2276.06s)]
*  So I kind of got a little nerved up [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2277.1s)]
*  and I couldn't get my belt undone [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2279.7799999999997s)]
*  because I was kind of tripping out a little bit. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2281.06s)]
*  And finally when I got done, I went smashed down on the roof [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2282.54s)]
*  and I got out and I was all covered with gas [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2285.46s)]
*  but there was no fire and it was all good. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2287.18s)]
*  And I got out and I was a little discombobulated [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2288.7799999999997s)]
*  and I turned towards the crowd and I did a bow [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2291.22s)]
*  and they just went nuts and they loved it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2294.58s)]
*  And it was awesome. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2296.5s)]
*  Was your wife there? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2297.94s)]
*  Nope, I think she wasn't. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2298.94s)]
*  So let me just ask you finally about Trump, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2300.8599999999997s)]
*  a little more specifically. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2303.8999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2305.58s)]
*  So I asked you what you're mad about in America [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2306.4199999999996s)]
*  and the second thing you said was [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2309.1s)]
*  they're persecuting Trump on political grounds. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2311.14s)]
*  What do you like about Trump? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2315.1s)]
*  He tells it how it is. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2317.7799999999997s)]
*  He's pro-business and he's anti-swamp. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2320.06s)]
*  What do you mean anti-swamp? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2325.22s)]
*  What do you mean anti-swamp? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2327.06s)]
*  In our government, there's a bunch of people [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2332.66s)]
*  that all they do is keep making the government [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2336.98s)]
*  bigger and bigger and bigger to give themselves jobs. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2340.54s)]
*  They have a budget and they make sure [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2343.54s)]
*  they spend every penny of it so that they can get more [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2345.2599999999998s)]
*  instead of trying to save some money [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2350.46s)]
*  because they're all worried that they won't get as much [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2352.22s)]
*  in the next year's budget. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2355.42s)]
*  So they spend every dime, every year, all the time [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2357.26s)]
*  and that's what happens to bureaucracy. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2359.94s)]
*  Job one of a bureaucracy is to make itself bigger [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2362.3s)]
*  and Trump recognized that and he tried cleaning it out, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2365.7400000000002s)]
*  tried making it work right, work like a decent business [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2371.38s)]
*  and that's why they hate him so much. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2374.78s)]
*  That's why the left hates Trump is because he was trying [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2380.3s)]
*  to make our government honest and work for the people, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2384.18s)]
*  beneficial to you and I. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2392.1s)]
*  He wanted to do that and he exposed the lies, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2395.2599999999998s)]
*  you know what I mean, he exposed the corruption [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2401.4199999999996s)]
*  and that's why they're doing what they're doing to him. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2405.3399999999997s)]
*  Could you imagine how successful his presidency had been [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2409.7799999999997s)]
*  if he hadn't had all the pushback by the left, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2413.26s)]
*  by the powers that be, by the press? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2421.86s)]
*  Imagine what we could have gotten done in the past [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2426.0200000000004s)]
*  because it would have been eight years. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2428.26s)]
*  He would have got elected the second time [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2429.7000000000003s)]
*  if it weren't for the press. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2431.2200000000003s)]
*  And that's another thing I lay blame to them. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2433.6600000000003s)]
*  There's no free press anymore. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2437.0600000000004s)]
*  They're not, they used to be, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2439.82s)]
*  they used to hold the politicians accountable. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2443.02s)]
*  Now, only if you're a Republican, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2445.26s)]
*  do you get held accountable. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2447.98s)]
*  You're a Democrat and you just ignore you, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2449.6200000000003s)]
*  you know, only talk about, it's so, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2452.7400000000002s)]
*  oh, drives me up a wall. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2458.1000000000004s)]
*  If Trump was here, what would you say to him? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2460.2200000000003s)]
*  I'd shake his hand, I'd ask him [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2463.98s)]
*  if he was looking for any help. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2467.2200000000003s)]
*  And then I'd tell him he's got my vote in the fall. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2470.34s)]
*  I wouldn't bother making any suggestions [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2476.46s)]
*  on what I think he should do to win [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2478.38s)]
*  because I know he wouldn't listen. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2480.5s)]
*  That's about it. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2485.6200000000003s)]
*  Issa Cooper, it was great to see you at lunch. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2488.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm glad you came. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2492.1400000000003s)]
*  Thank you, thanks for having me, I'm humbled. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K3ZsgKrero&t=2493.42s)]
