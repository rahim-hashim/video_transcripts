# Mother of Likely Murdered OpenAI Whistleblower Reveals All, Calls for Investigation of Sam Altman
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y)
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  My son, I owe this to him. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3.0s)]
*  Well this is a remarkable story. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=7.08s)]
*  So we were connected by someone we both know. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=9.32s)]
*  I had followed this casually in the media. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=12.08s)]
*  I didn't know what to make of it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=14.56s)]
*  Your son died in November. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=16.56s)]
*  You commissioned an examination by a forensic pathologist, independent forensic pathologist [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=18.92s)]
*  called Dr. Dinesh Rao. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=24.8s)]
*  I have it right here accompanied by photographs that you took. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=27.2s)]
*  And I don't think any honest person looking at this would conclude this was a suicide. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=30.48s)]
*  There's an awful lot of evidence that it wasn't. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=36.24s)]
*  I was actually shocked by it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=39.2s)]
*  So I want to get into the details of what may have happened. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=41.96s)]
*  But I'd like to start, if you don't mind, by hearing about your son. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Who was he? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=49.2s)]
*  How old was he? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=50.2s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=51.2s)]
*  What was he like? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=52.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=53.2s)]
*  Suchir was a prodigy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=54.2s)]
*  From birth we knew he was gifted. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=55.24s)]
*  And for living he studied his master's bachelor's in computer science from UC Berkeley, the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=57.6s)]
*  top school. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  He had 4.0 GPA throughout. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=64.8s)]
*  As soon as he graduated he started working in OpenAI as a researcher, AI researcher. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=67.44s)]
*  His first project was WebGPT for which a fresh graduate he took the lead role. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  And that WebGPT turned out into be CHAPGPT, an application. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=83.92s)]
*  This was a publication of four people. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=85.64s)]
*  One of them is Suchir. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=89.08s)]
*  Following this he worked at OpenAI for pre-training data. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=91.92s)]
*  That means he was scooping up all the internet data, feeding to CHAPGPT's AI model. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=95.44s)]
*  Following this he worked on... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=102.72s)]
*  Which is the fuel that it runs on. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  It needs massive amounts of data in order to become what it is, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=105.72s)]
*  That's the requirement. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  It's an AI model. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  And for the AI model there needs to be data fed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=113.0s)]
*  And this data is what everybody is saying is copyright data. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  That's what all the lawsuits are against. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=119.8s)]
*  He was involved in fueling that data. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=122.16s)]
*  He was directly involved in that part of the business. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=124.96s)]
*  He knows inside out. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=128.88s)]
*  Following that he worked directly on the CHAPGPT application team itself under John Shkleman. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=131.64s)]
*  In this team he was vital. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=137.42s)]
*  His former boss John claims that his role was vital in the CHAPGPT team. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=139.18s)]
*  And he did some kind of tuning and optimization. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  Made it very efficient. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=147.6s)]
*  It's a significant contribution. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=148.6s)]
*  But the irony is he was never acknowledged by OpenAI. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=150.86s)]
*  And even after he left OpenAI, after his death also no one has acknowledged him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=154.78s)]
*  Prior to joining OpenAI he was so qualified. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=160.86s)]
*  He was national champion 2016 for computing Olympia. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=164.28s)]
*  That means he was the top programmer of 2016. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=169.02s)]
*  Following that he went he took a gap year at 17. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=172.96s)]
*  He said he doesn't need a degree. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=175.94s)]
*  Right after 12th he said I don't need a degree. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=177.44s)]
*  I don't need to go to college. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=179.88s)]
*  He took up a job in Cora as software engineer. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  He was hired with $25,000 sign on bonus and a pay equivalent to a masters or a bachelor's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  holder. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=190.96s)]
*  He worked there for a year and then he joined UC Berkeley after taking a gap year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=192.36s)]
*  He took a lot of effort on parents and to persuade him to go back to college for which [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=197.96s)]
*  he was grateful throughout. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  In UC Berkeley he represented UC Berkeley for ACM ICPC inter-college programming contest. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=205.6s)]
*  The world contest. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=212.44s)]
*  He went to China along with his team. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=214.0s)]
*  It was in 2017. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=216.8s)]
*  2018 he won $100,000 award for a TSA competition. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=219.16s)]
*  This is for passenger screening algorithm which TSA has implemented today. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=225.1s)]
*  He was shining all throughout his life. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=230.04s)]
*  Prior to this at the age of 11 he got 680 in SAT and then at 14 the paper he wrote like [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=233.28s)]
*  makes me believe he is a prodigy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=241.48s)]
*  That science paper is about quantum computing, optimizing a CPU and like he talks about VLSI [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  design that my friends claim they studied in their masters in electronics and communications. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=252.96s)]
*  All these things make me believe he is a prodigy and he has demonstrated he had exceptional [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=259.7s)]
*  abilities. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=265.46000000000004s)]
*  It sounds like he did. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  It sounds like from reading about it that he ran into trouble only when he began to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=270.5s)]
*  question whether or not the data that was being fed to OpenAI was copyrighted. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=275.42s)]
*  He never raised a voice when he was within OpenAI because he had concerns that management [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=283.42s)]
*  will not approve and he started to question all these when Chagy Pitty became profit making. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=289.18s)]
*  As long as it was non-profit it was okay. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  He explains in his publication on suchee.net what his views are and why he believes this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=300.16s)]
*  is copyright violation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=306.56s)]
*  And when he started after the reinstatement of Sam Altman in 2023 November, November 21st [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  was the day he got reinstated. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  I know it so well because it was suchee's birthday that day. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=317.56s)]
*  He got reinstated and after that suchee started thinking about the copyright violation and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=321.72s)]
*  he did discuss with me it's very unethical and he feels awful about it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  And I said yes it's unethical I agree with you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  What's unethical is using copyrighted material, material owned by other people for your business [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  which yeah artist's work will be lost. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  Their means of living will be impacted. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=345.66s)]
*  And also he did a research and he published like how the stack overflow and then few other [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=348.56s)]
*  websites like maybe Khora, few other websites that traffic is reducing and he also made [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=356.2s)]
*  a publication in which he explains that the answer given by Chagy Pitty versus the answer [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=360.88s)]
*  given by stack overflow, how unscientific and inaccurate the answer is. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=372.8s)]
*  When did he leave OpenAI? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=374.24s)]
*  He left in August. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  Of 2024. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=378.36s)]
*  Yes, third week of August. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=379.36s)]
*  So recently. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=382.38s)]
*  Very recently. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=383.38s)]
*  When did he write his now famous paper about what the management of OpenAI was doing with [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=385.12s)]
*  copyrighted material? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=390.92s)]
*  Next day he already had made up his mind prior to leaving OpenAI. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=394.32s)]
*  In fact in July he discussed with his UC Berkeley colleague that he wanted to do a startup and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=399.04s)]
*  his friend expressed interest, his name is Tyler Rizu. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=404.64s)]
*  And next day after leaving OpenAI he went on interview with Canadian news media. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=409.44s)]
*  We didn't know anything about it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=415.64s)]
*  Yeah, we just found out based on his call logs. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=419.04s)]
*  He spoke to someone for 40 minutes after his passing we called him and found out he was [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=423.36s)]
*  doing this and it was next day after his last day at work. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=427.78s)]
*  Who did he speak to? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=432.24s)]
*  I'll get back to you on that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=433.24s)]
*  But he spoke to a reporter. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=435.44s)]
*  Canadian news media that sued OpenAI. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=436.44s)]
*  Canadian news media that sued OpenAI. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=440.84s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=443.84s)]
*  On October 23rd his interview was published in New York Times where he makes a very very [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=444.84s)]
*  open statement and he calls OpenAI violates copyright data. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=451.12s)]
*  On October 23rd he was quoted in the New York Times saying that OpenAI violates copyright [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=456.84s)]
*  law. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=462.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=463.08s)]
*  He's stealing other people's material. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=464.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=465.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  And what day did he die? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  What day did he die? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=471.32s)]
*  22nd November but we found a body on 26th November. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=472.32s)]
*  So he was quoted saying that OpenAI was committing crimes and a month later he was dead. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=479.56s)]
*  That's not just it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  On November 18th New York Times named my son as Custodian Witness. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=490.2s)]
*  Custodian Witness is very very important. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=497.32s)]
*  He had the documents against OpenAI. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=499.24s)]
*  That was on 18th, 22nd. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=502.8s)]
*  He just came back from vacation from LA and Catalina Island the same night. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  They have attacked him and killed him. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=510.48s)]
*  Tell us about what the New York Times wrote on November 18th. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=514.56s)]
*  We had these documents. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  What were the documents? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=519.96s)]
*  We need to get the documents from New York Times. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=520.96s)]
*  It's a sealed document. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not open for public but we need to become like the estate administrator. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=524.6800000000001s)]
*  My husband will be the estate administrator end of this month. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=529.72s)]
*  Then they will go and acquire the data. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=533.2s)]
*  What documents they were. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  At the moment we don't have information. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  But you know because you read it in the New York Times that your son had given journalists [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=539.12s)]
*  that he says implicated OpenAI in crime. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=545.44s)]
*  Yes and also on December 2nd Suchir had an interview planned with Associated Press, Matt [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=549.12s)]
*  Oberin. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  On December 2nd Suchir did not attend. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=557.5600000000001s)]
*  Third they called on his phone. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=560.5200000000001s)]
*  By then we had his phone. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=562.9000000000001s)]
*  My husband took a phone call and he found out that Suchir wanted to take legal action [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  against OpenAI. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=569.0s)]
*  He wanted to give the witness. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=570.6s)]
*  By then this news was not out yet that Suchir was a custodian witness but we got it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=572.4s)]
*  Then all we did was hurrying up the second autopsy, private autopsy movement. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=578.76s)]
*  We heard that this was his initiative and he didn't make it to do that. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=583.64s)]
*  So to bottom line it, it sounds like your son, who's your only child by the way and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=589.52s)]
*  I'm really sorry about that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=594.76s)]
*  Your son was in a position to threaten, really threaten OpenAI. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=598.24s)]
*  Well it's not, his intent was not to threaten. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=603.32s)]
*  He just cared about people. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=607.16s)]
*  He cared about humanity. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=608.72s)]
*  He writes in his article in New York Times as well as in publication. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=610.08s)]
*  He believes the way the AI is currently without any regulation is a harm to humanity. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=614.44s)]
*  He stood up for a cause and he lost his life for a cause. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=619.42s)]
*  He's a martyr. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  Obviously he's a martyr. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=623.5600000000001s)]
*  And then he never hesitated. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=625.76s)]
*  He took his, put his life at risk. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=627.56s)]
*  So the official cause of death is suicide. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  Your mother, clearly you spoke to him a lot. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=635.7199999999999s)]
*  Did you get any indication that he was depressed? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=638.5999999999999s)]
*  No, he just came back from vacation. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=640.92s)]
*  He had a very active lifestyle. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=643.4s)]
*  When we had his memorial service, many of his friends came and they gave the details [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  of when they met him and how many times they met him after he left. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=651.3599999999999s)]
*  He was visiting family. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=655.4s)]
*  We were going out for dinner, lunch. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=657.16s)]
*  He was fine. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  And more than anything else, he had concrete career plans. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=663.92s)]
*  And interviews scheduled and he had things on his to-do list. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=664.92s)]
*  Did he ever suggest to you, say to you that he felt his life was threatened? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=671.12s)]
*  Was he worried? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=676.56s)]
*  He had concrete plans. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=678.4s)]
*  He wanted to do some work for humanity. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  Just the last day when we spoke, last conversation with Suchir in person was that he had a non-profit [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=684.04s)]
*  in mind and he didn't want to take the salary for his work. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=689.68s)]
*  He said, mom, I have enough resources. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=693.48s)]
*  I don't even need to get paid. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=695.16s)]
*  I want to serve humanity. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=696.48s)]
*  And he wanted to work in neuroscience and machine learning combination. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=698.6s)]
*  Using that, I think I've seen on his desktop one of the projects for future of doctor visit. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=703.32s)]
*  Since we haven't unlocked his email and laptop yet, we have to discover that. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=708.7199999999999s)]
*  But we know he discussed with me. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=714.0s)]
*  It's a one-year plan. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  He said, give me one year time. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=717.56s)]
*  You'll know everything. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  Did he ever talk to you about Sam Altman? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=722.52s)]
*  Did you ever talk to your son about Sam Altman? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=727.16s)]
*  No, we refused to. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=729.0s)]
*  You refused to? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=731.0s)]
*  We refused to talk to Sam Altman. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=732.0s)]
*  But did your son ever talk to you about Sam Altman? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=734.04s)]
*  Did he ever say anything about Sam Altman? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=737.16s)]
*  Not to me, but to his friends a lot. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=739.04s)]
*  When he was in Catalina Islands, he spoke a lot against him. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  He literally didn't like him. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  In fact, I've seen his chat log saying that he wanted to work with Annie Altman in her [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=747.48s)]
*  non-profit work. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  And that would be Sam's sister who has accused him of sexual abuse. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=755.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=759.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=760.76s)]
*  He wrote that down. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=761.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=763.56s)]
*  He knew what personality Sam Altman had. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=764.9599999999999s)]
*  His main concerns were the lies. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=770.4s)]
*  The lies? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=773.56s)]
*  The lies that Sam Altman used to lie. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=774.56s)]
*  He was lying a lot. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=777.04s)]
*  My son is very ethical, and he couldn't stand it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=779.3599999999999s)]
*  If we could go to the timeline around your son's death. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=785.76s)]
*  He goes to Catalina Island with friends to backpack, to camp? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  Backpacking. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=794.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=795.4s)]
*  November 16 to November 22. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=796.4s)]
*  There were five guys who went, and my son was one of them. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=797.4s)]
*  All these are his middle school and high school classmates. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=801.48s)]
*  Some of them are his best buddies. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=805.64s)]
*  We spoke to every one of them when they came back, and everyone gave an image like he is [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=807.3199999999999s)]
*  upbeat, he was very happy. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=814.0799999999999s)]
*  He celebrated his 26th birthday on 21st November, the day before he died. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=816.84s)]
*  What more do we need to give an account of his happy mood? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=822.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=825.6s)]
*  At a certain age, you know people who have killed themselves. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=826.6s)]
*  Typically, the suicide follows a morose period of isolation. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=829.7600000000001s)]
*  The person is sitting alone in his apartment drinking. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=834.88s)]
*  He died the night he came back from a camping trip with his high school and college friends. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=838.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=843.4000000000001s)]
*  Our attorney, he came to his apartment with us, and the moment he inspected his apartment, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=844.4000000000001s)]
*  he said he had fresh supplies ordered. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=851.08s)]
*  He has so many pockets unopened. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  This doesn't look suicidal at all. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=855.64s)]
*  And the photographs that you took, which we'll get to in a minute, I just want to say this [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=860.1600000000001s)]
*  is not the first time I've been contacted by a family saying our child is ruled a suicide, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=865.6s)]
*  but we think it was a murder. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=871.5600000000001s)]
*  Many people have claimed that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=873.36s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this before. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  I think, again, to any fair person suggests that he was murdered. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=879.12s)]
*  But let's get to that. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=881.88s)]
*  So what do you know? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=883.08s)]
*  He came back from Catalina, and if you don't mind telling us what you know about what happened [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=884.08s)]
*  then. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=890.5600000000001s)]
*  He comes back that evening to San Francisco? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=891.5600000000001s)]
*  He came around like 11 o'clock. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=894.08s)]
*  He texted me his flight is taking off. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  That was on 22nd. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=897.96s)]
*  And then 4.54 he texted saying that it's pouring in San Francisco. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=899.9200000000001s)]

*  We'll inform you in five to six hours. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1121.94s)]
*  I said, I'm not going anywhere. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1123.9s)]

*  I cannot wait any longer. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1138.78s)]
*  And then at three twenty, I saw a big white van coming and my heart sank. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1141.3s)]
*  So they knew as they were speaking to you that your son was dead, but didn't tell you? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1147.74s)]
*  They didn't tell. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1151.1s)]

*  And you know what? They're asking me to go home. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1157.26s)]
*  And how I knew my son was dead is looking at the white van. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1161.7s)]
*  At that moment, I knew ambulance didn't come. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1166.54s)]
*  And instead of even then, I was optimistic. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1169.42s)]
*  OK, maybe ambulance wasn't available. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1172.3s)]
*  They sent another van. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1174.14s)]

*  That's how I came to know. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1184.54s)]
*  We first did a deal with Black Rifle Coffee. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1186.42s)]
*  Evan, the CEO, sent us like a case of coffee beans. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1188.54s)]

*  Nobody came out. He was all by himself. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1316.02s)]
*  And it's a suicide. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1320.18s)]
*  And how long it took, can you believe it? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1321.3s)]
*  40 minutes to investigate. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1323.58s)]
*  40 minutes to determine the cause of death. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1326.46s)]
*  And at four o'clock, they gave me the keys for the apartment [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1330.34s)]
*  and they say you can collect the body tomorrow. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1333.3s)]
*  Like right from that moment, I see fall play. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1336.74s)]
*  Proper formalities were not followed. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1340.5s)]
*  And the next day, they released the body within 24 hours [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1342.5s)]
*  without doing the complete autopsy. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1346.46s)]
*  They removed the bullet. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1348.94s)]
*  They did a CT scan, just returned the body to us. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1350.42s)]
*  Then we just checked with the funeral home and we discussed with them. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1353.74s)]
*  And then they also said, looks like it doesn't seem normal. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1358.26s)]
*  There's something very unusual here. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1361.1399999999999s)]
*  You should do a second private autopsy. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1363.3s)]
*  That's the funeral home suggested that. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1365.86s)]
*  Yes. And even we were thinking. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1368.26s)]
*  Both of us were also thinking funeral home also suggested [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1371.54s)]
*  we were shattered, obviously, right? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1374.34s)]
*  We were completely shattered. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1376.6599999999999s)]
*  We just didn't know what's going on and seeing our son like that. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1378.1399999999999s)]
*  And they said like his eyes are gone with the gun wound. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1382.06s)]
*  Don't see his face. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1385.82s)]
*  We couldn't see him. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1389.5s)]
*  But the fact that the funeral home, which, of course, sees dead bodies every day, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1391.86s)]
*  said to you, this doesn't look right, doesn't look like a suicide. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1396.86s)]
*  We recommend that you get a second autopsy, a real autopsy. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1399.94s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1403.78s)]
*  Actually, the way it's and they didn't look at the body, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1405.1s)]
*  they didn't look at any evidence. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1407.54s)]
*  But the way the information was given to us and the way the procedures [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1409.34s)]
*  and policies need to be followed and norms were not followed according to them. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1413.34s)]
*  Before they received the body itself, they said this doesn't look normal. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1418.6599999999999s)]
*  And we address the concern that it could be some fall play here. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1422.78s)]
*  And we knew from the very moment we heard the news, we know it's not suicide. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1427.06s)]
*  Next day, in the death news and I'm shattered, was calling police, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1431.3s)]
*  calling medical examiner, Corona's office, homicide unit. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1435.4199999999998s)]
*  We've done everything we can. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1440.3s)]
*  So tell me what you know about what's been proven from the CCTV, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1442.54s)]
*  from the surveillance footage about your son's last moments. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1450.06s)]
*  Is there any evidence anyone came in or out of the apartment? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1454.1399999999999s)]
*  No, actually, even when our attorney concluded it's a suicide, even at that moment, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1457.02s)]
*  I mentioned to the attorney, look, there are three entrances to this building. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1463.4199999999998s)]
*  One of them is gated, it has CCTV. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1467.8600000000001s)]
*  Other two entrances don't have CCTV. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1470.14s)]
*  And why are we ignoring that nobody came in, nobody went out? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1472.9s)]
*  And also what we just recently discovered is his packages are missing. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1476.94s)]
*  His roommate or no, his, you know, neighbor in the apartment complex, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1481.94s)]
*  he mentioned that in the, they have a shared package room, they have a shared bin [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1487.02s)]
*  or basket or something, he's seen such as packets until December 31st. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1491.0600000000002s)]
*  He reached out to me through Twitter on X platform. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1496.62s)]
*  When I tweeted, he found out I'm Suchu's mom and he said, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1499.62s)]
*  have you picked up Suchu's packages? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1502.94s)]
*  I don't see that after January 1st. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1504.58s)]
*  Those packages are missing. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1507.06s)]
*  When we talked to that neighbor, he said, like, it's very common that packages get lost. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1508.78s)]
*  In September, they received a notification that if you see so and so man, then let us know. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1514.86s)]
*  And that tells us a lot about the security. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1519.82s)]
*  And, you know, like, there's a compromise of key, there's a compromise of entrance. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1523.86s)]
*  All of these need to be investigated, obviously, when there is a murder. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1528.74s)]
*  So let's let's get to the reason that I am anxious to do this interview, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1533.74s)]
*  which is this report that you commissioned Dr. Dinesh Rao. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1538.4199999999998s)]
*  And it contains his analysis of the condition of your son's body [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1545.82s)]
*  based on an autopsy, I believe, and it critically contains seven crime scene [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1551.42s)]
*  photographs that you took in your son's apartment. Is that correct? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1556.46s)]
*  That's right. There are seven evidences that were very critical, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1559.42s)]
*  which has not been picked up by the authorities within 40 minutes. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1562.8999999999999s)]
*  They concluded they haven't even picked up critical things like a bag with blood [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1566.78s)]
*  that has my son's saliva in it. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1571.58s)]
*  They haven't picked that up. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1573.42s)]
*  And how could they miss haze falling all over from the wig? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1574.8999999999999s)]
*  Right. So that's that's what I want to get to. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1579.94s)]
*  So the two things that jump out to me, the first thing that jumps out, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1581.6599999999999s)]
*  and it's very obvious from the photographs that you took, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1585.6599999999999s)]
*  is that there's blood all over the apartment. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1589.06s)]
*  So the official explanation is that your son shot him. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1590.8999999999999s)]
*  And I'm sorry to I know this is hard. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1593.34s)]
*  But I think it's important to go through this. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1596.82s)]
*  The official explanation is your son shot himself once in the head [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1599.1s)]
*  and the bullet entered the brainstem and extinguished life immediately. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1602.26s)]
*  Can I say something? Yes. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1605.02s)]
*  It didn't touch his brainstem at all. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1607.14s)]
*  It didn't even touch his brain. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1610.26s)]
*  And the angle is downwards. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1611.7800000000002s)]
*  Yes. I'm saying the official explanation is he shot himself once in the head. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1614.22s)]
*  He died. Yes. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1617.18s)]
*  But these photographs show that that's not at all what happened [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1618.9s)]
*  because there's blood all over the apartment. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1621.98s)]
*  There's blood on the door, on the floor, in the bathroom. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1624.26s)]
*  There's blood everywhere. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1627.3000000000002s)]
*  So that right there, just employing common sense, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1629.5800000000002s)]
*  tells you that the person from whom that blood came, your son, presumably, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1634.22s)]
*  did not have a fatal brain injury, at least when he was bleeding. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1641.46s)]
*  I mean, this is something was going on in the apartment. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1645.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes. The second thing that jumps out is that there is a tuft of hair. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1647.5s)]
*  That's not hair. It's from a wig. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1654.5800000000002s)]
*  It's from a wig. And there's a clip scene. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1656.3400000000001s)]
*  It's OK. So tell us what that is for people who don't know. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1658.98s)]
*  It's a part of a clip in wig. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1661.42s)]
*  Like there's some kind of plastic band or something that would fit the wig on the head. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1663.34s)]
*  We can see that coming out behind the door. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1668.34s)]
*  Yes. And that's obvious evidence that no crime scene investigators or police can miss. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1670.82s)]
*  They just ignored everything that showed murder. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1677.22s)]
*  And they picked up everything that showed a cover up suicide. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1680.3s)]
*  But how could they ignore? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1683.26s)]
*  So your son did not mean he was a 26 year old man with short hair from pictures. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1684.3s)]
*  He's not wearing a wig, correct? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1689.26s)]
*  No, no, no, he is not. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1690.6599999999999s)]
*  And these hairs are not his. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1691.86s)]
*  This investigators analysis looked at the hair from the autopsy pictures that my son's hair and this hair. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1693.6999999999998s)]
*  This is not his hair. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1700.1799999999998s)]
*  And the and the portion of the wig, the clip in wig has blood on it. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1701.1s)]
*  Yes. OK. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1704.8999999999999s)]
*  So as a non forensic investigator myself, I look at that and I'm saying that's a that's a where did this come from? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1707.1s)]
*  And there's blood all over the apartment right there. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1713.86s)]
*  I would say this is, you know, maybe it's a suicide, but you're going to have to tell me how because that you know, what is that? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1718.02s)]
*  It's not a suicide. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1724.42s)]
*  It's a homicide. Obviously, we have enough reasons to believe that one is coming from the private autopsy. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1725.94s)]
*  It's not a suicidal angle at all. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1732.5s)]
*  So you said that. And let me let you explain. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1735.74s)]
*  It's not a suicidal angle. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1737.74s)]
*  So you had the the the crime scene. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1739.18s)]
*  Your son's body was taken away. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1743.34s)]
*  It was evaluated in some way by the authorities. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1744.8999999999999s)]
*  They say this is a suicide. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1747.18s)]
*  You have an like a real autopsy done by Professor Rao. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1748.3s)]
*  And he says, what about the bullet angle? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1752.94s)]
*  Will you explain that? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1755.3400000000001s)]
*  The autopsy was done by Dr. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1757.02s)]
*  Joseph Cohen. OK. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1758.66s)]
*  And he says two things. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1760.0600000000002s)]
*  One of them is the bullet angle is going downward about 30 to 45 degrees downward. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1762.38s)]
*  It's been shot here. It's missed the brain. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1768.0600000000002s)]
*  Second thing is, there's a head injury on the left side of the head. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1770.54s)]
*  In fact, I spoke to medical examiner's office, executive director. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1774.22s)]
*  I told him there's a head injury, the sign of struggle in the bathroom. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1778.66s)]
*  He just declared that I'm the decision making authority of state of California. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1783.34s)]
*  I decide the cause of death. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1789.02s)]
*  And when I brought up, we'll have federal investigation. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1790.9s)]
*  There was a moment that he said back in his voice on the phone, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1794.06s)]
*  but still they're holding on to suicide. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1797.1s)]
*  So Dr. Cohen's autopsy. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1799.46s)]
*  And this is grisly, I'm sorry. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1801.82s)]
*  But shows, demonstrates, proves that the bullet was fired at what angle? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1803.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's downward angle that someone cannot shoot themselves. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1809.46s)]
*  Right. So in other words, if this were a suicide, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1812.94s)]
*  your son would have had to have held the gun to his forehead. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1815.34s)]
*  Coming from the top. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1818.9s)]
*  He was made to sit. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1821.42s)]
*  If you look at the same thing, like the victim was sitting down, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1822.42s)]
*  he was made to sit someone standing, he shot him down. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1826.5s)]
*  In fact, like Balaji and my husband and I are going to create a virtual reality. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1829.3s)]
*  Once we get all the evidence, we'll create a virtual reality video [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1833.9s)]
*  and present it to court what exactly happened to him at that moment. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1837.14s)]
*  You also said, if I heard you correctly, that he had another head injury [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1842.26s)]
*  not caused by a bullet. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1845.62s)]
*  Yes. Can you tell us about that? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1847.06s)]
*  Actually, it appeared to us that from his fallen [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1849.74s)]
*  tooth and the blood in the sink and all that, it appeared around 10 ish. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1852.9s)]
*  Because 1010 is his last browser history on the desktop. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1859.3s)]
*  He was brushing his teeth before going to bed. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1862.94s)]
*  He was attacked from behind on the head. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1865.42s)]
*  That's where this fallen dustbin, this fallen toothpick [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1868.98s)]
*  and his earbud has fallen in two different directions because of the head impact. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1872.46s)]
*  And we believe after that, he was either electrocuted [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1877.3799999999999s)]
*  or he was, you know, like he was paralyzed from the head injury. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1881.46s)]
*  And then he just they just held him up, made him sit and shot him. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1885.82s)]
*  But also we know that that we're waiting for further report, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1889.62s)]
*  but that may not be the cause of death. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1895.18s)]
*  The gunshot wound is not the cause of death. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1898.62s)]
*  And probably they might have suffocated him. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1901.02s)]
*  We don't have any details of that cruelty, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1904.86s)]
*  but we're waiting for further reports from CT scan. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1907.54s)]
*  Why do you believe the gunshot was not the cause of death? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1910.46s)]
*  Because it's not touched the brain. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1913.62s)]
*  It only causes makes him unconscious. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1915.3s)]
*  So the autopsy show that the bullet did not touch his brain. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1920.26s)]
*  Yes. And also, since I called the apartment on 12 on 23rd at 12 15 p.m., [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1923.58s)]
*  it rang once and it went to voicemail. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1929.62s)]
*  That makes me believe. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1933.18s)]
*  The killers were still there in the apartment. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1937.46s)]
*  Again, we need to verify all that we can do something called geofencing. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1939.86s)]
*  Through that, we can figure out who was there, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1943.62s)]
*  who was visiting that complex and all that information. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1945.62s)]
*  That's exactly why we need thorough investigation. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1948.8200000000002s)]
*  You certainly do. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1953.1000000000001s)]
*  You said your son's last browser record is from 10 p.m. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1955.14s)]
*  ish. 10 10 p.m. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1960.18s)]
*  And what was he looking at? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1962.26s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1964.14s)]
*  I think he was looking at a black cat or something, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1967.18s)]
*  because last time in Sucher and I met, a cat was going in front of me. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1970.6200000000001s)]
*  And then I told him it's a superstition. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1975.26s)]
*  And then he was looking at neuroscience topics. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1977.1s)]
*  And he logged into a website for those, you know, for the start up or something like that. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1982.74s)]
*  He logged into a website and he was doing some research. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1987.06s)]
*  So he wasn't looking up, how do I kill myself? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1992.98s)]
*  Oh, no, that's the first thing that we look for, actually. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1995.34s)]
*  Of course, of course, of course. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=1998.82s)]
*  I mean, killing yourself is a, you know, a profound decision. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2001.4599999999998s)]
*  People, their signs. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2004.82s)]
*  And can I say something? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2006.9s)]
*  It doesn't add up if he's so brave to go to news media to be a witness. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2008.3s)]
*  He's so courageous. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2014.06s)]
*  How does someone so courageous and do a cowardly act? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2015.54s)]
*  It doesn't add up at all. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2019.66s)]
*  What doesn't add up is there's blood all over the apartment. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2022.06s)]
*  And there's a piece of a wig on the ground covered in blood. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2024.6200000000001s)]
*  That's not his wig. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2029.22s)]
*  And, you know, you don't need to be a detective to imagine [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2031.02s)]
*  that if someone's going to commit a murder, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2035.1s)]
*  he might be wearing a wig as he goes into the apartment. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2037.34s)]
*  So that right there, considering your son didn't wear a wig [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2039.6999999999998s)]
*  as a 26 year old male. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2044.3s)]
*  You know, his were not his. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2047.34s)]
*  That's also another thing. What weren't his? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2048.5s)]
*  Those hairs were not his hair. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2050.46s)]
*  We have the picture of his hairs. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2052.46s)]
*  His hair is fallen down in the bathroom sink. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2054.8199999999997s)]
*  That is different from the wig in the hair in the wig. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2057.22s)]
*  His original hair have been found on the floor. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2059.86s)]
*  They might have strangled him by his hair or something. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2066.02s)]
*  His hair has fallen down. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2069.3s)]
*  That hair versus the wig hair are different. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2071.2200000000003s)]
*  Did anybody hear anything in the apartment? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2077.26s)]
*  Did anyone hear the gunshot? No, no one heard anything. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2079.86s)]
*  No one heard anything. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2082.78s)]
*  And two entrances into the complex have no surveillance cameras. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2084.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2089.38s)]
*  Wow. It makes the hair in your arms go up. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2092.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2095.62s)]
*  Yeah. Again, I've been involved in many stories like this, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2097.54s)]
*  more than five, and I've never seen one like this. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2101.2200000000003s)]
*  It's brutal. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2103.98s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2105.1800000000003s)]
*  So what's unbelievable is it's so obviously not a clean cut story. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2106.46s)]
*  I mean, you wouldn't walk into an apartment with blood splattered everywhere [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2112.02s)]
*  and see a man on the floor with a gun in his hand and say, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2115.86s)]
*  oh, it was a suicide. Well, how did the blood get in the bathroom? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2118.22s)]
*  He shot himself in the head. Like, that doesn't even make sense. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2120.54s)]
*  It was a cover up, right? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2123.02s)]
*  So they picked up what they want to pick up. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2124.54s)]
*  We don't know if they have been instructed to do this beforehand. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2126.46s)]
*  So, OK, let's thank you for describing all of that. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2130.22s)]
*  And I'm sorry, I know it's awful. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2133.74s)]
*  Yeah. But tell me how the authorities responded, if you don't mind. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2135.74s)]
*  Authorities have been very indifferent. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2142.06s)]
*  In fact, we hired an attorney, a senior attorney. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2145.02s)]
*  He wrote to chief of police, city administrator, chief medical examiner, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2147.54s)]
*  executive director of medical examiner. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2153.38s)]
*  He wrote very clearly a couple of points. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2156.54s)]
*  One of them is he was not suicidal. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2159.14s)]
*  Before making a decision of suicide, they need to take his mental state into account. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2161.02s)]
*  Yes. He has happy pictures. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2165.34s)]
*  They shared the pictures. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2167.7799999999997s)]
*  He just came back and he said, talk to four of his friends who accompanied him. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2168.7799999999997s)]
*  And he also said the autopsy information in that letter. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2173.46s)]
*  The autopsy report says that this is the angle of gunshot. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2176.62s)]
*  It doesn't look suicidal at all. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2179.62s)]
*  A doctor described this as atypical, abnormal, worrisome angle. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2181.9s)]
*  We wrote all of this to them. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2187.02s)]
*  We just had them to reconsider it and do the investigation. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2188.7s)]
*  Chief of police apparently has agreed to do investigation, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2194.5s)]
*  but medical examiner stopped it. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2198.5s)]
*  He said, no, this is suicide. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2200.1s)]
*  And the attorney came back and said what they said was, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2201.34s)]
*  oh, yeah, the angle looks different. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2204.34s)]
*  So what? It's a suicide. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2206.06s)]
*  A man shooting himself in the forehead from a downward angle. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2209.1s)]
*  Yeah, OK. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2212.54s)]
*  I'm not even sure if that's possible, but we're going to demonstrate that. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2214.98s)]
*  We just ordered a dummy gun. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2219.14s)]
*  We're going to create a dummy of his size and we're going to demonstrate using the VR. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2220.7799999999997s)]
*  That is the video we're going to demonstrate to people. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2225.38s)]
*  It's not possible. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2227.9s)]
*  Who is the medical examiner who refuses to reconsider a pretty obviously silly explanation for this? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2228.82s)]
*  His name is David Hellman. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2236.86s)]
*  David Hellman is the San Francisco medical examiner. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2239.46s)]
*  But he has been covered by David Sewell, who is the executive director. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2242.14s)]
*  Every time we call, it's him. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2246.34s)]
*  And even the news report is given by David Sewell. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2248.54s)]
*  There's no foul play. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2252.2599999999998s)]
*  And who is David Sewell? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2253.34s)]
*  He's the executive director of medical examiner's office. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2254.98s)]
*  He is the one who's holding on to suicide despite of seeing all the evidences. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2258.2599999999998s)]
*  He wants to declare it only suicide, nothing else. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2263.66s)]
*  What does he make of the bloody wig and the blood splattered in the bathroom [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2268.38s)]
*  when your son was not found in the bathroom? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2272.62s)]
*  Like, how does he explain that? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2274.06s)]
*  He didn't want to listen to it. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2276.22s)]
*  He didn't want to pay attention to any of the things that we were saying. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2278.1s)]
*  And you know, the worst struggle here is the first attorney. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2280.98s)]
*  He was reluctant to help us when he said so. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2284.5s)]
*  When medical examiner's office said suicide, he didn't want to fight because they have been threatened. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2286.94s)]
*  And obviously, then we hired a second attorney. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2292.82s)]
*  He got a crime scene investigator. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2296.1800000000003s)]
*  And our attorney said, we'll give you explanation of every blood mark. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2299.54s)]
*  And he came back this Monday and he gave explanation. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2305.98s)]
*  And none of that explanation he gave corroborates to what happened in the apartment based on [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2310.6200000000003s)]
*  what we see. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2314.94s)]
*  That means even the crime scene investigator was bought. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2315.94s)]
*  He gave inaccurate results. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2319.78s)]
*  If both the attorneys are like this, then where do we go? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2322.82s)]
*  We definitely need some serious help here from the authorities. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2325.46s)]
*  Okay, so the authorities would begin with the mayor of San Francisco. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2329.7400000000002s)]
*  Mayor of San Francisco. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2333.2200000000003s)]
*  Actually, Sam Altman is on the transition committee for the new governor. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2335.82s)]
*  He's the friend of... [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2341.02s)]
*  The new mayor. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2342.02s)]
*  The new mayor. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2343.02s)]
*  Sam Altman is a friend of the new mayor. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2344.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2346.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2347.02s)]
*  So let's move up. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2348.02s)]
*  Then you go to the governor of California, Kevin Newsom. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2349.02s)]
*  We're trying to. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2350.02s)]
*  We're trying to. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2351.2599999999998s)]
*  We're first trying to meet the district attorney of San Francisco, DA of San Francisco. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2352.2599999999998s)]
*  We probably are going to get an appointment sometime next week or later this week. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2356.62s)]
*  It's mid-January. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2361.2599999999998s)]
*  Your son was killed in November. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2362.2599999999998s)]
*  We're not been getting any appointment. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2363.82s)]
*  We wrote to everyone. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2366.18s)]
*  We wrote to Rob Bonta. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2367.94s)]
*  We wrote to DA. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2368.94s)]
*  Like we didn't get any appointment from any of them. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2369.94s)]
*  Five weeks were wasted by our first attorney. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2375.02s)]
*  He does nothing. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2377.66s)]
*  He just keeps prolonging, prolonging, prolonging. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2379.02s)]
*  He wasted five weeks. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2381.7s)]
*  Then we hired a second attorney. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2383.22s)]
*  It's been almost two weeks since we hired. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2385.18s)]
*  But now like we just didn't trust any of these people. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2387.86s)]
*  We got a report from someone else. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2390.58s)]
*  And now we're coming to media because these people like none... [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2392.86s)]
*  Neither the authorities nor the attorneys are helping us. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2395.58s)]
*  This needs to go to the Department of Justice, I think, in the Trump administration? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2399.82s)]
*  I did write. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2403.2599999999998s)]
*  You did? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2404.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2405.62s)]
*  We haven't heard yet because it's only been a few days. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2406.62s)]
*  We did write to them. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2408.62s)]
*  In general, possessions are overrated. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2410.2599999999998s)]
*  But there are some things you really would not want stolen. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2413.54s)]
*  And to me, family shotguns, including a whole bunch of them I got from my father, are at [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2417.18s)]
*  the top of that list. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2422.66s)]
*  So I keep my dad's shotguns in a Liberty Safe because it's safe and it's also really attractive. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2423.98s)]
*  Liberty Safe just created something really cool. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2431.5s)]
*  It's a limited edition safe that commemorates the inauguration of Donald Trump, America's [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2433.18s)]
*  47th president. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2438.06s)]
*  The original design celebrates Trump and his swearing in while upholding Liberty's commitment [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2439.06s)]
*  to building their safes right here in the United States. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2444.14s)]
*  And they went all out on this one. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2446.7s)]
*  It's the special 47 edition. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2448.4599999999996s)]
*  It features a one of a kind artwork that pays homage to the president. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2450.66s)]
*  It's very, very cool. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2454.8199999999997s)]
*  Not all safes are created equal. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2456.68s)]
*  There are plenty out there. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2457.8999999999996s)]
*  And a lot of the manufacturers slap an American sending name on the label, but they are not [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2458.8999999999996s)]
*  made here. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2463.7799999999997s)]
*  They're from China or other foreign markets. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2464.7799999999997s)]
*  Liberty safes are made in the United States. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2467.22s)]
*  For over 30 years, Liberty has made its safes right here and that matters because when you [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2469.7799999999997s)]
*  buy a Liberty Safe, you're supporting American workers and American values. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2474.8199999999997s)]
*  Their products are more than just a place to protect your dead shotguns, for example. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2478.66s)]
*  They are a symbol of this country. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2482.4199999999996s)]
*  So celebrate this historic moment. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2484.24s)]
*  Secure the things that you want to keep forever in a Liberty Safe. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2486.58s)]
*  Visit LibertySafe.com or find a Liberty dealer or retailer near you to order your limited [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2491.22s)]
*  edition safe today. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2496.5s)]
*  Liberty Safe made in America. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2497.5s)]
*  Has anybody in a position of authority in the state of California said to you, boy, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2501.5s)]
*  this needs more investigation? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2506.7200000000003s)]
*  It doesn't look right. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2507.7200000000003s)]
*  Everybody is suppressed. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2509.86s)]
*  No one has come in our favor. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2511.66s)]
*  In fact, even our attorneys whom we hired have been made to tell it's a suicide to us. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2513.18s)]
*  Every day from every different angle, there is a push for us that it's a suicide. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2518.42s)]
*  But we parents, we know and we want to fight for justice for our beloved son. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2523.54s)]
*  But I don't understand on what basis. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2527.94s)]
*  So your son had just come back that day from hanging out with his buddies. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2530.18s)]
*  OK, so which is like a happy thing. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2534.54s)]
*  No evidence that he was suicidal whatsoever and tons of forensic evidence that he was [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2537.98s)]
*  murdered. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2543.18s)]
*  So on what grounds are they saying it's very likely he killed himself? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2544.18s)]
*  OK, that's because of the cover up. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2546.94s)]
*  Remember, like there was a gun near him. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2548.5s)]
*  He owned a gun and they put a shell casing and four bullets near it. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2550.5s)]
*  They made it look like it. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2555.06s)]
*  So there are both the evidences, right? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2556.62s)]
*  For the medical examiner to pick up, he picked up the one that looks suicidal. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2558.5s)]
*  He ignored the one that looks like homicide. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2562.76s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2565.78s)]
*  So now to Sam Altman. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2568.86s)]
*  What contact with Sam Altman have you had since your son died? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2571.66s)]
*  We contacted HR for 401k plan details. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2576.26s)]
*  Until then, no one from OpenAI ever contacted us. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2580.54s)]
*  They gave the PR report that they are supporting the family. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2584.3s)]
*  How? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2587.06s)]
*  Suchir obviously put parents in his emergency contact, right? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2588.06s)]
*  They got the dead news on December 13th. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2591.74s)]
*  They made no attempt to contact us. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2594.04s)]
*  And when we reached out to HR, Sam Altman said he wants to talk to us. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2596.22s)]
*  By then we already knew Suchir was, you know, his presence or his living would have been [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2601.06s)]
*  a threat to AI industry in general. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2606.38s)]
*  I wouldn't want to name one company, but eventually it's going to expose everything, right? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2608.42s)]
*  So we didn't want to talk to Sam Altman. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2613.64s)]
*  And then they said we provide employee assistance program. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2615.54s)]
*  Though he was a former employee, we said we have medical insurance, we don't need it. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2619.22s)]
*  Then they pushed us saying we want to get you on a Zoom call ASAP to go over his stock [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2623.66s)]
*  options. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2629.2599999999998s)]
*  Then our response to that is, why are you in a hurry? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2630.5800000000004s)]
*  We are not. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2634.0200000000004s)]
*  We've lost our son. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2635.0200000000004s)]
*  We're grieving. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2636.0200000000004s)]
*  Money is not important to us. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2637.0200000000004s)]
*  Please talk to a private attorney. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2638.5800000000004s)]
*  And we had a private attorney talk to the HR. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2640.0600000000004s)]
*  This is our only- [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2643.7400000000002s)]
*  They wanted to talk about his stock options? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2644.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2646.26s)]
*  That's why they wanted to get us on a Zoom call. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2647.26s)]
*  Do you think, do you believe, you can't know, I guess, but do you think that Sam Altman [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2652.1000000000004s)]
*  was involved in your son's death? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2657.6200000000003s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2659.2200000000003s)]
*  We need to investigate it. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2660.22s)]
*  We can't say anything at this time. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2661.7s)]
*  But one thing I know for sure is, if he was deposed, there are a few organizations who [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2665.18s)]
*  could have been impacted for that matter. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2672.74s)]
*  Like there are a lot of AI companies which violate copyright law. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2675.18s)]
*  And we don't know what OpenAI wanted to hide when my son deposed. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2678.98s)]
*  What was the wrongdoing that he would have brought up? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2685.2999999999997s)]
*  Not just the copyright law. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2687.7s)]
*  That's exactly we need FBI to investigate thoroughly. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2689.18s)]
*  Was there any criminal activity? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2692.7799999999997s)]
*  Was there any illegal activity? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2696.7799999999997s)]
*  We don't know, right? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2698.18s)]
*  Why? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2699.7s)]
*  Why would they silence him? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2700.7s)]
*  What would he have spoken? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2701.7s)]
*  If it's just a copyright law, do you think these big organizations like Microsoft and [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2702.7s)]
*  OpenAI care? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2707.5s)]
*  No, they don't care about it, right? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2708.5s)]
*  Because they have money and power. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2710.54s)]
*  What else was involved in the deposition, in the testimony that took my son's life? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2712.2999999999997s)]
*  We need thorough investigation. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2717.3399999999997s)]
*  So you haven't seen those documents. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2718.94s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2720.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, there are two things here. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2721.7400000000002s)]
*  One is the custodial documentation, right? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2724.2200000000003s)]
*  The second thing is his own statement. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2726.34s)]
*  His own statement we heard from few former employees of OpenAI. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2729.26s)]
*  There are certain wrongdoings there. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2733.02s)]
*  Like what? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2738.2200000000003s)]
*  We can't say something that someone shared, right? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2739.2200000000003s)]
*  So I would want to keep it more, you know, just overview that something like that. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2742.06s)]
*  So that is the reason they're hiding. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2749.34s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2751.18s)]
*  If we come and tell openly, our life could be at risk. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2752.18s)]
*  But we are taking the risk and coming out and telling publicly that the reason our son [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2754.94s)]
*  was killed, because he knew something that was going on, keeping in mind he was feeding [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2759.38s)]
*  the data, right? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2765.14s)]
*  Pre-training data. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2767.58s)]
*  So to be clear, you think this is not simply about OpenAI stealing copyrighted material. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2769.1s)]
*  There's more than that. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2777.02s)]
*  More than that. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2778.02s)]
*  100% sure. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2779.02s)]
*  Because copyright data, obviously my friends and I were all talking, these companies, they [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2780.02s)]
*  get many lawsuits like this, right? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2784.06s)]
*  Do they really care about it? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2785.98s)]
*  No. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2789.02s)]
*  What is the kind of thing they do care about? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2790.02s)]
*  What kind of crimes do you think they would kill someone over? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2792.2999999999997s)]
*  They might be stealing some data that could cause a violation, possibly. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2798.62s)]
*  They might be stealing some data. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2802.94s)]
*  From the US government, from other government? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2805.54s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2807.7799999999997s)]
*  Maybe government is involved, we don't know. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2809.8199999999997s)]
*  We are speculating. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2811.7s)]
*  That's just a remarkable story. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2812.7s)]
*  Do you think that we will find out? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2818.2999999999997s)]
*  How will the rest of us find out what your son testified to? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2820.54s)]
*  That's exactly why we call out to President Trump to do a thorough investigation. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2826.58s)]
*  We want a FBI director to be assigned to investigate this. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2831.86s)]
*  This is not just about copyright. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2836.46s)]
*  This is about a lot of other things that are going on that could cause harm to society [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2838.38s)]
*  potentially, not just my son's death. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2843.2999999999997s)]
*  There's something harmful that needs to be evaluated and thoroughly investigated. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2846.1s)]
*  That's exactly why they're covering up a suicide. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2852.38s)]
*  Why do you think medical examiners, the executive director, would come and tell? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2855.18s)]
*  Why do you think nobody gives us appointments? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2858.54s)]
*  Because there's some kind of foul play and there's strong power behind medical examiner. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2861.06s)]
*  So you're saying that AI itself poses a threat to the world and that your son understood this? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2868.3799999999997s)]
*  Yes, he understood it. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2876.3799999999997s)]
*  But he was keeping in mind that's one aspect. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2877.7s)]
*  The other aspect is he knew everything open AI does. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2879.8199999999997s)]
*  He might have actually felt overwhelmed by what kind of activity he got involved in. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2883.98s)]
*  We know that he spoke to a copyright attorney, which is again a cover-up, we suspect. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2891.7400000000002s)]
*  And what Matthew Butterick told us on November 29th is, yes, I met with your son. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2897.06s)]
*  He's a very brave man. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2902.62s)]
*  So Chir told us what open AI did to him. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2904.42s)]
*  He didn't say anything beyond that. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2908.62s)]
*  That day he said, I live in San Francisco, LA. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2909.98s)]
*  I come to San Francisco quite a few times and I'm going to talk to you next time when I come. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2913.6200000000003s)]
*  And then he's been silenced. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2918.2200000000003s)]
*  He's not telling us anything. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2919.2200000000003s)]
*  We had our attorney call. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2921.1800000000003s)]
*  Even then, apparently he did not say. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2923.0600000000004s)]
*  So if we depose him, he's going to spill out everything. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2925.54s)]
*  And also we suspect he's Sam Altman's friend and he's played against our son and has indirect [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2928.94s)]
*  involvement. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2934.54s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2935.54s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2938.54s)]
*  There was a moment where Sam Altman left his own company or seemed to leave his own company [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2940.94s)]
*  for a few days. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2945.18s)]
*  You may remember this. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2946.18s)]
*  What was that? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2947.38s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2948.38s)]
*  Sam Altman was fired. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2949.38s)]
*  This was because of AI safety issues. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2950.38s)]
*  The board of directors for Open AI from the nonprofit side, especially one called Ilya [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2952.98s)]
*  Sesto, he and others, excuse me, fired Sam Altman. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2958.66s)]
*  And then all the 700 employees, including my son, wrote a letter or a momentum saying [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2964.38s)]
*  that if they don't reinstate Sam Altman, they're all going to resign. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2970.14s)]
*  So they brought Sam Altman. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2974.46s)]
*  They fired Ilya, who's an AI safety expert. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2976.04s)]
*  And to be honest, a few days after my son's death was announced, December 15th, Ilya was [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2981.02s)]
*  seen in a presentation in one of the conferences. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2985.7s)]
*  He had two security guards with firearms around him. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2989.7599999999998s)]
*  He was so scared of his life. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2994.74s)]
*  So we are seeing a mafia behind all these things, honestly speaking. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=2996.74s)]
*  What were the safety issues that caused Sam Altman to get fired, do you think? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3002.62s)]
*  We don't know if it's a safety issue or whatever. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3008.22s)]
*  We don't have the details of it. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3011.58s)]
*  Even my son doesn't know any of these things. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3013.58s)]
*  In fact, he supported Sam Altman's reinstatement. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3015.7s)]
*  Yes, you said that. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3017.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3019.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3020.9799999999996s)]
*  Like a lot of AI safety people have been leaving Open AI. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3021.9799999999996s)]
*  If you notice their CTO, Meera, I don't know her last name. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3024.94s)]
*  Their CTO also resigned. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3028.86s)]
*  Many people have been leaving Open AI, not just the researchers. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3030.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3034.9s)]
*  That's exactly I want to know why. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3037.9s)]
*  There's so many people to leave. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3042.02s)]
*  Obviously, there is something, right, that they're not happy about, right? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3043.78s)]
*  Only person who spoke against them was my son. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3048.78s)]
*  Most of them just quietly walked away. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3051.62s)]
*  My son, he couldn't take it. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3053.38s)]
*  He felt like he needed to stand up and tell the truth so some harm can be prevented. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3055.62s)]
*  We need to investigate all this seriously. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3060.62s)]
*  Did your son ever mention, during that period when Sam Altman left, that very brief period, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3066.94s)]
*  there was a report in the news media that said within Open AI, AI itself was being worshiped [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3072.2200000000003s)]
*  like a god. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3080.52s)]
*  Did he ever mention anything about that? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3082.58s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3084.34s)]
*  Suchi didn't mention. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3085.34s)]
*  And do you have any sense of what these harms are? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3087.74s)]
*  I mean, clearly people are afraid of what AI can do, not just by eliminating jobs, which [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3090.66s)]
*  is enough to worry about, but there are other things that people are very concerned about. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3095.8199999999997s)]
*  Do you know what they are? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3099.38s)]
*  They are in my son's publication. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3101.14s)]
*  Some of them he's covered. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3103.34s)]
*  One of them is like less traffic means the loss of jobs. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3104.46s)]
*  That was one of his concerns. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3108.88s)]
*  I'm proud of him for bringing that up. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3110.22s)]
*  He gave the graphical representation of how the traffic is reduced to stack overflow and [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3113.34s)]
*  fuser website that are a means of living for people. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3118.1s)]
*  That will be taken away. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3121.7s)]
*  That's his concern. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3122.7s)]
*  And also the accuracy, as I mentioned earlier in the interview, the accuracy of data. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3123.7s)]
*  And also he says something called like the modulation index or something, 0.5 versus [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3127.76s)]
*  1.0. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3135.86s)]
*  In his article, if it's 0.5, the data in and data out are not the same. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3136.86s)]
*  If it's one data in and data out are same. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3142.6600000000003s)]
*  Most companies, including OpenAI use 0.5. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3146.9s)]
*  That means the data accuracy is not maintained. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3150.06s)]
*  That is his biggest concern. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3152.5s)]
*  He being kind of like an architect inside, he knows in and out of chat, GPT. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3153.82s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3161.86s)]
*  If my son were alive, he was planning to bring a competition to OpenAI. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3165.14s)]
*  He was working on a medical startup. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3169.66s)]
*  I even checked with him. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3171.22s)]
*  How do you think it's a competition? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3172.22s)]
*  Not directly. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3173.74s)]
*  Mom, it's an indirect competition, he said. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3174.74s)]
*  He would have been a great humanitarian. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3177.1s)]
*  He would have done a lot of causes for humanity with the concerns he had. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3180.94s)]
*  We lost a great human being, not just my son, who would have made a big difference to the [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3185.06s)]
*  world. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3190.42s)]
*  Now, what we want is we want justice. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3191.42s)]
*  We want death sentence to the one who killed my son, as well as imprisonment for people [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3194.42s)]
*  who are behind it. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3200.3s)]
*  We don't know who it is, but we want to know. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3201.3s)]
*  We want to know what my son stood against and take actions, at least in honor of him. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3203.86s)]
*  At least do something that he stood for and let his soul be at peace. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3209.58s)]
*  What happened to the piece of wig found on the floor soaked in blood in your son's apartment? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3216.62s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3220.5s)]
*  It's still there. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3221.5s)]
*  We want police to go and look at it. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3222.58s)]
*  It's in the apartment right now? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3224.58s)]
*  Nobody came to do the investigation. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3226.46s)]
*  We have the apartment case. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3229.58s)]
*  Nobody came to do the investigation. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3231.14s)]
*  We have been requesting police. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3232.62s)]
*  It's sitting there right now? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3233.98s)]
*  Yeah, still there. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3234.98s)]
*  We didn't pick up anything because it's crime scene evidence. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3235.98s)]
*  But no one's investigating it as a crime scene? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3240.14s)]
*  No. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3242.42s)]
*  In fact, like our attorney said, up to December 31st, these people will retain the apartment. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3243.42s)]
*  In fact, we are paying the rent and we are maintaining the apartment as is because we [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3249.3s)]
*  want someone to come and investigate all these things with so much evidence. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3253.2200000000003s)]
*  If medical examiner still calls it suicide, this is an ethical question, the regulatory [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3258.38s)]
*  question. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3264.0600000000004s)]
*  So it's just sitting on the floor right now? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3265.0600000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3268.78s)]
*  It's the same place. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3269.78s)]
*  We didn't touch any of that. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3270.78s)]
*  This is a really crazy story. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3273.42s)]
*  It is. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3275.98s)]
*  Reality, right? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3276.98s)]
*  It's not a story. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3278.66s)]
*  It's how gruesome it is. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3279.66s)]
*  And like you see all the bloodshot, like there was a fight and my son has been tortured. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3281.66s)]
*  He didn't die immediately. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3285.82s)]
*  And where can we go with various peace of mind for us? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3288.58s)]
*  We can't, we just don't have any peace of mind. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3292.1s)]
*  Our life is not normal at all. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3294.54s)]
*  The only thing that could make a difference after the loss of our son is getting justice, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3296.78s)]
*  punish the wrongdoers, protect AI. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3302.82s)]
*  Did you know that California was this corrupt? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3305.38s)]
*  Yeah, we know it's very corrupt. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3308.58s)]
*  That's exactly why we're requesting FBI thorough investigation. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3312.62s)]
*  We didn't speak to an agent, I think last Friday. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3315.82s)]
*  We're waiting for that agent to get someone assigned if we know special agent or something. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3319.42s)]
*  And we also know that there's a transition period in the government. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3324.58s)]
*  Some may be moved, transferred, some may be leaving. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3328.58s)]
*  So we just thought, okay, let's wait. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3331.02s)]
*  Meanwhile, we did all the groundwork that we needed to do. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3333.98s)]
*  We have the evidence. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3336.5s)]
*  We are here in the media. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3337.5s)]
*  We're telling the media now we want a new oncoming federal government to intervene because Newsom, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3338.5s)]
*  we know Trump himself makes a lot of statements against Newsom. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3343.58s)]
*  We wrote to Rokana. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3348.2999999999997s)]
*  You talked to Rokana, a congressman from Silicon Valley. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3351.1s)]
*  We wrote to him. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3353.58s)]
*  No response from him. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3354.7s)]
*  Many people tried to reach out to him. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3355.8199999999997s)]
*  Not one, many people. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3359.62s)]
*  No response from him. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3361.74s)]
*  Because they're all inside, right? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3362.74s)]
*  All this tech lobbying. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3364.9799999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3365.9799999999996s)]
*  I'm going to, you know what? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3366.9799999999996s)]
*  I'm going to text Rokana right now. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3369.9799999999996s)]
*  Please do. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3372.4599999999996s)]
*  I'm going to. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3373.4599999999996s)]

*  And Rokana has not responded to you? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3378.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3383.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3384.9799999999996s)]
*  I sent out, I filled in a form in his website. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3387.9799999999996s)]
*  I gave my phone number. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3391.78s)]
*  I gave all the details on his website. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3392.78s)]
*  Many people from whom we know have tried to contact Rokana. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3395.0600000000004s)]
*  They took my email address and they said Rokana will reach. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3398.2200000000003s)]
*  It's been two weeks. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3401.1400000000003s)]
*  He hasn't reached us. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3402.1400000000003s)]
*  Initially, we thought it's holiday time. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3403.1400000000003s)]
*  So he's a little busy, but even it's 14th of January today. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3405.7200000000003s)]
*  No response yet. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3410.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3413.3s)]
*  I'm going to, I just texted him right now. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3416.34s)]
*  And I just sent him pictures of the relevant information. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3421.5s)]
*  And I hope that you'll try again. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3426.78s)]
*  I mean, Rokana is the Silicon Valley member of Congress. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3427.78s)]
*  We don't believe in state government at all. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3432.54s)]
*  We know how corrupt it is, especially in San Francisco Bay Area. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3435.1800000000003s)]
*  It's very, very corrupt. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3439.82s)]
*  We don't believe in the system. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3441.3s)]
*  Unless, you know, we change the governor, we wouldn't believe anything will happen here. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3443.26s)]
*  We need to go to federal. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3448.38s)]
*  And we also found out that he's protected in the whistleblower act as well. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3449.5400000000004s)]
*  You found out that what? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3452.86s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3454.34s)]
*  Whistleblower. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3455.34s)]
*  There's a federal aspect as well. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3456.34s)]
*  It's not just the state. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3457.34s)]
*  Yeah, he's a whistleblower. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3458.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3459.34s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3460.34s)]
*  There are two things here. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3461.34s)]
*  One is wrongful death. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3462.34s)]
*  One is a whistleblower. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3463.34s)]
*  The whistleblower comes in the federal because the lawsuit was filed in New York and he was [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3464.34s)]
*  a custodian witness. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3466.5800000000004s)]
*  So we have a backing from federal government involvement. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3468.0400000000004s)]
*  If it's just the state, corrupt state would fight against it. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3470.86s)]
*  Since it is federal, they can overtake the federal aspect. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3474.26s)]
*  We are writing to the Federal Trade Commission now, today or tomorrow. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3478.1s)]
*  And we want them to do a quiet investigation of the case. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3483.7000000000003s)]
*  We have a top attorney in whistleblowers that's helping us, through one of Maine's contingency [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3487.34s)]
*  bases. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3492.1800000000003s)]
*  We will work with him and bring the truth out. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3493.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, your son was born in this country. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3496.06s)]
*  You can't murder American citizens because they're standing in the way of your business. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3499.18s)]
*  That is not allowed in this country. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3503.14s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3504.8599999999997s)]
*  Imagine we are immigrants here and we came here, we raised our son, we were so proud [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3505.8599999999997s)]
*  of him. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3512.02s)]
*  We don't expect this to happen in this country, in America. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3513.5s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3518.14s)]
*  We don't expect this to happen. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3520.58s)]
*  Like, sense of security has been lost for me ever since. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3521.94s)]
*  Do you worry about your safety? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3526.22s)]
*  Potentially, now that we've gone so public, they may not target us. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3528.26s)]
*  But there might be some kind of threat in terms of accidents or something like that. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3535.34s)]
*  Potentially, indirectly, they could harm us that they cannot be caught. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3539.82s)]
*  We suspect that. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3544.1400000000003s)]
*  And I don't go out alone anywhere because I'm more vocal. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3545.1400000000003s)]
*  So I don't go out alone. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3548.5400000000004s)]
*  For walk or anywhere, I always take my husband along. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3549.7400000000002s)]
*  And we make sure if we go somewhere, we inform our friends where we are. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3552.5s)]
*  We just keep letting people know. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3557.82s)]
*  In fact, I don't want my family from India to visit me because it's a big risk for them. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3559.94s)]
*  Has the New York Times called you to do this story? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3567.06s)]
*  We called New York Times two days after we got his body. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3569.5s)]
*  And we told, I think his name was, I don't remember his name. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3573.7000000000003s)]
*  So we told him many times. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3578.06s)]
*  They haven't even interviewed. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3580.34s)]
*  They ignored it completely. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3582.7000000000003s)]
*  And he said he'll get back. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3585.14s)]
*  He will say, he'll let us know what he can do. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3586.7400000000002s)]
*  And he doesn't even take our call. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3589.9s)]
*  What about the television networks? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3596.1000000000004s)]
*  CNN, NBC, Fox? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3598.38s)]
*  Has anyone? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3600.26s)]
*  Nobody. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3601.26s)]
*  ABC just relayed the candlelight vigil that we had for Sushiran Milpitas. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3602.26s)]
*  One point five minutes they relayed of the vigil information, ABC News. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3607.7000000000003s)]
*  Local? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3612.5s)]
*  Now that we just received this evidence today morning, we probably might reach out to some [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3614.5s)]
*  of the news media. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3620.34s)]
*  Now that we have this evidence, news media will talk to us. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3621.82s)]
*  We want to take it much forward. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3624.98s)]
*  Yeah, for the third time, I just want to say this again. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3626.66s)]
*  I don't think anybody, any honest person could look at this and say, oh yeah, that's a suicide. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3628.94s)]
*  I mean, I just, you know. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3633.78s)]
*  We were hesitant because like they can try to manipulate the evidence or something like [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3635.38s)]
*  that. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3640.02s)]
*  They can even attack the apartment, remove everything, clean up, you know, like some [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3641.02s)]
*  things, crazy things like they might cause a fire and then let the water sprinklers go [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3646.22s)]
*  on and it will destroy the evidence or something. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3651.2599999999998s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3654.34s)]
*  That's why we were very quiet. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3655.34s)]
*  We didn't go to media until we got this authoritative report. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3656.34s)]
*  It's very scary. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3662.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, I'm grateful that you're making, you know, as much noise about this as you are [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3664.9s)]
*  and you're as aggressive as you are. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3671.46s)]
*  Thank you for doing that. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3673.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'm going to... [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3674.98s)]
*  Whistleblowers' lives matter. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3675.98s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3676.98s)]
*  We cannot lose. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3677.98s)]
*  Honestly, I was talking to my son. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3678.98s)]
*  I expressed concerns about his whistleblower activity, but what I was thinking was he won't [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3681.5s)]
*  get another job because he's going against employer. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3686.3s)]
*  He kept assuring me he has his own startup plans. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3689.94s)]
*  But taking his life is something that I never expected. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3693.6200000000003s)]
*  This is not the first time. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3696.6200000000003s)]
*  Two whistleblowers from Boeing were found dead last year. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3698.5400000000004s)]
*  One of them exactly same way. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3702.3s)]
*  Another one died in the hospital. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3706.34s)]
*  They drugged him. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3707.5800000000004s)]
*  This is America. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3712.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3713.46s)]
*  Thank you for this. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3714.46s)]
*  We need to protect them. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3718.5800000000004s)]
*  Most whistleblowers, we were talking to the whistleblower attorneys. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3720.34s)]
*  Most of them, they don't even know there is support. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3723.6600000000003s)]
*  There's not enough awareness. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3726.98s)]
*  Going forward, we want to create awareness and help others. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3729.1800000000003s)]
*  Not just that, there should be some kind of regulation, protection. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3733.5s)]
*  And I'm sure we're going to talk to New York Times at some point of time and said, how [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3737.2200000000003s)]
*  did you put his life at risk? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3741.7000000000003s)]
*  If he was a custodian witness, why didn't you give him protection? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3743.26s)]
*  Why was he left alone? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3746.1800000000003s)]
*  Right? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3748.38s)]
*  What kind of protection did he have for speaking truth? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3749.46s)]
*  Costing his life? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3752.42s)]
*  Well, I think most Americans like you would not even consider the possibility you'd be [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3753.42s)]
*  murdered over something like this. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3758.06s)]
*  The penalty you would assume would be having trouble getting another job, but getting killed [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3760.2200000000003s)]
*  in your apartment. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3764.7000000000003s)]
*  And your son, I know I've asked you, so I want to make totally clear. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3767.42s)]
*  He never mentioned being followed or feeling threatened or anything like that. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3769.5s)]
*  Actually, I do have some observation. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3773.54s)]
*  After New York Times article came, he didn't want us to visit. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3777.8599999999997s)]
*  He would come home and avoid me going there. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3781.54s)]
*  And he would also come during the weekday, not the weekend. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3785.8599999999997s)]
*  I want to investigate why. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3788.9s)]
*  Was he already under some kind of someone was following him or something? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3791.8599999999997s)]
*  I was about to demand him an answer, but he's no more. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3796.1s)]
*  Like slowly, you know, like with an adult, how much can we push him each time we visit? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3799.7799999999997s)]
*  I just made sure like he's eating well and he's healthy and he has strong plans, he has [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3805.34s)]
*  hobbies, all of those things. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3810.26s)]
*  But this kind of information, why are you coming in the weekdays? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3812.1s)]
*  I didn't get a chance to push him. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3816.22s)]
*  He was going to come for Thanksgiving and that's when I would question him, I thought. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3818.26s)]
*  He wasn't even alive till then. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3823.34s)]
*  We didn't have enough time. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3825.46s)]
*  Thank you for telling us this story. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3829.86s)]
*  Thank you for hosting us. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3832.38s)]
*  We want Americans to know what happened and why has the been covered by news media? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3833.78s)]
*  Why no one is talking about it? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3839.1s)]
*  Why they want to repeat like parrots what medical examiner is saying? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3840.7400000000002s)]
*  Why they don't want to stand up for truth? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3844.96s)]
*  Why are we so sold out for these tech lobbying? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3847.94s)]
*  Is there any regulation on the amount of money they can spend for lobbying? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3852.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3856.1s)]
*  It's indirect bribe, right? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3857.1s)]
*  So they're all sold out. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3858.6600000000003s)]
*  Can't we do anything? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3860.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm an American citizen too. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3862.74s)]
*  This is totally disappointing. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3866.62s)]
*  A reporter came home, he took the pictures, he wrote the article and when I mentioned [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3868.22s)]
*  OpenAI's name, there was so much fear in him. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3874.7799999999997s)]
*  He was scared. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3878.3599999999997s)]
*  So the tech companies, they're controlling and they're turning out to be mafia, controlling [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3879.3599999999997s)]
*  the government, controlling the news media. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3883.8799999999997s)]
*  What more harm do we want from them? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3886.24s)]
*  Do we, public, do we need to live in safety or do we need to live in fear? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3889.46s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3894.38s)]
*  Why are we quiet now? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3896.0s)]
*  Now that an innocent life is gone, we're seeing so much going on. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3897.18s)]
*  Why are we quiet? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3900.38s)]
*  Why can't we start justice for such a moment? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3902.62s)]
*  Why can't we do rallies? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3904.82s)]
*  Why can't we go on a non-stoppable movement until we get the justice, until we get the [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3906.32s)]
*  punishment? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3911.38s)]
*  I'm calling out to all Americans to stand with me. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3913.18s)]
*  We want to do rallies all over America. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3916.14s)]
*  We want to do vigil all over America. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3918.46s)]
*  And we want to enforce FBI investigation and punish the culprit. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3921.18s)]
*  I hope this helps. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3925.14s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3933.98s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3937.2200000000003s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3938.88s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right now. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3939.88s)]
*  All the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, when the cusp [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3943.3s)]
*  of fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information rather than [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3948.12s)]
*  more. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3953.2s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3954.2s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3956.2799999999997s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3957.64s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3958.92s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3960.56s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3961.56s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3962.56s)]
*  true, not intentionally deceptive. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3966.3s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3969.04s)]
*  Subscribe. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3972.92s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3973.92s)]
*  That way, you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3978.04s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&t=3983.12s)]
