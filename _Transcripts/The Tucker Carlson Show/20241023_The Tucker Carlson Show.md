# Trump's First Campaign Manager Paul Manafort Breaks Down the Current State of the Presidential Race
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0)
*  So who's get you've been in politics what Ford campaign 76 is that when he started started? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=0.0s)]
*  Who's gonna win this race? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5.28s)]
*  Donald Trump [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=8.16s)]
*  That you sound pretty authoritative on that. I think it's his to lose at this point dark. Yes [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=9.64s)]
*  You [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=30.16s)]
*  Why do you say that well you look at the composition of the undecided voter and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=35.88s)]
*  In seven battleground states the undecided voter [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=41.64s)]
*  Overwhelmingly thinks the country has been going in the wrong direction. They feel like they have not benefited in the last four years [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=46.0s)]
*  They remember because Trump was president just four years ago [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=52.84s)]
*  What it was like when he was president pre-covid and so they can compare his record versus [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=56.96s)]
*  Biden Harris record and you look at the undecided [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=62.96s)]
*  issue agenda [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=66.8s)]
*  It's it's the Trump issue agenda. The number one issue is the economy inflation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=68.48s)]
*  number two is the border and illegal immigration and crime and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=74.4s)]
*  Third issue is safety in the world and somewhere there's abortion somewhere [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=80.84s)]
*  is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  Is fear for democracy, but when you look at how the voters feel on the issue of democracy it splits [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  50-50 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean if the country is fearful because of what Biden has been doing and the other half is fearful because of what Biden says Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=94.84s)]
*  Will do except Trump has been president [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=102.2s)]
*  So you can't say Trump will do something beyond what he did as president before it's it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=105.04s)]
*  The issue doesn't cut with the remaining undecideds what cuts is the economy the border the wars in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=110.82s)]
*  Ukraine and in the Gulf and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=117.38s)]
*  There he has a 10 to 12 point lead and those major issues over Harris among the undecideds [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=120.05999999999999s)]
*  So it's kind of that simple. I mean you so their issues [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  Harris's issues are [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  Trump's personality [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=133.29999999999998s)]
*  Abortion in January 6th Trump's issues are the economy the border crime and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=135.9s)]
*  The threat of nuclear war it seems like he's got a much stronger hand than she does [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=143.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if she had run a different campaign it might have been more difficult for Trump, but she basically gave Trump [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=148.78s)]
*  His issues just to be the deciding issues of the campaign. She's realized that I think you've seen now when she talks about [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  She's the closing narrative of her campaign is Trump is unhinged. She's unstable [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=165.5s)]
*  and and she's using [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  former Republicans as [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  Advocates to make the point she's doing that because the undecided votes is left out [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=177.10000000000002s)]
*  There isn't vote that is inclined towards her for the reasons [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  I just said and so she's got a peel-off soft vote from Trump or people who would not be for who would not be for her [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=186.46s)]
*  But don't like Trump and so they're not gonna vote and so she's trying to get that sort of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=195.3s)]
*  I guess the old the Rhino Republican than the anti Trumpers the suburban women [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  Republican women [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  And so she's her job is to get [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  Those type of people to come out to vote for her [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=213.74s)]
*  but the people who are undecided and are gonna vote in the election are the ones that have the profile that I've described and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=216.46s)]
*  And so as long as Trump stays on message, you know, they're gonna break into my judgment in favor [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=224.02s)]
*  It's you know, because I've been around a long time [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  1980 I was involved in 1980 Reagan campaign at a senior level and in that campaign [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=235.66s)]
*  It was there a lot of parallels to this race. You had a failed and Democrat president in Jimmy Carter [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=241.18s)]
*  The issues were economic and the issues were the Iran hostage situation [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  And [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=253.5s)]
*  and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=254.9s)]
*  But Reagan was an unknown commodity. He'd been governor [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=256.1s)]
*  California, but he the the current campaign against him was he was a cowboy. He was reckless. He would there be World War Three and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=259.74s)]
*  But the issue agenda was an economic issue agenda and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=268.66s)]
*  Like with Trump and this year [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=272.9s)]
*  It's a Reagan had to prove himself as being capably of president Trump doesn't have to do that because he's already been president [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  So that first hurdle that Reagan had [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=282.1s)]
*  Trump doesn't have [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=285.02000000000004s)]
*  Although Harris is trying to make that into a negative hurdle for Trump [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=287.1s)]
*  But once Reagan was able to demonstrate he was he could be president which he did in the only debate that he had with Carter [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=292.86s)]
*  The undecided vote just all moved over to Trump in the last ten days of the campaign to toward Reagan [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=301.1s)]
*  I mean to Reagan the last ten days of the campaign because they saw Reagan as a strong leader and they they were voting against Carter's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=307.54s)]
*  economic record [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=315.22s)]
*  You've got that same kind of dynamic in this race right now. So 45 years later [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=317.54s)]
*  I think very few people remember that the Carter [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=322.7s)]
*  Reagan race in the fall of 1980 was considered too close to call or maybe Carter's to lose [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=326.42s)]
*  Correct. That is correct, right? That is correct. And it was a [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=333.34s)]
*  It was a landslide victory. It certainly was [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=337.54s)]
*  I mean changed American politics for the next 30 years at least right so you were in it [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=340.46s)]
*  Was it obvious to you that Reagan was gonna win? We knew the last week of the campaign. He was going to win [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=347.5s)]
*  data was all [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=354.22s)]
*  very [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=356.02s)]
*  Very clear and we didn't know the landslide would be as big as it was but we knew it was going to be a big win [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=357.02s)]
*  We we actually started spending time covertly [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=363.5s)]
*  And some of the Senate races because we were looking to we and we won a number of Senate seats that were weren't supposed to win [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=366.82s)]
*  In 1980 because the tide was that strong? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=373.1s)]
*  But the but what had happened in 1980 is all the polling companies national poll shut down [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=377.1s)]
*  the last week of the campaign because it showed Carter winning and they all thought he was going to win and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=383.74s)]
*  And [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=390.78s)]
*  It so there was no polling the last week of the campaign except for us we were we were we were doing our [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=391.98s)]
*  Targeted states the internal polling from the right from the campaign and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=400.14s)]
*  And so we saw the break we saw what was happening and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=405.14s)]
*  And so we weren't surprised on election day [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=409.42s)]
*  Every [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=413.26s)]
*  Legacy media account I read of the state of the race today [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=414.94s)]
*  Tells me that it's just too close to call [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=418.85999999999996s)]
*  Is that you don't you don't seem to think that it's too close to call? Why are they saying that? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=421.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think it's you know, I think it's a close election. I think that the undecideds when they break are gonna break [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  three to two two to one for for Trump [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=433.41999999999996s)]
*  He's ahead now in all seven battleground states and in fact, you know, I draw your attention to start watching Virginia [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=437.09999999999997s)]
*  Minnesota and maybe even New Mexico where the races have gotten [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  Close, you know close meaning a couple points [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=449.06s)]
*  And the movement is against Harris in those states. Now, do I think they'll close for Harris? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=452.42s)]
*  Probably but it could we could see happening in those states [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=457.98s)]
*  What we do see happening in the seven battleground states and then decided the differences of the battleground states [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=462.3s)]
*  We're already ahead in every one of them. And so any breaking [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=468.1s)]
*  The [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=472.06s)]
*  Disproportionately to Trump will enhance the lead as opposed to Virginia or Minnesota where we need to take the lead from the breaking [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=473.29999999999995s)]
*  But it's possible. I mean in the clues you see [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=481.7s)]
*  It is when you look at what's happened this past weekend and some of the key Democrats Senate incumbent races in the Blue Wall States [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=486.74s)]
*  in [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=495.58s)]
*  Wisconsin and in Michigan and Pennsylvania you have incumbent Democrat senators running [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=496.82s)]
*  who are in dead heat races with Republican challengers and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=502.78s)]
*  by public polling and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=509.1s)]
*  You look they've all put up ads this weekend all three races [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=512.3s)]
*  where the Democrat [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=516.7s)]
*  Senators are endorsing Trump policies by name in their political advertising using the word Donald Trump using the word touted [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=519.26s)]
*  They support the Trump border plan. They support the Trump fracking plan. They support the Trump tariff plan [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=526.34s)]
*  depending on the states [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=532.7s)]
*  They would be a Democrat supporting the Trump border plan. Yeah [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=535.7s)]
*  Well, that's like a violation of the catechism. That's a big deal to say something like that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=540.5400000000001s)]
*  I think it and the Trump tariff plan in in Michigan [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=544.4200000000001s)]
*  It's not something that Harris is supporting at all and yet Slotkin is and they're in her advertising [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=549.6600000000001s)]
*  When you see that kind of evidence, you know, they're seen in their private polling [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=555.94s)]
*  What we're seeing in our private polling, which is that the undecideds that are left in the race? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=559.94s)]
*  Probably in theirs and ours since there's their tracking [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=567.58s)]
*  Are on the same issue agenda and they wouldn't be meaning on economics Trump's position on [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=571.62s)]
*  tariffs in Michigan Trump's position on fracking in Pennsylvania [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=578.34s)]
*  and [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=582.5s)]
*  it's so [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=583.6600000000001s)]
*  You see it empirically in there you see in our data [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=585.18s)]
*  We we feel like watching the shift in the in the narrative that Harris has taken [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=588.02s)]
*  past week [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=595.38s)]
*  Since her Fox interview where she now is totally on this personality cult attack and that he's too dangerous to be president [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=596.8199999999999s)]
*  Giving up all the issues. She's giving up the issue agenda [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=605.3s)]
*  And inch making her race all about why would she do that? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=608.7399999999999s)]
*  Because I think she believes [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=612.8199999999999s)]
*  She sees what we see which is that on the the main issues [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=614.9399999999999s)]
*  She has not sold her case and Trump has they view Trump as better on [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=619.9s)]
*  Dealing with inflation by 12 points and in some of the public polls [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=625.78s)]
*  They see Trump on the border by over 12 points over 15 points over her [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=629.9s)]
*  Yeah, and trusting him to deal with overseas issues by 10 points. She sees that so, you know [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=635.74s)]
*  It's too late in the campaign now to change that that direction. So she's got to [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=641.86s)]
*  Throw the Hail Mary Paris, which was the other core part of her strategy [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=649.14s)]
*  Which is Trump is unhinged and unstable and she's focusing on this soft [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=653.74s)]
*  vote and Republican vote or the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=659.62s)]
*  Republican vote that's not voting which is suburban women [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=662.66s)]
*  And in targeting them on the message and using Liz Cheney and others [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=666.38s)]
*  so if you're [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=672.26s)]
*  If you're pulling out the Cheney's as a Democratic presidential candidate in the last [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=673.9s)]
*  moments, I mean first of all, you know, you deserve to lose more than anything for doing that but but [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=679.86s)]
*  If someone had told you five years ago that the most left-wing [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=685.5s)]
*  American senator would become the Democratic presidential candidate and trot the Cheney's out [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=689.9s)]
*  What I mean, I mean you can't make that stuff. Yeah [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=695.9s)]
*  No, and and the thing is [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=700.0999999999999s)]
*  Both parties have got their base [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=703.26s)]
*  I mean when Trump's getting in all the public polls not between 90 and 93 percent of the Republican vote [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=706.56s)]
*  She's getting between 90 and 92 percent of the Democratic vote. So this is not a base election anymore the base [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=713.06s)]
*  You know [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=720.66s)]
*  But what she's trying to do is mix up the base a little bit by some of these [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=721.26s)]
*  Anti-Trump Republicans who are not voting prayer for the most part of her I had [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=727.2199999999999s)]
*  In trying to peel those votes over to her because she's not confident she could win over the undecided voter in Western, Pennsylvania [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=733.3s)]
*  Because of where the Trump's position over her is on the economy I'm fracking [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=742.98s)]
*  and this is this is where she failed in her debate with Trump and [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=748.8199999999999s)]
*  Her job at that debate was to introduce herself to the country but to also show that she had a plan [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=754.02s)]
*  She didn't do that and by going dark with the with the media for so long. She never defined herself [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=759.74s)]
*  And in what the Trump campaign has done [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=767.42s)]
*  Using her and her public appearances that are recorded statements from 2019 as well as the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=770.5s)]
*  While vice president we've defined her using her on her positions [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=777.74s)]
*  And that's worked and in as a result you have [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=783.02s)]
*  You know a lot of them he's carrying the independent vote he's we could carry the Hispanic vote [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=789.14s)]
*  Like majority like majority in a couple of the battleground states. Yes, like a majority. He's getting 25% of the so that's a history changing [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=795.98s)]
*  Change in politics if that happens. Yeah, and and you know, it's for a lot of reasons, but all of them make sense [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=805.46s)]
*  Independent in Nevada in Arizona [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=813.26s)]
*  It's because of the border. It's because of the crime. It's because of the impact of illegals on their communities [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=816.38s)]
*  But it's also cultural values and woke ism, you know and family values [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=823.06s)]
*  It's it's school board issues and transgender and things like that [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=828.5799999999999s)]
*  We're in the Hispanic families. It's a culturally tight-knit family situation. These are issues that bother them [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=833.62s)]
*  I think Nevada's majority Hispanic now or pretty close or yeah close for sure [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=841.1s)]
*  And so the idea was that people with Hispanic last names love illegal immigration [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=846.5s)]
*  But that's turned out it's not true at all. No because they're paying this they're suffering the most [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=852.98s)]
*  and one [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=859.98s)]
*  Because they're of their jobs too because the impact on limited community resources [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=861.66s)]
*  three the crimes in their neighborhoods and [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=867.0600000000001s)]
*  And and you've had Harris out there for three and a half years saying there's no problem [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=870.26s)]
*  There is no border problem. They're not recognizing it not even visiting it and being empathetic [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=876.34s)]
*  And that has resonated in the Hispanic community [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=882.1s)]
*  and we're seeing that in the Hispanic community and people places like Pennsylvania as well and [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=887.22s)]
*  It's so [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=893.1s)]
*  That that framework [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=895.78s)]
*  The electorate is totally tilting away is in some of the Hispanic vote and a lot of the black vote [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=898.3000000000001s)]
*  That's the favoring Trump is it it has to it's a two-fer for us because it's one vote out of the Democratic candidate [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=905.3000000000001s)]
*  One vote for the Republican [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=912.46s)]
*  It's not just a swing voter. That's you know for grabs [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=915.1s)]
*  She's losing a vote every time we gain a black vote [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=919.82s)]
*  You know that she normally would have had as a Democrat nominee and [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=923.5s)]
*  again the the reason these people the [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=927.3399999999999s)]
*  Profile of the Trump black voter this time are black men under 25. I mean under 435 [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=931.18s)]
*  And it's for a reason they've suffered economically. They've given up on the the promises of the Democratic Party [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=938.14s)]
*  they're there and and [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=945.5s)]
*  Trump in some ways is a [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=947.98s)]
*  Iconic figure to them and and but he definitely gets them they and they see that he gets them [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=950.8599999999999s)]
*  so [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=958.3399999999999s)]
*  It's that that vote is not vote. That's gonna slip away in the next two weeks as we get close [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=960.06s)]
*  close to the election [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=967.5799999999999s)]
*  And that's why she's targeting [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=969.78s)]
*  Disaffected women Republicans who don't like Trump the personality [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=972.6999999999999s)]
*  It's just kind of weird that she'd be running on Trump's personality because it's the single most familiar fact in all American politics [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=976.62s)]
*  What Donald Trump's personality is like because we've talked about it every single day for 10 years. So [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=983.3399999999999s)]
*  Is there really room for movement on that question? Is there anyone thinking? Oh, wow, trump is kind of volatile [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=989.18s)]
*  I had no idea. I think I won't vote for him. She's already got those orders exactly [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=995.26s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=999.26s)]
*  I mean it's baked in and that's why [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=999.5s)]
*  The these undecided voters if you look at any focus groups that are out there [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1002.38s)]
*  You'll see they all are saying. Yeah, I don't like his personality [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1007.02s)]
*  But I was better for the day under his when he was president [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1010.78s)]
*  And I don't know what she stands for and I don't want to risk for more years [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1014.46s)]
*  And these are people who traditionally vote democrat because they told us remember they would always [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1019.34s)]
*  Remember, I mean it's all they talked about for [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1024.6200000000001s)]
*  The better part of a decade trump is a racist trump is a racist [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1027.1799999999998s)]
*  Let me repeat trump is a racist and now just like on track to win [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1029.8999999999999s)]
*  The majority of the hispanic vote in a huge chunk of black men. I guess that didn't work we can say [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1033.9799999999998s)]
*  No, it didn't. I mean it's [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1040.3s)]
*  That could have worked if it was part of a strategy but not the work because it's the strategy [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1044.3s)]
*  and [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1050.3799999999999s)]
*  That's all that she's offering [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1051.6599999999999s)]
*  People who have had a very lousy three and a half years do they even say that anymore trump is a race member [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1053.98s)]
*  That was the only thing they said they're not saying it that way anymore [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1058.94s)]
*  Although I think you will see in the next two weeks [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1062.0600000000002s)]
*  They will get that raw again because that's the stage that they're at in the campaign [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1064.46s)]
*  So I think it's going to be a very ugly close [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1070.22s)]
*  By by the harris campaign in what way I mean they will be tossing around hitler and racism and things like that [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1073.02s)]
*  as if they were not [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1079.8200000000002s)]

*  Said something like that called him hitler said he was a white supremacist or racist. I remember being really shocked by it now [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1208.94s)]
*  It's like oh shut up. Well, it's people are more immune to it again in my personal opinion [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1214.78s)]
*  She's got the vote that's going to be moved by that [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1220.3s)]
*  right [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1223.02s)]
*  There that's not going to be the last five percent [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1224.3799999999999s)]
*  and uh [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1227.58s)]
*  Yeah, and [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1229.34s)]
*  So trump is running a closing campaign that's dealing with what what the undecideds want to hear [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1231.5s)]
*  um [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1238.86s)]
*  She is running a closing campaign that's based on fear [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1240.22s)]
*  Trying to write it trying to make the undecided voter fear trump and therefore just resign [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1243.8999999999999s)]
*  Will they say okay? I'm willing to risk four more years of this because I fear trump, right? I don't think that's a winning close [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1249.1799999999998s)]
*  and uh [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1255.98s)]
*  And I don't see it in the data and I don't see it in my experience in politics [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1257.34s)]
*  Of being the kind of thing in a close race if you will [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1263.02s)]
*  That will be [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1268.3s)]
*  Allow people to vote against their economic interest [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1269.98s)]
*  Because that's what they're these undecided people are saying is i've had a miserable four years [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1273.98s)]
*  Yeah, I believe trump can do a better job for me, but i'm going to vote against him [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1279.5s)]
*  I don't see that happening. Do you feel confident enough to bet on it? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1284.62s)]
*  Uh, if I were a betting man, yes [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1288.86s)]
*  Do you believe in the predictions markets the betting markets well, I mean I pay attention to them and uh [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1293.5s)]
*  And if you look at the betting markets today, they're at the highest point [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1300.7s)]
*  In the in the all years trump has been in politics [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1306.6200000000001s)]
*  Saying that trump's going to win [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1310.3s)]
*  it's like uh the the average I think today is like 58 59 percent of the [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1311.98s)]
*  Betting market is saying trump [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1319.1000000000001s)]
*  Now and and you can track how that betting market has gone [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1321.42s)]
*  Since she came into the race when she had the first announced when we went through the sugar high and then the [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1326.46s)]
*  The debate I mean the the the betting markets followed her and then were favoring her [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1332.54s)]
*  But over the last month as the campaign [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1338.94s)]
*  Yeah, the campaign strategies have impacted the electorate at the grassroots level [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1342.46s)]
*  You've started to see it ticking up for trump and now it's dramatically up for trump [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1348.22s)]
*  Um going into the close the last two weeks of the close and I don't see any major october surprise as we call it [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1352.86s)]
*  That's going to come up [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1360.46s)]
*  Uh that can change that trajectory now [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1362.1399999999999s)]
*  Uh, the hurricane season is almost over. Yeah [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1364.94s)]
*  Uh the the war situation I think is [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1368.3s)]
*  The war they're waiting it out for the next two weeks to see who wins. I could be wrong [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1372.54s)]
*  But I mean if israel does something in striking in iran [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1377.18s)]
*  I that doesn't hurt trump. It could hurt harris [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1381.4199999999998s)]
*  The economy's not going to get better in the next two weeks [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1385.26s)]
*  So there's no event [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1388.4599999999998s)]
*  That's going to change [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1390.9399999999998s)]
*  The trajectory of the race like the debate did in 1980 reagan versus carter allowing the undecideds to vote their economic interest [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1393.1799999999998s)]
*  There's nothing that's going to change. I don't believe that will allow the undecideds vote against their economic interests for air airs [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1400.62s)]
*  Um, that's been and and again [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1408.22s)]
*  Trump is ahead in all seven states right now by the by the public polling [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1411.5800000000002s)]
*  uh, uh summaries so [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1417.26s)]
*  The the foundation is there and you also have what we call the the unknown trump factor [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1420.94s)]
*  Where historically trump is one or two points better than the polls show him to be [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1427.66s)]
*  Uh, and in some cases dramatically more than one or two points, uh, you look at [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1433.8200000000002s)]
*  The national polls today harris is up by about a point and a half nationally and national polls of of all voters [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1439.9s)]
*  It's very it's not a good measure any longer of what's going to happen into an election day [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1448.46s)]
*  plus [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1454.22s)]
*  You have [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1455.66s)]
*  People voting now [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1457.02s)]
*  So it's not just voting on election day [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1458.54s)]
*  the [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1463.02s)]
*  Changes that we're all seeing happen in trump's favor [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1463.98s)]
*  It's happening contemporaneously people actually casting votes [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1467.58s)]
*  Uh, and you know one of the you know, the harris campaign has had the money advantage [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1471.1s)]
*  um [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1476.54s)]
*  But they've also been big money big money advantage [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1477.5s)]
*  But you know, but too much money advantage meaning that we don't need as much money as she has to win [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1480.54s)]
*  We were hillary clinton overspent outspent trump, but by almost half a billion dollars in 2016 and lost [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1486.7s)]
*  um [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1494.14s)]
*  Yeah, and so she's gonna [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1495.5800000000002s)]
*  Not be much more than if she won't be that much ahead of trump in the end [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1498.5400000000002s)]
*  um and uh [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1502.5400000000002s)]
*  But her money advantage and her quote field advantage, you know was supposed to make the difference [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1504.7s)]
*  Well, she doesn't have a field advantage [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1510.46s)]
*  And that's one of the myths that the mainstream media has perpetuated during this campaign [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1512.3s)]
*  It's that trump has no ground game and harris has this juggernaut [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1515.98s)]
*  Well, the last time I heard that was in 2016 when I was told that the campaign we had put together was was [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1519.5s)]
*  Terrible grassroots campaign and that hillary clinton had the most professional [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1526.86s)]
*  Field operation in history. Well, we know what happened what happened there [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1531.4199999999998s)]
*  It's the same thing. They're saying the same thing today. We have a very good ground [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1535.98s)]
*  I mean when you look at the early voting that's happening and the and millions of votes have been cast by now [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1539.34s)]
*  Between the early voting and absentee voting and you where everyone's modeling that stuff [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1546.54s)]
*  And the democrats turn out advantage on early voting is dramatically less than it's ever been [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1552.22s)]
*  Again over the last eight years [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1559.26s)]
*  But guess and so we're holding our own or doing better than our own [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1562.3s)]
*  In the early voting but then guess who has an advantage on election day [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1566.62s)]
*  We do because that's where we've always had to turn all of our vote out because we always were against early voting until this cycle [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1570.78s)]
*  She doesn't have as good an organization for the election day as she has for early voting [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1577.58s)]
*  But she's not winning the margin she needs so far in the first two weeks of early voting that's happened [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1583.5s)]
*  So the field organization isn't even an advantage at this point in time. We've got the issue advantage [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1588.94s)]
*  And uh, and we've got more than enough money to do what we need to do in our campaign [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1595.18s)]
*  therefore [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1600.76s)]
*  Looking at all the pieces of an election [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1602.38s)]
*  her race is [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1605.02s)]
*  counting on her [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1607.02s)]
*  Getting people to vote against their economic interest because trump is a threat to democracy. I don't see that happening [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1608.94s)]
*  I agree with you. Um [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1616.3s)]
*  Um [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1618.3799999999999s)]
*  Looking back over the last three months really since june since the debate between trump and biden [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1619.58s)]
*  What are the things that the trump campaign has done right do you think? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1627.02s)]
*  Well, they were ready for her harris [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1632.22s)]
*  I mean we saw going into after the debate june the possibility [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1634.54s)]
*  that [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1640.3799999999999s)]
*  Uh biden might not be a candidate. I didn't believe it. I thought he would never quit [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1641.18s)]
*  Um, but but the campaign saw the possibility and so they did their research on harris and on [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1645.98s)]
*  The other potential candidates that could have been the nominee [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1653.58s)]
*  So that when biden did drop out [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1657.66s)]
*  We were ready [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1660.46s)]
*  Uh, and we had ads ready [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1662.1399999999999s)]
*  And uh, and we knew how we wanted to define all of the potential bonus we might have [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1664.62s)]
*  we didn't think that [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1671.02s)]
*  They would uh get rid of biden and give us harris [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1673.66s)]
*  Because we've we viewed harris as the weakest of all the potential candidates because she'd have to live on the record of the administration [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1679.18s)]
*  exactly, um and [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1686.04s)]
*  But that was joe biden's gift to donald trump [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1688.62s)]
*  Uh because biden was so upset with the democratic coup d'etat against him [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1691.74s)]
*  Uh that he told him he was going to endorse his vice president [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1697.82s)]
*  When we had nancy pelosi [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1702.46s)]
*  And obama wanted an open primary of all the leading candidates so they could control who would come out of the democratic convention [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1704.7s)]
*  She didn't they didn't get that biden [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1713.34s)]
*  Announced on sunday. He was quitting announced on monday [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1715.9s)]
*  He endorsed the cabal heirs and then it became impossible for anybody to run against him [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1718.38s)]
*  You think that was an act of aggression against his own party? I do [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1722.94s)]
*  Really? Yeah [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1726.46s)]
*  So diminished though he is you think that joe biden was angry enough at pelosi and obama [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1728.14s)]
*  That he decided to screw the democratic party by gifting them michelle [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1734.7s)]
*  You've watched his irish temper enough times as I have yeah, and you know how he's always felt disparaged by the democratic establishment [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1738.7800000000002s)]
*  Including obama including that nancy pelosi especially obama. Yeah, and [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1747.26s)]
*  When he didn't want to quit he he felt and there's a case to be made today [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1752.62s)]
*  That he could have been a better candidate than heiress [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1757.1s)]
*  Because he felt all along that the democratic base which was against which was the reason why he was trailing badly after his debate [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1759.82s)]
*  Would have no choice but to come together [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1767.26s)]
*  After labor day and support him and then he thought he could beat [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1770.06s)]
*  Beat uh trump again [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1774.22s)]
*  You look at the if you want to analyze it through his [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1776.46s)]
*  his eyes [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1779.98s)]
*  He's probably right that the base would have come back to him. The media would have had to come back to him [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1781.42s)]
*  Uh against trump because there's they were always going to be against trump [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1786.38s)]
*  And he would be a much better candidate in pennsylvania. He'd be a much better candidate [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1791.66s)]
*  Uh in the in the midwest [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1796.54s)]
*  Because he's got working class roots [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1799.18s)]
*  You've got an elitist democrat liberal [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1801.98s)]
*  Uh as the democratic nominee when the battleground states are in the midwest [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1805.18s)]
*  Yeah, and uh, and so you could make the case that he would have been at least as strong as heres [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1811.42s)]
*  Uh, but but the pelosi strategy was never to have heres [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1817.66s)]
*  and uh, it's they they were chapiro [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1821.5800000000002s)]
*  Or a whitmer or even a newsome could have had, you know a certain appeal in the midwest that a heres didn't have [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1824.6200000000001s)]
*  So you think obama and pelosi never thought they were getting kamala heres when they pushed biden to retire. I don't [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1831.3400000000001s)]
*  Really? Yeah, and that was joe biden's gift [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1837.26s)]
*  To them in return for the gift they gave him [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1840.7s)]
*  and so [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1844.62s)]
*  Knifing him. Yes, and so [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1845.82s)]
*  but that's why [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1848.78s)]
*  heres but what we didn't analyze nobody could have is how [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1851.1799999999998s)]
*  All in the media would be to just [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1856.86s)]
*  You know make her into the second obama to try to make her into this except she can't speak like obama [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1860.46s)]
*  She's you know, she was much more articulate obama stood for something that she can't stand for obama was going to be the first black president [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1867.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, now she's going to first black woman president, but they the concept cares at this. Yeah, exactly [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1875.1799999999998s)]
*  And uh, and she's not articulate she [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1881.26s)]
*  She's afraid of being with the media if they don't prop her up. She can't hold her own [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1884.3799999999999s)]
*  and [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1889.02s)]
*  I've learned having done enough elections that the american people [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1890.3799999999999s)]
*  Generally get it [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1894.6999999999998s)]
*  They they by election day they get it. I mean sometimes we go with the you know in 2020 [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1896.3s)]
*  Covid distorted everything and then the changing of the rules on voting distorted everything [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1904.3799999999999s)]
*  And then republicans not knowing how to deal with early voting and participating distorted everything [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1910.22s)]
*  Well, this is a much more normal election. I mean the rules are the same rules are settled rules [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1916.1399999999999s)]
*  We fixed some of the excesses of 2020 in the in the number of the battleground states so that voter identification [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1923.98s)]
*  Is going to be important? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1931.98s)]
*  Republicans are participating in early voting this time in an aggressive way and we're seeing it in the early voting [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1934.04s)]
*  results [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1941.58s)]
*  so [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1942.78s)]
*  In a more normal election having a california liberal who hasn't been out there running for president [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1943.9s)]
*  Uh in trying to define herself [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1950.1399999999999s)]
*  What you know should not be a victorius campaign the reason she's in play is because the media has defined her for her [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1953.6599999999999s)]
*  As the saint and this uh this turning the page. Well again, the american people know turning the page from what? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1961.26s)]
*  From the biden harris administration. How do you turn the page on yourself and give them something different? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1969.1s)]
*  And what especially when she hasn't defined what she's going to do or when she has it's been contradiction to what she said [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1975.34s)]
*  She stood for before [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1982.1399999999999s)]
*  and again [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1983.82s)]
*  She's winning her vote and most polls show this because even in the democratic base that supported her they're anti-trump [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1985.8999999999999s)]
*  Uh, because a lot of those people who weren't so [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1994.6999999999998s)]
*  Anti-trump democrats would be voting for a republican candidate right now [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=1998.6s)]
*  Not name trump because of the economic failures of this administration against theirs [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2004.5400000000002s)]
*  But trump brings out an additional kind of voter that no republican can get [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2010.5400000000002s)]
*  and he's changing the the the [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2015.5800000000002s)]
*  Composition of the republican party into a working man's party working-class party to a middle american party [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2018.3000000000002s)]
*  I think it's finally happening. It must be weird for you [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2023.98s)]
*  Uh someone who's been you know top levels the republican party for all these years almost 50 [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2027.9s)]
*  To see all these people, you know [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2034.14s)]
*  Come out against trump and in some cases for kamala harris like the pillars of the party dick cheney is just one among many [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2036.94s)]
*  It it yes it is and it's and it's because of the personality that's the coming out but it's also because they've [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2044.7s)]
*  They've had their time and they just they're settled in their ways and they think that trump doesn't represent [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2052.14s)]
*  The party that they were a part of uh, you know 20 years ago. He doesn't [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2059.26s)]
*  Well, he doesn't but a lot of the principles he does yes, and so [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2063.5800000000004s)]
*  But they've put they've they've subordinated principles to the the how they want the party to look [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2070.0600000000004s)]
*  which is [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2077.1800000000003s)]
*  The exact opposite of what the democrats have done. They don't care what the party looks like [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2078.78s)]
*  It's principles that drive the democratic party and it's woke leftist principles that are not in the interest of the country [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2083.1800000000003s)]
*  And as a result you've had the changing of the electorate of the of the composition of the two parties [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2089.66s)]
*  Where the democrats are now an elitist party from the coast and the republicans are main street [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2096.14s)]
*  And not wall street even though their reputation is still at and they and trump is making it into a really working class party [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2101.82s)]
*  What do you think of that? Well, I think [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2108.62s)]
*  well, I think if you want to run a country you have to have more than elitist as a as a [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2111.7400000000002s)]
*  Focus of where your policy should go. Yeah, I mean that's why I got involved in politics [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2117.66s)]
*  I mean as a conservative i've i've you know back in the in the 60s. I was upset with what was emerging as [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2122.2999999999997s)]
*  johnson kind of big government the social welfare program, uh, you know things like that and uh, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2130.52s)]
*  And so I was coming from a working class background [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2137.98s)]
*  I saw the republican party not necessarily the leadership of the republican party [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2141.28s)]
*  but the principles of what goldwater was talking about and uh as uh [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2145.6800000000003s)]
*  As something that attracted my interest well trump is taking that to a new level [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2150.0s)]
*  Trump has made it into the leadership of the party not just the focus of the principles of the party [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2154.5600000000004s)]
*  And I think long term [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2159.92s)]
*  That's a coalition that can govern for a long time [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2162.2400000000002s)]
*  uh, especially when you take the [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2166.4s)]
*  The negative part of trump out of the equation and keep all the positives. Yeah in the equation [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2169.36s)]
*  I think that that the democrats are either going to have to come back towards the center [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2175.6s)]
*  Or we are going to be in power for a long time. I mean, I think [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2181.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not inconceivable to think that trump is going to have a republican congress. He's going to have a republican senate [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2185.36s)]
*  Uh, he could have 54 55 members of the republican senate [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2192.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, and it's probable with him winning with breaking the way [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2197.68s)]
*  I think things are going to break that will keep the house [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2201.92s)]
*  And if we do that [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2204.72s)]
*  Then something very different from 2017 is going to exist. You're going to have an experienced president trump [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2206.48s)]
*  Who understands washington a lot better than he did in 2017 when he took the oath of office [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2213.6s)]
*  And you're going to have a republican congress controlled congress. That's [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2218.48s)]
*  People people that are part of the trump make america great again agenda [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2223.04s)]
*  Uh with the speaker of the house who actually is supportive of the economic policies that trump wants to enact [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2228.32s)]
*  Versus what paul ryan was doing, uh as speaker of the house [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2234.56s)]
*  Convincing trump not to do the things that he should have done in the first year and therefore having immigration reform and and and [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2238.16s)]
*  Economic reforms that trump wanted put on the back burner to never get to the front burner [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2245.66s)]
*  That's not going to happen in 2020 [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2250.8s)]
*  and [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2253.6s)]
*  So with those changes [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2254.64s)]
*  I believe the country is going to get stronger economically. I think the world is going to get better get it safer [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2256.7200000000003s)]
*  I think we're going to have borders again, and that is going to lock in a lot of this new support [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2261.84s)]
*  That is voting for trump because they think he will be better for them [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2267.52s)]
*  But then they're going to see that the party as a whole that trump has put together can also be better for them after trump [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2273.12s)]
*  um and with somebody like jd vance [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2279.8399999999997s)]
*  Even people like marco rubio now [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2283.2s)]
*  Out there talking about the the trump record the trump policies [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2286.16s)]
*  It's going to make a big difference and I think hispanics will be attracted to that [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2290.72s)]
*  I think working-class americans will be attracted to that [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2295.2s)]
*  And with trump having a government of people for him as opposed to a government of people [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2298.16s)]
*  That were not for him, but then wanted to be part of the government that he created and then undercut him as president [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2304.16s)]
*  time and time again [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2310.96s)]
*  That's going to be different this year the people are going to be put in power [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2312.64s)]
*  That will implement the trump agenda and be supportive of the trump agenda and that's why to all of these former [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2315.9199999999996s)]
*  republican [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2322.46s)]
*  Trump administration people who are now supporting harris. They didn't support trump in 2016 [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2324.3199999999997s)]
*  They became part of his government after he won, but they were not supporting him in 2016 [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2330.82s)]
*  Um, they did not buy into the trump policies that trump was elected on and so when they didn't follow his direction he fired him [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2335.94s)]
*  The difference is harris's people and her staff is vice president [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2345.22s)]
*  You know 95 of the people who worked for her [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2349.86s)]
*  Quit on her they didn't get fired. They quit on her. They couldn't take her because she was such a terrible boss [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2353.06s)]
*  That's the difference. That's what you can expect under harris. She can't manage people [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2358.9s)]
*  trump [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2363.86s)]
*  Had the wrong people in office because he didn't have a team in 2017 [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2365.14s)]
*  Because he was an outsider coming into washington, but he's got a team now [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2369.86s)]
*  And it's a team that believes in what he wants to do and what he's campaigning on [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2373.46s)]
*  And so what he gets elected on unlike what biden and harris did in 2020 and then did as in as as [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2377.46s)]
*  As president vice president trump is going to implement the policies he's been out there talking about [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2384.34s)]
*  And he's going to bring people in who are committed to those policies different than 2017 [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2389.3s)]
*  And I think we have a chance to have a very good two years with that a lot of these changes can start to take root [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2393.94s)]
*  What a disaster if trump does win it'll be for the democratic party [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2401.62s)]
*  the second he won in 2016 [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2406.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, the first thing that was resolved to put you know, the people who got him there including you in prison and they succeeded [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2409.86s)]
*  Um mike flan they tried to put him in prison. I mean roger stone [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2416.26s)]
*  I mean they really went and just tried to imprison the opposition and then they tried to imprison trump [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2419.78s)]
*  And I think pretty clearly stole the 2020 election. That's my view. Um, they eliminated free speech. That's theft enough [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2426.5s)]
*  And it didn't work and then he wins in 2024 after all of that what is it like [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2433.46s)]
*  If that happens in the democratic party [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2440.58s)]
*  I think the left takes over [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2444.2599999999998s)]
*  Interesting yeah, I think [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2447.2999999999997s)]
*  Who's gonna get gutted here is the centrist in the democratic party [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2451.8599999999997s)]
*  um, really absolutely absolutely, I think that uh, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2456.58s)]
*  The washington part of the party will be done dramatically controlled by the sanders wing [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2460.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think sanders, you know the unspoken story here [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2468.1800000000003s)]
*  Is the the guy with the network in the states in the democratic party is bernie sanfors, of course [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2471.86s)]
*  Yes, and they the what you saw [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2477.6200000000003s)]
*  Happened with ronald reagan in 1977 after he lost the nomination to jerry ford and ford lost the presidency to jimmy carter [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2480.82s)]
*  reagan's network of people spent three years [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2490.1s)]
*  Building in the states the reagan organization that elected him president [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2494.2599999999998s)]
*  Because reagan had foreseen the future issue wise [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2500.58s)]
*  Uh the i think the sanders people are going to do the same thing [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2505.2999999999997s)]
*  In the if there's a debacle in 19 in 2024 [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2509.2999999999997s)]
*  But they're going to be misreading the future in my judgment on the issues unlike what reagan did [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2513.62s)]
*  Uh, and so they as they take control they're going to push the party further and further left to the populist left the economic left [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2519.14s)]
*  What do you mean by the well? I think [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2526.42s)]
*  I think [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2528.66s)]
*  both the populist left [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2529.86s)]
*  And the economic left I think [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2532.42s)]
*  They're going to be driven by the economic left [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2534.98s)]
*  But the populist left is going to be the way they they sell their message. So but like the tranny left the [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2538.2599999999998s)]
*  you know [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2544.98s)]
*  The weird kind of [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2546.98s)]
*  Rich lady left those the emphasis on the sexual issues on racial division [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2549.06s)]
*  Does that I mean that doesn't seem to have worked [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2554.82s)]
*  That's what I call the populist left [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2558.7400000000002s)]
*  Um, I think the economic left is where they will frame it because it's more [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2560.82s)]
*  Acceptable to the dis the disadvantaged. Uh, uh, yeah, and you can make that case to the [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2566.0s)]
*  Illegal migrants who may be ending up getting entrenched here in one way or another [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2574.2599999999998s)]
*  But the left takes so the lesson if they lose to the democrats will be we didn't go left enough [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2581.86s)]
*  Well, I don't know that that's the lesson that they would to them [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2589.22s)]
*  But that's the opportunity to the left within the party, which is the dominant part of the party. Yeah [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2592.9s)]
*  Interesting there's a lot of chaos out there in the world and that's why your bed is your sanctuary a place of peace [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2598.98s)]

*  Look, look who's on the horizon. You've got bernie sanders still got elizabeth warren still you got amy clwitcher still [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2670.8199999999997s)]

*  They've sailed to that ship their ships in that direction. Now, can they change? Yeah, of course they can change [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2683.62s)]
*  But the power base in the grassroots that they have to appeal to to emerge victorius for 2028 [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2692.1s)]
*  Is the left [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2699.94s)]
*  and [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2701.54s)]
*  They are much more [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2702.9s)]
*  Hardcore than republicans are at punishing [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2705.86s)]
*  Uh if if they're their opposition [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2710.1800000000003s)]
*  so [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2713.54s)]
*  I will I don't think there's any leadership in washington [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2714.6600000000003s)]
*  With pelosi being gone now [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2719.46s)]
*  uh that that uh, that's brings [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2721.86s)]
*  Sort of moves towards the center. I think obama [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2726.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh, you know will be where a lot of them go to but obama I don't this is his last fight [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2729.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean he he if he loses this I mean if she loses he loses [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2736.1000000000004s)]
*  and [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2741.7000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't want to spend the rest of his life [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2742.7400000000002s)]
*  You know refighting that war he he's a former president. He's made millions of dollars since she's left [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2745.2200000000003s)]
*  Uh, you know, it's up to a new leadership to take the party over [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2750.42s)]
*  And so I don't I don't see him you don't even see michelle obama out there right now [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2754.5s)]
*  Campaigning for harris. I think she will in the last two weeks, but you know, she hasn't been out there this time [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2759.2200000000003s)]
*  Why do you think? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2764.98s)]
*  There's something there. I mean, I don't know what it is, but there's something there [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2767.06s)]
*  um [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2770.9s)]
*  Obama even hasn't been that aggressively out there even though, you know, this was his coup d'etat [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2772.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, she wasn't necessarily his candidate, but this was his coup d'etat. Um [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2778.26s)]
*  and uh [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2784.42s)]
*  But my point is I don't see obama in the future trying to direct the democratic party [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2785.94s)]
*  Pelosi will be gone schumer's not a national politician. He's a you know, he's a washington politician [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2792.42s)]
*  Uh keem jeffries doesn't have any profile of seriousness [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2798.18s)]
*  The national democrats in washington are the leftist the sanders the the uh, the warrants people like that [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2801.3s)]
*  and uh [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2809.06s)]
*  So if trump gets [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2810.5s)]
*  The majority, um in two weeks [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2812.34s)]
*  Will the democrats? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2815.46s)]
*  Including their army of lawyers just kind of give up [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2817.3s)]
*  Oh, just say you you won [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2820.9s)]
*  I think look january 6th is their playbook [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2823.54s)]
*  Right. I mean I I was last time too. Yeah, exactly [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2826.98s)]
*  So do I think that they're just going to accept the results as trump says correctly hillary clinton is still contesting the 2016 election [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2830.1000000000004s)]
*  Uh, they will never give trump the the benefit of winning an election no matter how big he wins it [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2838.66s)]
*  But [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2846.3399999999997s)]
*  He's going to be president in january of 2025 and they're gonna have to deal with that but they'll make it [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2847.2999999999997s)]
*  It'll be a difficult uh [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2852.8199999999997s)]
*  You know transition period there'll be a lot of protest [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2854.9s)]
*  I mean the week after between people running to the their psychiatrist offices and people were you know, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2857.7799999999997s)]
*  You're running to the streets to burn things, you know, it's going to be a mess [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2864.58s)]
*  But can you think of any legal mechanism they could use to prevent trump from being seated as president in january? No [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2869.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean they tried to set some of those things up when they were trying to play with electors for this time around and [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2876.1s)]
*  And rules about the states not having to follow the results of the election [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2881.06s)]
*  but no, there's [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2885.7s)]
*  The system works our system works and uh [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2887.06s)]
*  as far as [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2890.8999999999996s)]
*  against a [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2892.18s)]
*  coup d'etat if you will a democratic coup d'etat and uh [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2893.62s)]
*  The difference between 2020 and 2024 [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2899.38s)]
*  Is you will have the media defining whatever the grievances are of the losing democratic party as being fair [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2902.58s)]
*  Grievances when in fact they're not whatever I don't know which ones they'll come up with [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2909.2799999999997s)]
*  But they'll come up with stories that are not true [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2913.8599999999997s)]
*  and uh [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2916.9s)]
*  That's what they're good at republicans [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2918.2599999999998s)]
*  Accept results for the most part, which is why trump's [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2920.98s)]
*  push back in 2020 was it was so [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2924.5s)]
*  Out of character for the world to understand [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2928.42s)]
*  Democrats always contest results. I mean, I can't remember a campaign nationally that they didn't contest once one way or another something [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2931.84s)]
*  Whether it was gore were they lost? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2939.46s)]

*  and uh [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2943.94s)]
*  And so it will be a contentious [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2945.86s)]
*  Transition period but I think the difference is if trump has the results that I think he's going to have [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2948.1800000000003s)]
*  He'll be close to or over 300 electoral votes [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2956.58s)]
*  That's hard to turn over before them to fight. You really think so trump's getting at 300. Well, I mean there are seven battleground states [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2960.26s)]
*  Trump's if you trump loses all seven, I think he's it's something like 254 if he wins all 70s at 312 [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2967.86s)]
*  If you win some combination in between [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2976.3599999999997s)]
*  Um, you know, so and the only one that worries below 270 is where she sweeps to the blue wall [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2979.08s)]
*  um [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2985.7999999999997s)]
*  And I don't see her doing that [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2987.16s)]
*  I reach we could sweep the blue wall right now. We're leading in all three of those states [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2989.24s)]
*  um [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=2994.6s)]

*  And the three midwestern states she has to win why are those democratic states i've never understood that at all [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3001.18s)]
*  Those seem like natural trump states given the realignment between the parties [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3007.2599999999998s)]
*  labor was labor's got [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3011.8999999999996s)]

*  the auto workers that [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3038.3s)]
*  Biden harris administration was the worst administration for them and she'll be even worse as as president harris, uh, and that's why [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3040.86s)]

*  She's got a problem with the muslim vote in uh in in michigan and it's their major piece [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3080.2200000000003s)]
*  Of a democratic coalition to carry that state. They're fragmented [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3086.86s)]
*  There there's going to be a lot of non-vote voters in that and and trump was endorsed by the largest muslim pakistan [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3090.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh organization in michigan last week [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3099.26s)]
*  So, you know it and they're doing that because they know that trump [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3103.1000000000004s)]
*  Is somebody who could bring peace to the middle east [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3108.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean he almost did that if he had had a second term he would we wouldn't have had this war in the gulf [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3111.5800000000004s)]
*  Uh, and at the same time the jewish support trump's getting close to 40 of the jewish support [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3116.7000000000003s)]
*  Because they know that he protected israel and he's and when he says he's going to protect him [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3121.82s)]
*  He means what he says versus what biden says when he talks being pro-yetan pro-israel [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3126.3s)]
*  But not but anti-netanyahu right now in a war you can't be both [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3132.7000000000003s)]
*  You have to be [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3137.42s)]
*  Pro pro-netanyahu and pro-israel trump has credibility in the israeli community has credibility in the muslim community [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3139.1800000000003s)]
*  There's nobody in the democratic party like that [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3146.46s)]
*  and uh [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3149.1000000000004s)]
*  And in michigan, that's a real [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3150.46s)]
*  Cross pressure on harris at the base. So the three states that she has to win to be president [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3152.6200000000003s)]
*  She's trailing in all three [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3159.98s)]
*  That will have [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3162.6200000000003s)]
*  A long-term impact I think on realignment because you know trump [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3164.38s)]
*  Also understands that uh [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3170.78s)]
*  that [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3174.3s)]
*  The leadership may not be for the rank and file is but he makes if he makes the rank and files lives better [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3175.5s)]
*  The leadership has to start to to open up and be less less oppressive [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3181.82s)]
*  And really when you look at the the uh [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3188.38s)]
*  The public service unions and the private sector, uh unions [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3191.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3197.5s)]
*  There's a real break now at the at the grassroots level. Oh, yeah, and uh, and [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3198.86s)]
*  The public sector unions are going to have a hard time under trump because he's going to make changes that are going to be [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3204.94s)]
*  that are going to call [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3212.06s)]
*  Government reductions. I hope he extinguishes them crushes them [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3213.66s)]
*  We shouldn't have a single public sector union in the united states the whole idea is grotesque [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3217.82s)]
*  Well, it's tax dollars held hostage by by federal employees or state employees. The whole thing's nuts [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3223.1800000000003s)]
*  They pay for their own politicians. Yeah, and they're not union leaders. They're democrats [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3229.98s)]
*  With union positions they run copy machines and man some [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3235.1800000000003s)]
*  Desk at the dmv. I mean these are not late. There's not laborers. These are [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3239.42s)]
*  People's living off the public tent and it's disgusting very well. Yes. No, that's right and uh [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3243.66s)]
*  And that's why you had people like the teams [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3250.7799999999997s)]
*  Head of the teams is nationally coming speaking to the rubric. Oh, it's a good man. Sean o'brien from boston [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3253.5s)]
*  And and you know trump didn't require a litmus test support [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3259.5s)]
*  He said come and make your case [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3264.06s)]
*  Yeah, and that resonates with the rank and file people that when you show respect to the union [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3265.66s)]
*  When the union is just being is not [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3272.14s)]
*  Taking a pro position [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3275.66s)]
*  But that's who trump is [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3277.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean he recognizes that every day is another day and you build by consensus and and [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3279.02s)]
*  And communication which is why again the the the globalist and the elitist that the state department can't handle a guy because [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3286.2999999999997s)]
*  He doesn't read from their playbook [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3295.1s)]
*  and uh [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3297.8999999999996s)]
*  And he doesn't even look at their playbook because he thinks their playbook is wrong [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3298.94s)]
*  And frankly having dealt with a lot of those kinds of people over my 40 years in politics. He's right [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3303.9s)]
*  So given um [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3311.26s)]
*  Trump's position the seven battleground states ahead [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3313.7400000000002s)]
*  Um, what you know within the margin but still ahead [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3317.26s)]
*  In all of them, um and given the vibe shift elon musk coming out for trump [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3320.78s)]
*  Bunch of tech people coming out for trump. I think most people if they're honest think trump's gonna win [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3325.26s)]
*  What if he doesn't win? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3329.98s)]
*  Will republicans accept that result is legitimate? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3331.7400000000002s)]
*  The answer is [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3338.2200000000003s)]
*  Ultimately, yes [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3341.1800000000003s)]
*  I think I mean honestly, I don't [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3343.34s)]
*  Deal with that scenario now because in my mind we're not going to lose [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3346.46s)]
*  um [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3351.82s)]
*  I mean [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3353.02s)]
*  If we lost [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3354.62s)]
*  How we lost would be relevant [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3356.22s)]
*  Yeah, and uh [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3358.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't believe that if you lose you don't have a right to to question [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3360.46s)]
*  but then you [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3365.8199999999997s)]
*  There comes a point when you have to move on [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3367.5s)]
*  um [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3370.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3371.74s)]
*  So how we lose would be relevant, um, but I don't see that happening [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3375.02s)]
*  A lot of republicans [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3381.58s)]
*  Think that the system is rigged against them [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3383.66s)]
*  And I understand that uh, I bet you do [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3387.98s)]
*  Oh, do you understand that [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3394.2999999999997s)]
*  But [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3397.66s)]
*  The point is you you just can't give up [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3399.58s)]
*  and [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3403.5s)]
*  And you just have to be better than you were before to to to succeed the next time [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3404.54s)]
*  And you can't [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3411.34s)]
*  Complain about the past you have to do something about the future. One of the things that i'm actually [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3413.58s)]
*  very proud of what trump has done in the last this cycle is [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3419.2599999999998s)]
*  He doesn't think you should have early voting. You know, he thinks election day should be election day [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3423.8199999999997s)]
*  but he [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3429.74s)]
*  recognizes that you got to play by the rules that are the rules today and uh [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3431.08s)]
*  and uh [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3437.34s)]
*  The equivalent what we've done in the past two election cycles of ignoring early day voting is like in baseball having designated batter [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3439.42s)]
*  But since he's not on the field, you just don't let him [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3447.5s)]
*  Go up to bat you just you know take it out every time he that spot comes up in the batting order [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3451.18s)]
*  That's what we were doing in early voting. We were not participating [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3456.62s)]
*  and and [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3460.38s)]
*  And the democrats were and it did two things it energized their people early [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3461.74s)]
*  It got it banked votes [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3466.7799999999997s)]
*  Before the campaign was over so that we always 2020 our closing campaign was much stronger [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3469.1s)]
*  Uh than the than the campaign in in around the convention and in september [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3475.8999999999996s)]
*  But so many people had already voted that many of whom would have possibly changed and voted differently if they had only been [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3480.62s)]
*  one election day [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3488.14s)]
*  So as you know right now the reason one of the things the trump campaign did very well this time [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3491.02s)]
*  Is we were doing a mid october campaign [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3496.3799999999997s)]
*  campaign [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3501.08s)]
*  uh program [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3502.3799999999997s)]
*  in [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3504.06s)]
*  august and september [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3505.02s)]
*  Because we knew that early voting was starting in in october [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3507.02s)]
*  And so we had to have the electorate's mindset where they normally would be on october 20th [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3511.3399999999997s)]
*  There on october 1st [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3517.2599999999998s)]
*  So that means we had to be defining her [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3519.2599999999998s)]
*  Heavily in in september we had to be defining the differences between trump and her [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3522.06s)]
*  In august, uh, and we had to be spending the kind of money that was necessary to have the penetration [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3527.9s)]
*  So that by now we're focusing on the last five percent not on the 50 percent we need [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3534.7s)]
*  And we've done that well and that's why the campaign is closing [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3542.62s)]
*  where [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3547.42s)]
*  You're starting to see the race tilt publicly towards trump the betting markets are tilting that way the market [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3548.62s)]
*  The stock market I think is pricing in if you look at the kind of companies that are going up [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3555.8199999999997s)]
*  There are companies that would deal do well in a deregulated economy under a president trump [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3561.8999999999996s)]
*  um [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3568.14s)]
*  So all of that's happening because our closing campaign was happening in september [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3569.34s)]
*  And now we're getting out the vote because they're ready to vote. We've talked to them and they're now voting [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3574.94s)]
*  That's all stuff. We gave up on last time. We were running our october campaign last time in october [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3581.98s)]
*  And by september they made their [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3588.3s)]
*  They had defined us because early voting isn't just who gets to vote [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3591.58s)]
*  It's how you persuade them to before they vote and they were doing their september [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3596.14s)]
*  Their october close in september getting their votes banked and we were talking to people that already voted [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3601.18s)]
*  And by the time we did our closing campaign in october [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3607.42s)]
*  That's changed this time trump has done a masterful job [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3611.3399999999997s)]
*  His campaign leadership has been brilliant at this at putting the calendar of when people vote [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3614.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah into the strategy of how we run the campaign and they've done so and [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3620.7s)]
*  You know, and as you said to your point a little while ago [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3625.9s)]
*  This is a guy that should be have been dead five or six times as a candidate [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3629.66s)]
*  And he's now heading into the last two weeks as the front runner [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3634.7799999999997s)]
*  And cheerfully and you're doing the same and I it does feel like that's part of the key to living a successful happy life is [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3638.62s)]
*  Dealing with realities you find it and letting go of the past [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3646.46s)]
*  When you know, you've been in dc since the entire time I was there as a very famous republican [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3649.42s)]
*  Operative working in foreign countries and all over all over the world [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3655.26s)]
*  Was all fine. Then you become trump's campaign manager for like 20 minutes and the next thing you know [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3658.78s)]
*  They're sending you off to prison you got sent to prison because you work for trump [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3663.9s)]
*  Nobody republican or democrat in dc doubted that for one second period [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3667.42s)]
*  so [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3671.7400000000002s)]
*  I just think that's a fact. It is a fact. It was andrew weisman did this because you work for trump [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3673.02s)]
*  How do you let go of that and stay cheerful and forward-looking you don't seem bitter at all [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3677.3399999999997s)]
*  We just had breakfast you weren't ranting about anything. How do you do? How do you do that? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3682.46s)]
*  well, you have to have [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3687.42s)]
*  Faith which I do have family which I do [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3688.8599999999997s)]
*  and believe in yourself, which I do and [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3692.8599999999997s)]
*  and when you're advising people on all of the [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3697.1s)]
*  contradictions of politics and in the world [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3700.6s)]
*  You got to recognize that that affects you too [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3704.0600000000004s)]
*  And so if people have got to make adjustments because of contradictions that they see that they don't like [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3706.94s)]
*  Then I felt I needed to as well and [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3712.6200000000003s)]
*  Look, but that's a lot easier to describe than to pull off [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3715.26s)]
*  Well, except it's over now [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3719.1000000000004s)]
*  For me i've gone through that crucible and uh, pulling it off was hard [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3721.42s)]
*  But that's where faith and family came into account and that was where the strength was. Did you make a decision not to be angry? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3726.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3733.02s)]
*  when [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3734.2200000000003s)]
*  Well when I was in solitary confinement when I was in solitary confinement, uh, you know the biggest [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3736.3s)]
*  Part of a crisis like what I went through was before [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3742.86s)]
*  You're thrown into the fire [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3746.7000000000003s)]
*  When you're standing by the fire and the you're seeing the fire flames can grow and and the fear of being in that fire [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3748.46s)]
*  Is overwhelming [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3756.38s)]
*  Once you're sitting in the fire you either [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3758.1400000000003s)]
*  Give up and die [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3761.02s)]
*  Literally in some cases, but certainly figuratively or you make adjustments to how to live in the fire [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3763.1800000000003s)]
*  and I made the adjustment that [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3769.34s)]
*  That I had incredible family lots of good friends [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3772.46s)]
*  Some people who weren't my friends anymore, but that's fine. That means they weren't really good friends and and my faith [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3776.7000000000003s)]
*  carried me through uh [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3783.26s)]
*  And I decided that when I got through it when it was over [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3785.42s)]
*  If I then was going to be bitter and angry [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3790.06s)]
*  Then that means i'd be reliving the worst parts of it all and why would I do that? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3793.2599999999998s)]
*  And uh, and so I decided I was going to move on. I mean, yeah [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3798.62s)]
*  My wife said something to me that was very prophetic in the beginning. I mean I started my career in washington with nothing [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3803.66s)]
*  I was being from a blue collar family. I you know, you know, I really had no money at all [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3809.18s)]
*  I made a living I did well [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3815.18s)]
*  They took it all away from me. My wife was saying to me in the process. Look we started with nothing [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3817.3399999999997s)]
*  We have we found each other. We'll still have each other and that's what counts [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3822.62s)]
*  And she was right and that that kept me going when we started this show [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3827.42s)]
*  We were looking for a very specific sponsor. We wanted to find a company that could send us good meat [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3831.74s)]
*  Better than anything you could buy in a grocery store [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3839.1s)]
*  They didn't have a lot of weird hormones in it or chemicals just good meat from the united states [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3841.1s)]
*  And we found one and we are proud to partner with them [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3846.62s)]

*  That I had given myself for them [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3965.18s)]
*  And there was a lot of love in that room. I noticed I saw it and and it made me really feel [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3969.02s)]
*  Validated that I did the right thing [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3976.68s)]

*  Um, I really couldn't I hope that I would behave as manfully as you have and as forgivingly as you have [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3988.54s)]
*  That said the forces that put you in jail because you were donald trump's campaign manager. That's the reason [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=3994.14s)]
*  Um, they still exist and they still have power. And so if trump becomes president, what does he do about that? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4000.2999999999997s)]
*  What does he do about andrew weisman? I see him on television. I can hardly believe that guy has any credibility [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4005.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4012.62s)]

*  rallies key [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4022.8599999999997s)]
*  Campaign slogans was lock her up lock her up [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4024.7s)]
*  When he got elected president, you never heard that word once no he didn't and that's because that's not who he is [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4029.18s)]
*  He's not a vengeful man. No, that's for sure and uh, and [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4035.18s)]
*  He can he can use a little bit of financialness sometime [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4039.02s)]
*  But he's not and and he put contrary to what harris and biden said about him [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4042.14s)]
*  He put the country first as president and he said that I gotta work with the democrats if I try and lock her up [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4047.5s)]
*  You know, I will destroy my ability to to be an effective president [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4054.62s)]
*  And even when they were impeaching him, he was still working with the democrats on policy stuff [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4058.9399999999996s)]
*  um [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4064.22s)]
*  so [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4065.5s)]
*  What will he do as president? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4066.86s)]
*  Number 47 [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4070.06s)]
*  I think he'll do a lot of what he did as number 45 [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4071.82s)]
*  He will focus on things an agenda that will make the country better that make america great again [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4075.26s)]
*  Which is his because he sees this is his legacy term now [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4080.6200000000003s)]
*  and he doesn't want it to be filled with the [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4084.6200000000003s)]
*  the kind of [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4088.54s)]
*  anger and and uh [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4090.2200000000003s)]
*  And volatility of the first term with all the impeachments and things like that [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4092.2999999999997s)]
*  And so I think he understands getting even is not getting smart [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4096.54s)]
*  And I will be surprised if he does anything but reach out across the aisle and try and to make pass the legislation [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4101.179999999999s)]
*  That will make the country better [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4107.34s)]
*  What do you do about cia? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4108.94s)]
*  And doj and these institutions which have been instruments of the democratic party's political agenda [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4111.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think he he understands [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4118.219999999999s)]
*  Government better than he did in 26 17 [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4121.18s)]
*  and [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4125.58s)]
*  He knows the dangers that the wrong people in office can be can cause [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4127.66s)]
*  Not just at the top level but inside the system as well [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4132.9400000000005s)]
*  And so I think there will be blue blue ribbon kind of commissions [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4136.46s)]
*  To you know, like carter did with stansfield turner [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4140.78s)]
*  I had the cia and when the cia was coming through all the iran contra stuff and things like that [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4144.54s)]
*  every reaction not around contra, but uh, the watergate stuff where he uh [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4150.46s)]
*  He had a commission put together [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4156.139999999999s)]
*  That cleaned up the cia in new to the cia [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4158.78s)]
*  Something I thought was bad at the time. I realized was probably good. Hey, probably pretty good. Yes, and uh, and I think [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4162.38s)]
*  Not just the cia. I think all of the departments and agencies where you have [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4169.98s)]
*  Bureaucrats who have got their own agendas not the american people's agenda [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4174.7s)]
*  I think they will all be tested and that's really what he's talking to elon musk about. I mean government [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4179.099999999999s)]
*  Government cutting government is getting rid of not just the fat of government but getting rid of the poison of government and uh, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4185.099999999999s)]
*  And some of them are not just policies. They're people [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4192.379999999999s)]
*  and uh [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4195.179999999999s)]
*  Or departments I should say and the departments are defined by the people [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4196.78s)]
*  and uh [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4201.58s)]
*  And I think trump is looking to reform government not not [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4203.02s)]
*  Reform in a getting rid of anybody who doesn't agree with him [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4207.160000000001s)]
*  But reform government to put people make the system work the way the system is supposed to work [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4211.26s)]
*  To protect the american people not a political party or a political structure [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4216.38s)]
*  Are you confident that he's got the right candidates for say state department for cia director [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4222.14s)]
*  dod [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4228.700000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean the the i'm not sure who he's planning to put in in all those positions [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4230.3s)]
*  I don't know that he is yet [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4234.62s)]
*  I think he knows what he needs now versus what he needed last time [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4236.62s)]
*  Uh, and and I think there are enough people who have manifested themselves as committed to his make america great agenda [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4241.5s)]
*  Uh, which is an agenda that is pro-american not pro-trump [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4250.54s)]
*  Uh [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4256.860000000001s)]
*  That he'll be able to find the right people to do that [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4258.14s)]
*  You don't seem worried that the country is going to fall into some sort of permanent conflict after november [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4262.14s)]
*  There'll be conflict [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4268.14s)]
*  But I think you can't let yourself [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4269.580000000001s)]
*  Be governed by the fear of conflict versus the fear of doing something right [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4272.54s)]
*  and [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4277.26s)]
*  I mean, I believe in I mean, you know, I hear all these things, but I know trump i've known trump since 1981 [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4278.54s)]
*  Um since 81 1981 [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4285.12s)]
*  What where'd you meet him? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4287.599999999999s)]
*  He was one of our first clients when I started black men at fort and stone in 1980 [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4288.88s)]
*  After reagan was elected president [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4294.0s)]
*  Um, what did you do for him? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4296.0s)]
*  Well, he he wanted [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4298.08s)]
*  Roger stone one of my partners in 1980 [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4300.72s)]
*  Handled the northeast for ronald reagan in new york and in the course of running that operation he got to know trump [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4303.5199999999995s)]
*  and trump [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4310.96s)]
*  Always interested in politics [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4312.16s)]
*  Uh and wanted to have sort of eyes and ears in washington. He liked roger and so he hired us [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4314.16s)]
*  To just be his political eyes and ears in washington and he had things we did but as a result we got like what? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4320.96s)]
*  There's so there there there were legitimate issues that we get involved in government [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4329.12s)]
*  but uh [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4334.639999999999s)]
*  But uh, are you just gonna i'll lie right over that i've been glad right over that [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4336.32s)]

*  But i've known i know him. I know what's in his heart. I've seen the way people who work for him [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4344.24s)]
*  really respect him and appreciate him i've seen him do things that [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4349.5199999999995s)]
*  You never hear about [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4355.12s)]
*  for for people that work that are [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4356.72s)]
*  the doorman at one of his hotels or [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4360.0s)]
*  You know somebody who worked on one of his construction sites or a family of one of his families that worked for him [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4362.72s)]
*  Uh, he's got a big heart [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4368.16s)]
*  He doesn't have he's not motivated by vengeance or anger he's motivated by getting things done [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4370.32s)]
*  He doesn't start fights. He finishes them doesn't know sometimes it stops sooner [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4377.12s)]
*  But he he doesn't live a life [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4382.0s)]
*  That's directed at revenge [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4385.76s)]
*  And he's not the person that the media is trying to define him as no no and uh, and so [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4388.08s)]
*  I think the greater good is what's going to move him in his legacy term [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4393.44s)]
*  Uh [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4397.36s)]
*  What's the relevance of cryptocurrency in this election do you think all the crypto people seem for trump is that meaningful? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4400.24s)]
*  Uh, well the no what I do know [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4406.24s)]
*  Trump feels like the crypto world is part of the future of our of the economic structure of the world [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4409.28s)]
*  and he sees the the biden harris administration [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4416.96s)]
*  as pushing it offshore into the hands of china and into the hands of uh, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4421.2s)]
*  Of the darker side of the of the of the economy [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4426.72s)]
*  And his attitude is the best way to influence the proper growth is to bring it onshore [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4430.4s)]
*  To regulate it properly and let it become an american industry just like dretton dretton woods did to the dollar [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4435.599999999999s)]
*  in the aftermath of world war ii [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4443.12s)]
*  And it's as simple as that [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4445.76s)]
*  I mean [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4450.24s)]
*  That seems like it's gonna happen doesn't it yeah it does well you said that one of the reasons people [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4452.08s)]
*  Um are voting for trump or one of the issues on which he has the advantage is his stewardship of the rest of the world [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4458.48s)]
*  of the american empire [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4463.92s)]
*  which uh, you know has been in a very different place for the last four years [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4465.68s)]
*  We have run the verge of global conflict under the stewardship of biden harris [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4470.24s)]
*  Not an overstatement if trump selected [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4476.4s)]
*  How is he going to? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4479.92s)]
*  Prevent world war three from happening. What does he do? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4482.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, he knows the world leaders and the world leaders know him. Yep, and [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4485.5199999999995s)]
*  They respect him as a strong leader something they don't feel about biden or harris [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4491.68s)]
*  and so [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4498.4s)]
*  They know they can negotiate with him they can talk with him [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4500.08s)]
*  But they also know there's a fine point that there's a real line in the sand to use the obama line or red lines news analogy [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4503.76s)]
*  And for example in the gulf [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4512.16s)]
*  You know with this mess in the gulf [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4514.24s)]
*  Why did that happen? Why is why is the gulf in the kind of tumultuous in right now? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4516.96s)]
*  because [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4522.16s)]
*  There's no the the countries in the gulf don't trust the united states [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4523.36s)]
*  That's true. I mean, that's the bottom line and trump understood who the enemy [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4528.4s)]
*  Of the gulf states were [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4534.0s)]
*  As well as the enemy of the united states. It was one country. It was iraq [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4536.72s)]
*  Iran [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4539.84s)]
*  Biden is an apologist for iraq [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4542.0s)]
*  harris is an apologist for iraq they buy into the john carrey theory of iraq [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4544.8s)]
*  and [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4550.320000000001s)]
*  The saudi arabia the united arab emirates the oman omanis [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4552.320000000001s)]
*  None of them buy into iraq as a as a country of a leader in the gulf [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4557.6s)]
*  What trump was doing with the abraham accords? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4566.08s)]
*  Was meant to bring peace to the region [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4568.8s)]
*  What he was doing with iran from day one was meant to [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4571.5199999999995s)]
*  Defang iran impoverish iran as a political country and allow the people the opportunity to rise up against the [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4575.42s)]
*  the fascist regime that the mullahs are running there [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4584.4s)]
*  and [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4589.12s)]
*  And it was working [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4591.76s)]
*  I mean the abraham accords if trump had been reelected saudi would have signed it jordan was you know signing it [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4592.72s)]
*  uh israel was bound to it and they were and [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4599.04s)]
*  That was moving towards [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4601.68s)]
*  A peaceful resolution and an isolation of iraq [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4604.0s)]
*  When biden became president [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4608.72s)]
*  He immediately [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4611.52s)]
*  You know reinstituted as best he could the the nuclear deal with it with iran giving them even more than they had and wanted [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4613.52s)]
*  Gave them billions of dollars that they then used to fund [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4620.719999999999s)]
*  Terrorist activities around the world and against india real [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4624.0s)]
*  And he told more importantly the other gulf states [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4627.84s)]
*  That they can't trust the united states [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4631.92s)]
*  So what is they what did the mbs of this world do what did the [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4635.5199999999995s)]
*  Emirates do [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4640.32s)]
*  They started reaching out to china. They started reaching out to russia [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4641.679999999999s)]
*  Why because they needed protection against an unreliable united states [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4644.96s)]
*  And they didn't want to be find themselves isolated [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4651.04s)]
*  In some kind of axis of the world against that is that is literally true [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4655.52s)]
*  I mean the emirates was attacked by iranian proxies and the u.s was incredibly slow to respond [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4659.280000000001s)]
*  To protect them. These are small countries. That's correct, right? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4666.160000000001s)]
*  it's so [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4669.200000000001s)]
*  This is an area where trump immediately has credibility [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4671.599999999999s)]
*  As the right leader in the gulf with everybody but iran [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4674.96s)]
*  I mean, I happen to think that [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4678.96s)]
*  Iran is already measuring what it's going to be like to be under president trump and they're backing off certain things right now [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4680.96s)]
*  And their right to do that because trump is going to come in and reinstitute the trump policies on iran [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4688.639999999999s)]
*  I mean there were two countries that were enemies of the united states in trump's eyes [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4693.44s)]
*  uh that needed to be [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4699.04s)]
*  impoverished in order to then be brought into the world community [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4701.2s)]
*  iran was one of those two [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4704.96s)]
*  and uh [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4707.12s)]
*  The other was russia and uh [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4708.24s)]
*  And he was with iran he couldn't the mullahs wouldn't talk to him with russia [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4712.16s)]
*  Kutun was smart enough to know you talk to trump and that's why a dialogue was existing that could grow into [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4717.28s)]
*  some kind of [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4724.5599999999995s)]
*  uh [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4725.76s)]
*  Relationship and for all of these [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4727.26s)]
*  People who accuse trump of being soft on putin one they know that's not true, but two [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4730.4800000000005s)]
*  It's part of a philosophy at uh at the state department and in the davos world [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4736.64s)]
*  that [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4742.08s)]
*  If you just ignore your enemy [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4743.120000000001s)]
*  It's going to get better [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4745.76s)]
*  And trump says if you don't engage your enemy or your adversary [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4747.84s)]
*  Or your competitor whatever the case might be [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4753.4400000000005s)]
*  Uh that the that you're never going to get better [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4756.320000000001s)]
*  And that things will find a way to get worse [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4759.92s)]
*  And so that's why he would cross over the dmz to see kim jihyeon on his own without state department freaking out that he decided [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4763.360000000001s)]
*  Waking up that morning that he wanted to do it [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4771.84s)]
*  Um, I was with him. I saw that yeah, yeah [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4774.320000000001s)]
*  That that was a kind of ad hoc trip. Yeah, and but he but he understood [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4777.68s)]
*  Let kim jihyeon look in my eyes. Let putin look in my eyes. Let ji jian ping look at my eyes [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4782.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean the message he sent to ji jian ping that was the most [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4787.04s)]
*  Impactful message he sent to china during his whole presidency [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4789.9800000000005s)]
*  Was when he was having the state uh state dinner for ji jian ping and he was sitting right next to ji jian ping [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4793.84s)]
*  And he leaned over in the middle of the dinner and said I just want you to know we just killed uh, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4800.400000000001s)]
*  sulamani [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4806.22s)]
*  If you look at the the cameras ji jian ping's face [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4808.72s)]
*  Turned white [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4813.04s)]
*  I mean [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4814.48s)]
*  Here the president of the united states before any of the people in that room who were part of his government [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4815.599999999999s)]
*  U.s. Government knew president trump was letting ji jian ping know [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4820.08s)]
*  This is how we treat our enemies [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4824.32s)]
*  and [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4827.5199999999995s)]
*  The world got the relationship between china and in the u.s under trump [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4829.04s)]
*  Tense at times, but it worked the relationship worked. They were dealing with issues [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4833.839999999999s)]
*  Uh, you know, they weren't solving everything but they were dealing with them [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4838.879999999999s)]
*  Uh, and the same thing was going on with putin same thing was going on with uh with iran [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4842.96s)]
*  Although he wasn't communicating with them directly but indirectly he was letting them know [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4848.0s)]
*  That we're going to impoverish you and we're going to do everything we can until you become a real reliable nation of the world [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4852.48s)]
*  Uh, but more important than that the way he was treating iran was giving confidence to the allies in the gulf [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4859.44s)]
*  That will be your friend [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4865.92s)]
*  Uh, and we'll be there for you. You know, what is what is you know, what are the uae and and saudi [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4868.32s)]
*  Arabia want in the future? They're trying to bring their countries into the modern world [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4874.4800000000005s)]
*  They're trying to expand the petrol dollars into improving their their economies and to then [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4878.8s)]
*  Each of them is doing a different different way [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4884.8s)]
*  But all of it is looking at how do we protect ourselves against our number one enemy, which is iran? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4887.68s)]
*  Uh, and [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4894.08s)]
*  That's the u.s [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4895.4400000000005s)]
*  What do they want? They want an umbrella of peace. How do they get an umbrella of peace? The abraham accord was part of it [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4897.04s)]
*  The saudi's would like to have a the kind of [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4904.88s)]
*  Commitment from the united states that we gave to japan after world war two where we said that we would you are under our protection [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4908.56s)]
*  and that uh, uh, yeah, a [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4915.28s)]
*  That to have a military force there not to be fighting wars there [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4918.24s)]
*  But just to be under our protection because that sends sufficient signal to the center in the in southeast asia [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4922.0s)]
*  And it'll send it in the gulf to iran to not mess with the uh, the sunnis [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4928.64s)]
*  Uh, how does he is he gonna end the war in ukraine which doesn't seem to be helping anybody? I think so I think [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4934.16s)]
*  I think he understands that you cannot have this war continue [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4942.64s)]
*  Um, and I think he will sit down with all sides [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4947.5199999999995s)]
*  And he's got I mean, i'm not giving you saying anything out of school [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4952.799999999999s)]
*  But he's gonna make them all understand it's in the world's best interest and their best interest to put this war behind [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4957.759999999999s)]
*  and he's [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4964.48s)]
*  There's some tools that he can use [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4965.92s)]
*  to [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4968.16s)]
*  Make each side come to the table and seriously just negotiate [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4969.04s)]
*  um [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4974.5599999999995s)]
*  But he will personally inject himself into it. He's won't give it to a [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4975.68s)]
*  You know third party person to do it. He will make this on the front end [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4980.0s)]
*  his responsibility and I think he believes that [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4984.08s)]
*  Without getting way too complicated all the parties at the table the europeans the russians the ukrainians [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4989.200000000001s)]
*  All have have reason to want this thing to end [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=4999.4400000000005s)]
*  And there's pieces that can [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5003.200000000001s)]
*  Forget the public rhetoric and the public decisions. There are there are things that can happen that all sides can [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5005.280000000001s)]
*  accept [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5011.900000000001s)]
*  If they know that it's going to be [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5013.360000000001s)]
*  Pushed on them by somebody who will enforce it [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5015.6s)]
*  Biden is not that person [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5019.12s)]
*  Blinken doesn't scare a person when he sits down [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5020.8s)]
*  In fact, they would surprise he sits at the table as opposed to in this chair behind the table [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5023.360000000001s)]
*  Uh, he's just not a leader. Um [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5028.64s)]
*  And uh [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5030.8s)]
*  And so that presence of of the president hovering over everything injecting himself into it [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5033.360000000001s)]
*  Plus his relationships with all of those people. I mean, you know, even zelinski, uh [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5040.0s)]
*  Was there when trump was the president the first time? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5045.4400000000005s)]
*  Will have a lot more impact [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5049.12s)]
*  Right now there's nobody running the ukraine peace process nobody [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5052.0s)]
*  uh, the europeans don't have the the [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5056.88s)]
*  vision [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5060.64s)]
*  Or the will to take a a [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5063.76s)]
*  Position against putin that will force putin to give into ukraine [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5068.160000000001s)]
*  And they don't have a strong position against putin that will force ukraine to give into [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5074.400000000001s)]
*  But I mean europe if you look at europe just go to europe, um over the last [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5080.400000000001s)]
*  Almost three years now since this war started in february of 2022 [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5086.88s)]
*  Europe has declined [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5091.52s)]
*  In every sense. I mean, it's just a poorer more chaotic place than it was three years ago [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5093.84s)]
*  I mean, this is crushing europe [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5098.96s)]
*  So I don't understand why there's no european leader who can particularly in germany, but not just [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5101.12s)]
*  And take control and bring this to an end because it's killing their continent [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5107.6s)]
*  Who's a european leader that has stature? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5112.320000000001s)]
*  Fair I mean [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5116.320000000001s)]
*  And so they're all just [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5118.4s)]
*  Invention their own self-survival inside their countries. I mean murkel had a sort of [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5120.88s)]
*  More european oriented reputation, but germany's not the one to lead europe in a way. That's a disaster. Yeah, and [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5126.88s)]
*  Yeah, and there's and there's nobody else [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5135.28s)]
*  There's no thatcher. I mean there is no there's no even burlesconi, uh, who could have you know, pressed certain things [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5137.36s)]
*  Uh, you know schultz is probably on his way out [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5144.32s)]
*  Uh in germany mccone is on his way out [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5147.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, you know the spanish are you know, they [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5151.04s)]
*  You don't even know who's in office these days [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5154.16s)]
*  Uh, you know the italians baloney is emerging. She's she's becoming one of the more forceful leaders in europe [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5156.32s)]
*  But she's doing it gradually. She has not emerged as a pan european [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5163.92s)]
*  No, she certainly hasn't but but she's getting but she is emerging because she's been willing to do certain things [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5168.48s)]
*  And then the eastern europeans are frozen out by the western europeans where you have some of the stronger leaders [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5175.28s)]
*  um [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5181.759999999999s)]
*  So [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5182.719999999999s)]
*  There is nobody to solve the problem [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5183.599999999999s)]
*  They even though it's the european union [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5185.919999999999s)]
*  It's really the european disunion because all the countries have their own interest [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5188.799999999999s)]
*  And they they always they use the bureaucracy of the eu to enhance their interest [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5193.599999999999s)]
*  To the diminishment of the other members of the european union [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5199.2s)]
*  Uh at times but so none of them have the stature to lead a united front [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5202.8s)]
*  Against putin or against zolinski depending on what your position is. Do you think that they sense that their continent is dying? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5210.0s)]
*  No, because they've created this world and so they think it's the right world [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5218.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's you go to davos and you sit around and you realize these people live in a bubble [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5221.84s)]
*  Yeah, they have no idea. No, they have no idea and but but the bubble [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5227.36s)]
*  Is the bubble they created? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5231.679999999999s)]
*  and uh, and so like you see on the with the left here in the united states they think [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5233.92s)]
*  you know [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5239.679999999999s)]
*  Transgender is the future they think that uh, women men should be able to participate in female sports if they're transgender [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5240.94s)]
*  Well same thing in europe with globalism. They think this is the right way if just everybody will do what we say what we say [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5248.48s)]
*  Then they'll be better off [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5256.4s)]
*  and it is that that [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5258.4s)]
*  Davos mentality. Yeah. Well, they're a joke to the rest of the world and I guess they're always the last ones to know that they are [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5260.799999999999s)]
*  Um, so you think trump what would peace terms look like in ukraine? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5267.04s)]
*  And I should say for those who don't know you spent I don't know at least 10 years [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5270.96s)]
*  How long did you spend working 10 years 10 years working in ukraine almost one of the most powerful? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5274.48s)]
*  Outside political figures in ukraine deeply knowledgeable about it. You had an office there [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5280.24s)]
*  um [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5285.679999999999s)]
*  Not on the pro-russia side I should say [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5286.799999999999s)]
*  But what given your knowledge of that country and region what would a settlement realistic settlement look like? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5289.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, I I think they will [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5296.96s)]
*  A lot of the pieces may not necessarily be a part of ukraine [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5300.400000000001s)]
*  It's other things that russia might feel is important to them in russia or in dealing with certain other parts of the world [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5302.88s)]
*  Uh, or or some of their technology needs or things like that [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5310.0s)]
*  There are pieces to a game that that will interest putin [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5314.16s)]
*  That it can facilitate getting to russia sooner than later in a peace process [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5317.84s)]
*  negotiation [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5323.5s)]
*  Do the borders of ukraine change do you think well? [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5325.28s)]
*  Depends on how you look at kremeria ukraine still accepts who says kremeria belongs to ukraine russia says no [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5328.08s)]
*  ukraine is now a part of russia [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5334.8s)]
*  I think [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5338.08s)]
*  Crimea probably stays where they currently are positioned right now [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5339.4400000000005s)]
*  For sure. I don't see that happening right but zelensky and the ukrainians say we got to have ukraine back [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5343.76s)]
*  Ukraine yeah, but that's that's just silly. I mean, they're not going to give up the naval base, right? I mean that [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5351.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5355.84s)]
*  Putin thinks one of the biggest mistakes [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5357.6s)]
*  In the history of the soviet union was when khrushchev who was from ukraine [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5360.48s)]
*  in a moment of [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5366.08s)]
*  enthusiasm gave ukraine independence from russia [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5368.86s)]
*  You know the independence was in the soviet union was not really independence, right? [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5373.92s)]
*  But it gave them the ability to be considered a country on their own not a vassal state of the soviet union [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5378.24s)]
*  Putin never accepted that [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5386.64s)]
*  Um, and so when he became into power one of the first things he wanted to do [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5388.8s)]
*  Was get ukraine back into russia where he thought it belonged as you know, kiev was the first capital of yes of russia [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5393.76s)]
*  uh and [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5402.240000000001s)]
*  And and krymia which had an important [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5404.320000000001s)]
*  The military component for for russia where they had their their bases and where it was an access to the black sea [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5408.08s)]
*  um [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5416.56s)]
*  You know that was [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5417.92s)]
*  And it was a very russian [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5420.320000000001s)]
*  Enclave [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5424.160000000001s)]
*  As opposed to ukrainian [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5426.320000000001s)]
*  Um [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5428.32s)]
*  You know, that was the first place he struck when when when he had the saw the opportunity under obama [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5429.84s)]
*  I had uh, and so I think that will be [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5437.04s)]
*  I will be surprised if anything changes on your kremia. That's too much of a swallow [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5440.88s)]
*  Without russia losing the war. Yeah, and uh, do you see that happening? No, I don't I don't see them winning the war [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5446.48s)]
*  But I don't see them losing the war [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5453.2s)]
*  um, I think that [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5456.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's their economic issues of of rehabilitation of the country reconstruction because eastern ukraine is destroyed [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5458.719999999999s)]
*  Uh both the industry and the and the whole infrastructure [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5466.799999999999s)]
*  um [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5471.36s)]
*  I think eastern ukraine [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5472.719999999999s)]
*  Will be [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5474.88s)]
*  In some capacity still part of ukraine [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5476.88s)]
*  Whether they have autonomous zones but as a part of ukraine versus autonomous zones as autono truly autonomous [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5479.5199999999995s)]
*  You know that'll be part of the negotiation [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5487.04s)]
*  um zelensky can't give up west eastern ukraine [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5489.360000000001s)]
*  but [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5493.360000000001s)]
*  zelensky and the [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5494.64s)]
*  the [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5496.64s)]
*  center of [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5497.92s)]
*  Ukrainian universe is kiev and west not east of kiev [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5499.4400000000005s)]
*  um [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5504.0s)]
*  And so the destruction allows for some creativity the destruction of the east will allow some creativity on on the resolution of how we [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5505.12s)]
*  define the [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5513.200000000001s)]
*  Structuring of it. I don't think I don't think they give it up, but there may be some kind of [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5514.7s)]
*  Concessions that can be made that will save face for putin save territory for ukraine [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5523.16s)]
*  And get money into reconstructing. Uh, uh that part of the world [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5528.54s)]
*  Um, but there's a there's a way there's a play there [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5532.7s)]
*  There is a way to to get a ceasefire and to get the people talking and everybody wants that just nobody has the leadership do it [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5535.5s)]
*  Trump is the leader who can do it [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5543.74s)]
*  Um, and there's the there's the nato factor too, which will be relevant to putin [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5547.74s)]
*  uh, and uh some kind of [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5553.18s)]
*  Commitment that ukraine even as part of the european trade union trade association would never wouldn't be part of nato [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5556.14s)]
*  I think that's something that's on the table [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5564.62s)]
*  We did a live tour last month one of the funnest things we've ever done coast to coast 16 different cities [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5566.860000000001s)]
*  Speaking well next week our grand finale halloween october 31st [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5572.92s)]
*  2024 in glendale arizona our special guest that night days before the presidential election [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5578.86s)]
*  Donald trump all proceeds donated to hurricane relief. We're proud to do it. Hope to see you there [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5584.46s)]
*  You [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5590.96s)]
*  So for the years that you worked in ukraine [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5598.8s)]
*  Was ukraine joining nato something that most ukrainians wanted or that europe wanted [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5603.12s)]
*  no [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5608.88s)]
*  You create nato is a political issue [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5610.0s)]
*  Joining the european union is an economic issue, right? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5612.96s)]
*  And what the ukrainians cared about was the economic issue [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5616.64s)]
*  Um, yes, they they they wanted their independence [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5620.64s)]
*  But there wasn't they weren't fearful of russia invading before [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5625.280000000001s)]
*  Uh at that point, uh, and the russians didn't want nato on the border of ukraine. Well, yeah [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5630.08s)]
*  And so why did the biden administration? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5637.92s)]
*  So if the ukrainians weren't begging to be in nato and nato didn't want ukraine in nato [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5640.08s)]
*  Which I think is all true. Correct me if i'm wrong, you're correct [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5644.24s)]
*  Then why was the biden administration kamala harris specifically calling in public for ukraine to join nato? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5647.360000000001s)]
*  Like what would be the point of that because they're idiots [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5654.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I can't justify a policy that the europeans didn't want the ukrainians didn't want and the russians didn't want [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5657.4400000000005s)]
*  And the u.s was for okay. So then maybe if putin says and [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5663.92s)]
*  Says out loud and certainly [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5668.8s)]
*  Suggests it again and again if ukraine joins nato, I will move militarily against ukraine everyone knew that even I knew that [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5670.96s)]
*  Living a long way from ukraine [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5678.64s)]
*  And the biden administration says no, we want ukraine and nato and says that [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5681.4400000000005s)]
*  To zelensky in public in early february 2022. Maybe they wanted russia to invade ukraine [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5686.8s)]
*  Or maybe they're just stupid [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5696.24s)]
*  Because there was no [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5698.8s)]
*  I mean that was the red line [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5701.92s)]
*  Yeah, and there was and nobody wanted it [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5704.5599999999995s)]
*  except for biden, you know this macho approach to things and [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5708.24s)]
*  And and a truly a lack of understanding. It's not like i'm telling you anything. There was a secret [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5712.639999999999s)]
*  This was all publicly known. Yeah, I mean and and and universally known in ukraine, right? Right? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5718.24s)]
*  and and [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5724.88s)]
*  Very few people would have ever suggested that and that's what caused well [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5727.28s)]
*  the afghanistan debacle [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5733.04s)]
*  Right coupled with the threat of nato in ukraine [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5735.4400000000005s)]
*  And the lack of respect that putin had for anybody a part of the the foreign policy apparatus of biden that were part of the obama [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5739.6s)]
*  Government was all that was necessary to light the like the spark [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5747.76s)]
*  that create the fire and [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5752.88s)]
*  But there was no reason for it. It was an unforced error of mag of incredible consequence [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5755.68s)]
*  Well, yeah, how many people do you think have died in ukraine all in i'm told? [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5761.6s)]
*  over [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5766.72s)]
*  100,000 ukrainians [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5768.06s)]
*  and uh over 300,000 russians [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5769.76s)]
*  I don't know that but i'm told that so you were there you were working in ukraine in 2014 [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5772.64s)]
*  when maydaan happened [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5779.04s)]
*  We were told by our media that was just a popular uprising against a russian aligned government [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5781.5199999999995s)]
*  It was totally organic [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5787.44s)]
*  Now it looks like it was a coup orchestrated by the cia [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5789.68s)]
*  What was it and did you know what it was at the time? It was not organic. Okay? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5794.08s)]
*  It was not organic so it'd be option b then it was it was [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5801.12s)]
*  There were forces [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5808.96s)]
*  That saw an opportunity to unseat in a democratically elected president yanukovych [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5810.56s)]
*  Who acted in ways that were? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5817.84s)]
*  antidemocratic [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5820.54s)]
*  and um [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5822.56s)]
*  Where was the obama administration what side were they on? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5824.64s)]
*  They were supporting what was happening the the revolt that was going on in ukraine. Yeah. Okay, so [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5828.080000000001s)]
*  so the u.s state department was on the side of [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5834.72s)]
*  Extinguishing democracy overthrowing a democratically elected leader effectively. Yes. Yeah [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5837.28s)]
*  Where um, did you ever run into victoria newlin? [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5842.96s)]
*  Uh, I did [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5846.64s)]
*  What was your and she was I think living there part-time overseeing all this she was spending a lot of time there during that time frame [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5848.08s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, what was your impression of her? Uh that she should have been back in washington [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5855.12s)]
*  You're very diplomatic [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5861.6s)]
*  um [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5863.6s)]
*  So I I think the overwhelming evidence points to her role in a coup against the democratic elected president of that country yanukovych you work for [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5864.72s)]
*  Um, and then she comes back to dc and gets an even better job in the biden administration and then she's now retired [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5874.88s)]
*  Making a ton of money [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5881.12s)]
*  You by contrast went to prison for I can't even remember why and some fake reason [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5882.96s)]
*  That doesn't bother you at all [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5888.400000000001s)]
*  well [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5890.400000000001s)]
*  That seems very unfair. Well, it is unfair. Yeah [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5891.52s)]
*  I mean and and [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5895.280000000001s)]
*  Not that necessarily she gets rewarded and I get punished [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5897.2s)]
*  But we shouldn't be meddling in situations that are constitutional republic that are democratic republics [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5900.88s)]
*  countries that uh, we don't like the outcome of an election and uh, and [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5907.92s)]
*  Look yanukovych [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5914.8s)]
*  Proved himself in my judgment during the term of his presidency to be committed to europe [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5917.52s)]
*  There were issues he was dealing with [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5923.68s)]
*  That if they had been supported by brussels, uh to help ease ukraine's entrance into the european trade association agreement [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5926.64s)]
*  That we wouldn't have the mess we have today in ukraine [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5936.88s)]
*  um if we had respected the will of the people [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5940.72s)]
*  And the will of the government elected by the people and worked with that that government [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5944.0s)]
*  To bring them into ukraine as opposed to punish them for being the wrong guy to win the election [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5949.44s)]
*  Uh, then there wouldn't have been the environment that putin took advantage of [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5954.96s)]
*  That cost them. Crimea and cost them the destruction in eastern ukraine and the billions of dollars [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5959.599999999999s)]
*  That we've spent [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5967.04s)]
*  Uh, you know in support of the war that could have been spent for much better purposes [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5968.48s)]
*  How hard is it for you to sit and listen to these exact same people the ones who overthrew a [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5972.8s)]
*  democratically elected government in a foreign country with a coup using the cia and georgian snipers those people [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5977.36s)]
*  Telling you that donald trump is a quote threat to democracy. It must be kind of hard to watch that [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5985.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, it's why I got back in the saddle at this election to elect a president [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5989.92s)]
*  because [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5994.5599999999995s)]
*  We can't let those people win the elections. That's that's how I believe you fight you fight in elections [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=5996.0s)]
*  and uh and [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6002.16s)]
*  and I believe if you [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6004.0s)]
*  Look, i'm a man of faith. I believe that there's divine hand in a lot of stuff and uh, sometimes we may not understand [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6006.48s)]
*  Where it's leading us? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6013.76s)]
*  But if you think you know what's right, then you follow the course that is consistent with that [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6015.52s)]
*  and [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6021.36s)]
*  ukraine [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6022.32s)]
*  The mess that you that was created in ukraine [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6024.64s)]
*  in 2014 [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6028.24s)]
*  We're still paying the price for today [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6030.0s)]
*  And the the solution is not to have the same people who caused the problem stay in power to manage [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6032.56s)]
*  the issue but to change it and [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6039.76s)]
*  by happenstance [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6043.12s)]
*  There was an interim period between 2016 and 2020 when there was a u.s president [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6044.88s)]
*  Who was strong enough to keep peace in that region? [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6050.88s)]
*  Even though there was a screw-up in 2014 in the ukraine that was supported by the west of change in power [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6054.16s)]
*  And the opportunity now exists to bring that person back and that focus back and finish cleaning up the mess [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6061.12s)]
*  and uh [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6068.48s)]
*  And that's what keeps me going that what gloria or what victoria newland's reward was [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6070.5599999999995s)]
*  For creating the mess but just helping to fix the mess and clean it up for good. It's just the unfairness level is it [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6077.28s)]
*  All-time highs unfairness is we all know is not the way to drive your life [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6084.16s)]
*  No, that's true. Did you run into hunter biden in ukraine? I never did I heard I heard his footsteps around but I never saw [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6089.5199999999995s)]
*  What was he doing there? Did you know at the time? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6096.32s)]
*  Well, joe biden was the link between the obama administration and the aniković administration [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6100.08s)]
*  And uh, and he joe biden was showing lots of interest in ukraine [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6108.16s)]
*  and uh [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6114.32s)]
*  And [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6117.04s)]
*  I actually negotiated with [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6118.88s)]
*  with his people [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6121.12s)]
*  uh the the [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6123.28s)]
*  De-armament the removal of all nuclear fission materials in ukraine as part of the world conference that was trying to collect all the [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6125.36s)]
*  fissures fission materials from from the form of soviet republics and uh [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6133.6s)]
*  But there was always more interest [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6140.400000000001s)]
*  In ukraine from some of his people which I attributed to [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6144.4800000000005s)]
*  Hunter, although I didn't know it was actually hunter [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6148.72s)]
*  But some of the people who was partners vis [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6152.32s)]
*  In doing business in ukraine [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6155.5199999999995s)]
*  and [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6157.84s)]
*  I didn't do any business in ukraine other than politics. I specifically didn't because ukraine [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6158.88s)]
*  Is it's it's a corrupt country not one side or the other. It's a corrupt country. It has a soviet mentality [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6165.28s)]
*  It's getting better [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6173.12s)]
*  But it's still it's not good [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6174.64s)]
*  And so I felt that if I wanted to have the influence to help bring ukraine into the into the west [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6177.76s)]
*  If I wanted to do the kind of policy things that I that got me involved in ukraine in the first place [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6184.24s)]
*  That I shouldn't do business even though I could have done business [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6189.6s)]
*  I was about to say it must have been tempting you must have the energy deals coming across your desk all the time [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6192.56s)]
*  I can't imagine the kinds of deals and and big money fast money and I said no to all of that [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6196.64s)]
*  and uh [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6203.04s)]
*  Because I knew that would undercut me [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6204.16s)]
*  And the reason that they had trouble when they went after when weissman when muller went after me [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6206.96s)]
*  Finding something to stick me with is because they kicked over every rock they could in ukraine and they didn't find one single thing [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6211.599999999999s)]
*  um and [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6219.679999999999s)]
*  And so I thought it was untoward that hunter's firm [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6222.8s)]

*  Because of two things number one [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6361.84s)]
*  He was the candidate of kuchma and the establishment in 2004 when yushchenko won the election or purportedly won the election [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6364.08s)]
*  and then [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6374.0s)]
*  in 2011 [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6375.5199999999995s)]
*  after he was elected president [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6377.839999999999s)]
*  He did something which I [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6379.839999999999s)]
*  Vigorously told him he shouldn't do [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6381.839999999999s)]
*  Which was he arrested his opponent the political opponent [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6384.879999999999s)]
*  uh [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6389.44s)]
*  Julia timoshenko [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6391.44s)]
*  For corruption when she was prime minister that even yushchenko [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6393.12s)]
*  Acknowledged was corruption and and thought that the indictment was appropriate [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6398.139999999999s)]
*  Of of timoshenko well timoshenko was part of the albright merkel clinton [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6402.639999999999s)]
*  You know click [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6408.8s)]
*  and they [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6410.24s)]
*  Because she was female [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6411.679999999999s)]
*  Well, that was one way to define them [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6413.12s)]
*  um and uh [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6415.84s)]
*  and they [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6417.84s)]
*  Took great umbrage to yanukovych doing that even though [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6420.08s)]
*  He made his case, you know, you know very factually wait. So so he made hillary clinton [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6424.24s)]
*  Mad [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6431.84s)]
*  And that's why he got [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6433.04s)]
*  overthrown [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6435.28s)]
*  Yeah, effectively. Well, yes effectively because if he had not done that [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6436.48s)]
*  If he had not indicted timoshenko [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6441.36s)]
*  I think [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6443.84s)]
*  Which would have been the right thing not to do we shouldn't have done it [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6445.28s)]
*  Not from a legal standpoint, but from a geopolitical standpoint and given the history of yanukovych [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6448.8s)]
*  It was better as trump did with hillary clinton to not lock her up [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6455.92s)]
*  Yanukovych should have just moved on and not locked up to mishanko [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6461.04s)]
*  How many foreign leaders did hillary clinton kill or overthrow because they annoyed her? [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6465.68s)]
*  I don't know that [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6470.96s)]
*  I've never tallied that up [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6472.32s)]
*  But you really think that that that was the key mistake he made [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6474.96s)]
*  That's what turned the west against him in the west mishanko had been a man and not friends with hillary [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6478.48s)]
*  Would it have been different different outcome? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6483.92s)]
*  Probably probably that's scary what you're describing [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6487.26s)]
*  but [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6491.5199999999995s)]
*  So she's part of the girls club, so she can't be arrested for corruption. Well [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6492.88s)]
*  What I mean it wasn't defined that way but but in effect the point is [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6496.64s)]
*  Ironically timoshenko was the russian candidate for precedent against yanukovych [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6502.14s)]
*  Which is what was the cause of the corruption right and uh, and yet the west [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6507.92s)]
*  Blamed yanukovych [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6513.84s)]
*  And accused him of being the russian candidate [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6515.68s)]
*  Uh, and so [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6518.400000000001s)]
*  I mean i'm sure putin was just laughing in the kremlin at the machiavellian way [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6519.92s)]
*  He was manipulating the west in this little game [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6524.16s)]
*  But [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6529.84s)]
*  that was [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6531.04s)]
*  the critical mistake yanukovych made as president that [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6532.400000000001s)]
*  affected a series of events that [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6536.46s)]
*  We now are still dealing with today in ukraine [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6540.08s)]
*  It sounds like the u.s [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6543.04s)]
*  Government was just so way up into the internal affairs of this country like if this country had no sovereignty. It doesn't still are [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6545.04s)]
*  Well, of course. Well now [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6552.16s)]
*  Do are you worried that this? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6554.0s)]
*  War if it continues could lead to a global conflict or nuclear war no why because I think it's going to be resolved [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6556.16s)]
*  I I don't think anybody over there wants a global [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6562.5599999999995s)]
*  nuclear war including putin [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6566.0s)]
*  um [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6568.8s)]
*  I mean putin right now [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6570.24s)]
*  Is living a good life. I mean in the sense that his economy is stronger than it's ever been [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6572.32s)]
*  Paul maniford we destroyed the russian economy with sanctions. I don't know if you've read that we totally destroyed it. Well [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6578.48s)]
*  trump had [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6584.24s)]
*  Put the pressure on and biden undid it all [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6585.76s)]
*  And uh, I mean when trump came became president [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6588.8s)]
*  He shut down nordstream 2 which was the pipeline that was going to be the solution for germany to become partners with the [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6592.0s)]
*  Energy sector in russia [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6598.879999999999s)]
*  uh, and uh, and he put sanctions on [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6601.28s)]
*  uh on [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6604.5599999999995s)]
*  On some sanctions economic sanctions on putin for things he was doing that were causing problems [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6606.32s)]
*  and as a result putin [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6612.5599999999995s)]
*  backed off of everything [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6614.639999999999s)]
*  and was [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6616.32s)]
*  a [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6618.16s)]
*  An active player but not an aggressive player, you know, it was a nationalist leader of russia [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6621.36s)]
*  Uh, it was when [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6627.52s)]
*  Trump left office that putin became the aggressive leader. He was under obama [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6629.360000000001s)]
*  That led him to taking cremier under obama and with the same cast of players [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6635.04s)]
*  Now in charge of u.m force policy u.s foreign policy under biden harris. He saw the opportunity to finish the job [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6639.92s)]
*  and that's what and when afghanistan happened and nato became the uh, [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6646.8s)]
*  the the crazy thing that biden said [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6652.160000000001s)]
*  Uh was the basic goal of the for the u.s policy for ukraine. That was all he needed those two things the afghanistan debacle [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6655.839999999999s)]
*  and uh [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6664.639999999999s)]
*  And the nato threat to justify going back going into finished a job [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6665.679999999999s)]
*  Uh with policy blunder after policy blunder with no [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6670.88s)]
*  Forethought of what it might mean [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6675.5s)]
*  I mean even the polls were not pressing for ukraine to be in nato at that time [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6678.24s)]
*  And they're the front line after after ukraine, you know dealing with russia [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6684.24s)]
*  um [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6689.12s)]
*  it's so [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6691.04s)]
*  Biden his administration was filled with unforced errors in foreign policy [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6692.639999999999s)]
*  You know, tony blinken. How would you describe him? [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6697.2s)]
*  Weak. He's a staff guy [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6699.839999999999s)]
*  Tony blinken is a staff guy who in the old, you know organization book the peter principle by dr [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6701.679999999999s)]
*  Peter you rise up to your level of incompetence [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6707.28s)]
*  Well, he's risen to beyond his level of incompetence as has jake sullivan and several of the other people [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6710.259999999999s)]
*  They seem like midgets [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6716.34s)]
*  Okay, they seem like midgets their staff their staff who now have policy making they have no creativity. No strategic thinking [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6717.94s)]
*  and uh, and so [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6725.94s)]
*  You get a lot of inconsistent things based on what paper crosses the desk [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6728.179999999999s)]
*  and then when you have somebody like biden who [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6732.179999999999s)]
*  Was not in his best health in his during jesus president [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6735.3s)]
*  And who when he wasn't his best health according to people like robert gates never made a foreign policy decision that was right [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6740.0199999999995s)]
*  Uh, it compounded the the dangers that the blinkens of the world could do [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6746.259999999999s)]
*  And we're seeing the the world is a mess because of it. It certainly is [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6751.7s)]
*  um [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6756.179999999999s)]
*  second to last question do you [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6757.62s)]
*  You hear people say that [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6760.9s)]
*  Kicking russia at a swift the sanctions all accelerated the demise of the u.s. Dollar. Do you think that's? [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6762.74s)]
*  Imminent no [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6769.78s)]
*  Why I mean first of all [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6771.86s)]
*  There's no competition to the u.s. Dollar [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6774.42s)]
*  I mean the rmb is less than one percent of foreign trade [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6777.139999999999s)]
*  You know, and they're the biggest economy in the world. Yeah [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6780.66s)]
*  uh russia [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6783.38s)]
*  Because the economy is is not at all unimpactful against the third world economy the euro as a uh as a european [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6784.98s)]
*  Currency has value [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6793.38s)]
*  um, but there are too many [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6795.78s)]
*  Leaders of the european union to ever have a consistent foreign policy economic policy [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6797.86s)]
*  So there's really no competition look what bricks has been chinese been trying to do with the bricks organization [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6803.78s)]
*  in trying to get a [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6809.219999999999s)]
*  some kind of digital currency that could be a [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6811.3s)]
*  Replacement for the dollar in foreign exchange in foreign trade [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6815.2s)]
*  It's failing miserably [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6818.74s)]
*  because at the end of the day [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6820.66s)]
*  Nobody wants to hold [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6822.98s)]
*  The weak currencies in their treasury as part of the foreign trade system [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6825.46s)]
*  So it's never going to work and uh, and so [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6830.34s)]
*  And this is what trump is very smart on he trump saying, okay crypto world. This is this is the future economic policy [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6834.34s)]
*  Potentially of the world. Well, we need to have the fort knocks of bitcoin sitting in the united states not in beijing [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6841.76s)]
*  Uh, you know, and so what happens when trump makes that statement on the campaign trail [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6849.62s)]
*  Where he says he's going to have a crypto foreign reserve [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6854.26s)]
*  Uh, yeah in the in the united states biden immediately sells off 20 of its bit of the u.s's bitcoin [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6858.26s)]
*  Uh that so it's holding and guess who buys it [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6865.3s)]
*  china [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6868.66s)]
*  It's so but china in a bit biden in an attempt to distinguish himself from trump's [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6870.58s)]
*  Foreign new economic policy for the u.s [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6875.7s)]
*  Makes china stronger in the process [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6879.780000000001s)]
*  That's the kind of mentality that we deal with [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6882.900000000001s)]
*  Uh, you know in this administration [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6885.780000000001s)]
*  but trump understands that having [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6888.740000000001s)]
*  Crypto-regulated [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6891.92s)]
*  Having having a reserve currency here, you know will make it become a u.s [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6893.22s)]
*  based [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6898.8s)]
*  economic [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6900.26s)]
*  Structure [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6902.320000000001s)]
*  And therefore like the dollar can become part of the economic power of the u.s worldwide [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6903.78s)]
*  So again trump is seeing around the corner ahead of people's vision [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6910.66s)]
*  And is not seeing [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6915.86s)]
*  You know the blockchain the blockchain is the most transparent thing you could have [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6917.78s)]
*  Uh, you know, so if you're worrying about money laundering and things like that [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6922.179999999999s)]
*  There's so many ways to you know, uncover money laundering in the crypto world [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6926.34s)]
*  It's got to be regulated so things are set up the right way [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6931.62s)]
*  Trump sees that he doesn't know what the right ways are but he knows he knows conceptually [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6934.74s)]
*  Making the potential future economic [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6940.259999999999s)]
*  Uh mech means of world transactions a non u.s [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6944.099999999999s)]
*  Structure is probably not good. No, probably not good [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6950.34s)]
*  Probably the end of something big [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6954.34s)]
*  Okay, my final question you've run all these campaigns your whole life in the final week [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6956.18s)]
*  What are the markers the measurements that the rest of us can look at to determine who's going to win? [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6963.38s)]
*  Publicly available information. Well, the problem is publicly available information may not be publicly correct [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6970.5s)]
*  By design so is that true? Okay. So let me assess that to what extent are [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6977.780000000001s)]
*  Public polls manipulated to sway public opinion [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6982.82s)]
*  Well, it's not just public polls be manipulated [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6986.259999999999s)]
*  It's how they're interpreted because what happens is people don't know how to read polls people know how to read two things [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6988.5s)]
*  Who's the first place and who's in second place? So the in a ballot who's winning? [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6994.339999999999s)]
*  That's all they know how to do and when you have a race that is arguably close [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=6998.58s)]
*  Um, and you have one side who may be losing having all of the main means to communicate a different message [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7004.099999999999s)]
*  It's hard for american people who don't pay attention beyond what they see in morning or night at news of what it means [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7012.259999999999s)]
*  Um, I have no doubt in my mind that the media until election day [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7020.0199999999995s)]
*  Will say that harris is going to win [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7025.7s)]
*  Or is leading or can win is it going to win? [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7028.0199999999995s)]
*  Um, I think what will be signs of what's happening. Why would they say that do you think? [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7032.5s)]
*  because [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7038.099999999999s)]
*  By defining things they're hoping to make it correct. Yeah [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7039.78s)]
*  And it affects turnout it affects, you know, uh, for example it affects motivations [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7043.54s)]
*  um [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7049.54s)]
*  Right now the public data shows trump winning all seven battleground states [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7051.46s)]
*  That's that's an improvement over the last two weeks [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7056.82s)]
*  Everybody recognizes that the movement is towards trump [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7060.98s)]
*  Yet you've got the media saying because they need a hook that harris's new campaign strategy of just saying that [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7064.5s)]
*  Trump is unhinged unstable and unsafe [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7071.62s)]
*  Is going to change the the the trajectory and the undecided vote is going to break for trump. Well, why would they why would that happen? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7075.139999999999s)]
*  There's nothing to say why it would happen other than the media saying it's going to happen because harris is saying it [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7083.54s)]
*  There is no evidence that indicates that that message is working with undecideds if you look at the data [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7089.06s)]
*  Because they're saying what's important to them is their life has gotten worse [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7096.34s)]
*  They're not better off than four years ago. They think trump is better on economic policy for them personally [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7100.9s)]
*  They think trump is better for them safety wise. They think trump is better for them to uh, to secure the border [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7106.9s)]
*  And they're saying these are the most important issues, but we're going to vote against trump because he's unsafe and unhinged [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7114.26s)]
*  That's a campaign message that's not a direction of things are going the media provides the campaign message for harris now [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7123.7s)]
*  So that's why I mean what I mean when I say it's going to be hard to interpret unless the public polling [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7130.66s)]
*  starts to grow [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7137.86s)]
*  Meaning the the two percent starts to be three and four percent for trump and in states and the four percents become five or six [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7140.5s)]
*  Now interestingly [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7147.86s)]
*  You didn't see any national polls this weekend [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7149.7s)]
*  Why? [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7152.82s)]
*  I don't know. Well, maybe because the last two weeks the national polls [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7154.259999999999s)]
*  And the state polls were all showing movement to trump [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7159.38s)]
*  And so [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7164.66s)]
*  Therefore they take a week off and then things start to change again [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7165.86s)]
*  Now if you're in the polling business now is a weird time to take off [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7172.259999999999s)]
*  I mean there was not one but it's the super bowl. I mean, I mean, I think there'll be some polls [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7176.339999999999s)]
*  They're going to do polling this week. And then if the things are opening up for trump the way I think they they will start to show [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7181.299999999999s)]
*  Uh, they'll have to start tempering their statements a little bit [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7188.339999999999s)]
*  but [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7192.259999999999s)]
*  You're not going to be able to tell [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7193.219999999999s)]
*  If [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7196.74s)]
*  It's the race is close enough that there's not going to be like with reagan carter [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7198.58s)]
*  There's not going to be something out there that says it's over. We've got [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7202.98s)]
*  1984 not 1980 when it would do in reagan 149 states [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7207.12s)]
*  um [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7212.099999999999s)]
*  So I think what you watch for is incremental changes in the ballot [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7213.139999999999s)]
*  But it'll be hard because everybody's methodology is different. So you'll have [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7218.0199999999995s)]
*  You know a race where chumps down [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7222.58s)]
*  One point in place and up three points in the same place in a different poll [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7224.98s)]
*  So you're going to be confused. Are there any polls that you think are consistently more accurate than others? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7229.7s)]
*  ours [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7235.54s)]
*  But they're not public. Um [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7237.139999999999s)]
*  I think [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7239.78s)]
*  Most likely what's going to be important going into the last week is the uh [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7242.9s)]
*  The [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7249.139999999999s)]
*  rhetoric of harris [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7250.82s)]
*  If if there's no discussion of economic issues, then she knows she's lost [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7253.0599999999995s)]
*  Because that's going to be the deciding vote at the last minute [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7258.58s)]
*  But I think just watching the trend of some of the public polls will give you some sense of things [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7261.46s)]
*  Paul maniford, I sure appreciate you taking all this time. Thank you [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7269.219999999999s)]
*  You [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7272.18s)]
*  So it turns out that youtube is suppressing our show I know [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7276.42s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year with everything at stake google would be putting its thumb on the scale and preventing you from hearing [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7281.68s)]
*  Anything that the people in charge don't want you to hear but it turns out it's happening [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7290.1s)]
*  So what can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7294.42s)]
*  That's a waste of time [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7296.9800000000005s)]
*  Not in charge of google or we could find a way around it a way that you could actually get information that's true [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7298.34s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNd5CCejk0&t=7305.3s)]
