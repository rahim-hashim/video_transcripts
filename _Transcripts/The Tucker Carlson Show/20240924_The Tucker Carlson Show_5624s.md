# Alex Jones & Jack Posobiec The Trump Bounty, Oprah & Diddy, and Why War Makes Kamala Happy
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo)
*  I'm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, I am legitimately glad to be here [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4.44s)]
*  Thank you [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=12.44s)]
*  Well, it is a great country [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=16.52s)]
*  And thank you for saying that that has been this is our 12th city [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=20.04s)]
*  and out of 16 and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=24.84s)]
*  One of the things that I wanted I love you too. Thank you. I wanted [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=27.84s)]
*  You know if you spend your life experiencing the United States through your phone, which I think all of us do [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=35.2s)]
*  You really lose track of what it's actually like and you do [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=40.4s)]
*  And I do think that part of the lie part of the plan for the rest of us is to convince us that our country sucks [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  And that's not true at all. And that's why it's been such a blessing [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  To go coast to coast 830 this morning. I was on the Conestoga River in your state [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=57.2s)]
*  Beautiful you could have been anywhere Montana New Zealand. It was incredible and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=63.32s)]
*  I ran into people in the park where I was looming not in a threatening way, but you know wandering around one of your parks and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=67.76s)]
*  And they said to me, oh my gosh, we saw Alex Jones wandering in the park [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=74.28s)]
*  Actually, and they weren't afraid [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=79.28s)]
*  They were delighted [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=82.56s)]
*  And they were great people and that's kind of the point is that in 12 cities from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=84.16s)]
*  East Coast to West Coast to the middle to back to the East Coast. I haven't met a single angry person [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=90.2s)]
*  I haven't met a single nasty person. I haven't met anybody [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=96.6s)]
*  Mistreating anybody else I met exactly the opposite. I have met the warmest kindest most loving [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  hilarious [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=108.2s)]
*  Eccentric [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=110.28s)]
*  People I've ever met and those are the people I grew up with this is the country I remember and so no it's true though [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=112.84s)]
*  It actually is great and I've just been reminded of that. So thank you and thank you for having me [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  So with that said and I've been in a good mood and despite being away from my wife and dogs [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=127.36s)]
*  I've been in a good mood every day for the last 21 days [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=132.6s)]
*  Really until today when I got back from wandering around one of your parks [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=136.16s)]
*  And I see this picture of your governor [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=140.56s)]
*  You know, I don't I actually don't really want to show up in somebody else's state like attack their politicians because it's not my state [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=148.72s)]
*  or Commonwealth [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  But I saw a photograph of your governor Josh Shapiro standing with a foreign leader [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=157.28s)]
*  Signing an artillery shell [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=164.52s)]
*  That is going to kill civilians in a country. We're not at war with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=168.36s)]
*  With the grin on his face and I had a couple of thoughts. I was disgusted by it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=172.72s)]
*  Actually, I was enraged by it and here's why let me be specific about here's why [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  The first reason is, you know, I've been driving around Pennsylvania and actually I've fished here a lot over the course of my life [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=183.08s)]
*  And so I know the state [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=189.28s)]
*  Pretty well and there are some I mean, it's really one of the prettiest out of 50 maybe the prettiest in spots out of 50 [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=191.28s)]
*  It's ridiculous how pretty it is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=198.04s)]
*  But there are some hurting places in this state like hurting like actually [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=200.6s)]
*  Where people don't have jobs where you know, beautiful buildings in utter disrepair [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=205.84s)]
*  Walking back from dinner last night people sleeping on the sidewalk [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=210.84s)]
*  You know things that we should not put up with in a country with self-respect and our leaders don't have jobs [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=214.16s)]
*  self-respect and our leaders did that actually and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=219.72s)]
*  So for anybody in charge of anything in this country and particularly in this state [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=222.88s)]
*  To be spending time money or concern on a foreign country's problems enraged me it enraged me [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=228.36s)]
*  How dare you [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=237.36s)]
*  Lecture me about problems in some other place whether it's in Eastern Europe or the Middle East or I don't Central Africa [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=239.56s)]
*  I don't care. I don't wish any of those people harm at all. I wish everyone well [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=246.64s)]
*  But for you to spend your time worrying about that and paying for that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=251.84s)]
*  when your own state [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=257.24s)]
*  People in your own state are literally living on the sidewalk damn you actually I thought that I mean that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=259.68s)]
*  Because a leader a leaders [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=268.44s)]
*  Only job is to take care of the people he leads [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=271.88s)]
*  Period [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=276.68s)]
*  It's not to end global climate change. It's not to defeat Vladimir Putin or anybody else [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=278.04s)]
*  It's to protect and watch over the people he leads [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  This is true of any organization starting with the most basic organization [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=289.36s)]
*  in any society, which is the family a father's job is to watch over his family and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=296.0s)]
*  If his kids are sick [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=302.44s)]
*  And have drug problems and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=305.2s)]
*  He takes off to another country to deal with other people's children in a faraway land [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=308.68s)]
*  he has abandoned his family and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=314.24s)]
*  I don't care what story he tells you about himself and what a great and caring and compassionate person he is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=317.68s)]
*  And I don't care how much he attacks you for noticing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=324.48s)]
*  He is a bad father and a bad man [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=328.28s)]
*  Because he has violated his sacred duty to his own children [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=332.36s)]
*  That's why he's here is to watch over his children. The same is true for all organizations [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  Whether it's a military unit or the office you work in or the town you live in or the state you reside in or the nation [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=343.48s)]
*  You were born in the people who run and have one job and that's to watch out for you because they're your leaders and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=349.88s)]
*  When they ignore that they are evil [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=357.48s)]
*  Period they're not misguided. There's no way [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=360.8s)]
*  That someone who lives in this state particularly who claims to represent this state was born in this state. I'm one of you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=365.32s)]
*  I'm from Pennsylvania [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  you don't notice that there's you take a city like the one I woke up in this morning where my wife went to grade school and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a beautiful city built over centuries by hard-working immigrants by the way [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=381.64000000000004s)]
*  German mostly but probably from lots of other places and they spent hundreds of years [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=387.2s)]
*  Making this a great city and I walked through it this morning on the way to the park and the streets are covered in garbage [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=391.52s)]
*  And broken needles and so you don't notice that really Josh. You don't notice that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  How can you not notice that there's someone sleeping right there and you're lecturing me about Ukraine [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=403.42s)]
*  Damn you [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=409.24s)]
*  There's no concern at all and where there's no concern [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=411.24s)]
*  There's no love actually concern grows from love. It's organic [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=415.04s)]
*  It's easy you didn't have to read a book about how to love your children. It came naturally to you [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=420.8s)]
*  They're your children and by the way, that's enough. I [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=426.68s)]
*  Know I know I'm one of them, you know, not super well-educated [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  Non-geniuses we have a lot of dumb parents who are pretty good parents [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=435.68s)]
*  Not because they learn some theory about parenting from the Harvard School of parenting [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  But because they love their children and if you love your children you may make a mistake here and there I have [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=444.08s)]
*  Every parent has but over time if your actions are guided by a sincere love for your child [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=452.16s)]
*  That child's gonna be okay because that's all that matters [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  And so if over time you totally ignore [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=463.68s)]
*  the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=469.92s)]
*  Material and spiritual condition of your people if they wind up sleeping on the street and the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  Storefronts are closed and the windows are broken and they can't walk to CBS without getting mugged and it's physically unclean [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=476.8s)]
*  That's not an accident [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=484.92s)]
*  They don't love you they hate you that is true [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=487.08000000000004s)]
*  Do not listen I talk for a living so I think a lot about this [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=491.48s)]
*  About words and their use and I use words. We all do to communicate with other people [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  It's what separates us from the animals. It's not the opposable thumb. Whoever thought of that as an idiot [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  It's language. It's language is the ability to be precise about the way we feel [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=505.12s)]
*  And communicate that to another person to pass on information to pass on our history. That's what our culture is. It's talking and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=510.24s)]
*  That's great [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=517.64s)]
*  But words are also if you think about it a means of deception. They are a vector for lying [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=519.16s)]
*  How do the lies reach you because they come out of somebody's mouth [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=524.88s)]
*  So if you're in my business and you think a lot about language and you're around people who are lying for a living [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=528.2s)]
*  You're lying to yourself [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=533.72s)]
*  If you're in my business and you think a lot about language and you're around people who are lying for a living after a while [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=535.76s)]
*  You lose faith in it you do and after a while at least if you're me you decide, you know [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=541.08s)]
*  I'm gonna be a lot more like my dog [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=546.1600000000001s)]
*  My dog is not a fluent English speaker [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=548.96s)]
*  genius, but [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=552.2s)]
*  Doesn't speak English and yet my dog and your dog and everyone's dog knows exactly what's up [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=553.84s)]
*  They can't hear a word you say they only watch you and when you move over and pick up the bowl [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=559.64s)]
*  It's dinnertime. You didn't tell him that they're watching what you do and I've decided that's a much more accurate way to judge intent [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=564.6s)]
*  You can say well, I have a plan because I'm so compassionate. I really care about you and all your communities [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=571.96s)]
*  First of all, anyone uses the word community is lying to you [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=579.64s)]
*  Because there's no such thing as a community. There are only people actually with names and fingerprints [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  There are only individuals. No woman ever gave birth to a community. There's no such thing [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=589.52s)]
*  Talking about communities as a way of ignoring actual people really name three people in the community [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=595.0s)]
*  What are their middle names? Who are their moms? Do you know their moms? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=600.2s)]

*  It's not a bunch of dollars or no, they're a bunch of big substantial brick buildings built over a hundred years by people who cared [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=650.4000000000001s)]
*  And to see a town like that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=657.6s)]

*  And [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=885.84s)]
*  That's the other thing that enraged me and I didn't expect [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=888.0400000000001s)]
*  To give a speech like this because I'm really trying to cool the temperature and remind all of us that we're all Americans [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=893.1600000000001s)]

*  Signing an artillery shell. He's never seen one go up. I have and [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=908.4s)]

*  Moving to a nicer part of my town or like a bigger house at the other end of the street [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1936.74s)]
*  Like you never I don't have any dreams of like being up on stage with tucker carlson or any of this stuff, you know [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1942.34s)]
*  and [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1948.34s)]
*  It was the town of town where you know, my family comes from poland as I mentioned and we've been in narrostown for 100 plus years [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1949.3799999999999s)]
*  And every single member of my family was baptized at the same church until my son jack jack who's sitting out there jack jack [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1956.74s)]
*  Not too many video games [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1963.22s)]
*  And [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1966.26s)]
*  Uh, we had the same church [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1967.54s)]
*  We pretty much lived in the same block [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1968.98s)]
*  I grew up in the same house that my father grew up in when he was a little boy because that's what you did [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1970.34s)]
*  And the children that I played with were the kids of the children that my father played with and his father before [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1974.82s)]
*  And your whole world was a couple of blocks and that's pretty and everybody knew everybody and it was good [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1981.14s)]
*  It wasn't the nicest place in the world. It wasn't the most fantastic [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1986.5s)]
*  Nobody was ever writing, you know songs about it or anything, but it was a good place [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1989.46s)]
*  We're honest hard-working people could make a living could go go home and make enough for their families [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1993.14s)]
*  And then go home and maybe catch an eagles game after not after work [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=1999.46s)]
*  I mean, I think you've described what most people want actually most people don't dream of having helicopters they [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2005.86s)]
*  Dream of living where they grew up with the people they went to high school with walking distance from their grandparents graves [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2012.82s)]
*  That's not too much to ask is it my grandmom lived at the other end of the street so we could go over her house [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2018.42s)]
*  To go swimming. Uh, the school was within walking distance. It was all right there and [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2023.62s)]
*  The library was in walking distance and I used to go down to the library and read a lot [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2029.54s)]
*  And my my mom would let me go by myself when I got a little bit older [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2034.74s)]
*  But then she stopped letting me go to the to the library by myself [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2038.74s)]
*  When the homeless people that kept being led in were stabbing each other in there [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2042.66s)]
*  And this is montgomery county public library go look it up that [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2047.38s)]
*  It's this became a place for transients and vagrants [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2050.98s)]
*  And then all of a sudden during the 1990s section 8 started coming in and all the other federal programs started coming in [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2054.58s)]
*  And then oh, yes, narstown got turned into a sanctuary city [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2061.54s)]
*  So after that we got all the illegals that flooded over [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2067.06s)]
*  Destroyed the health care system because they go where they go to the emergency room for their health care [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2071.22s)]
*  so I actually wrote a uh, like a letter to the editor in the paper saying [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2076.2599999999998s)]
*  We shouldn't do this because it's going in like, you know end of the 90s [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2081.06s)]
*  You know some I don't even know how old I was and I said we shouldn't do this because this is going to overload [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2085.14s)]
*  And overwhelm our health care system [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2089.62s)]
*  And as I just mentioned the hospital that I was born in is now a vacant lot next to a planned parenthood clinic [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2091.7799999999997s)]
*  And that's and look look that's whatever that's my story, but that's that's not a unique story talking [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2100.66s)]
*  No, it's not and i'm sure most of the people in this room [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2105.62s)]
*  Either live through something like this or know people who live something like this and and what i've come to learn what I have come [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2109.38s)]
*  to learn that it's by politicians like josh shapiro [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2114.58s)]
*  And politicians like joe biden from scranton and all the others who have done this to us tucker [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2117.7000000000003s)]
*  This was being this was done by design people were taken for granted their lives were destroyed their communities were destroyed [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2122.98s)]
*  And I do not have any explanation for it other than they serve death and they hate the people they're supposed to represent [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2128.5800000000004s)]
*  Can I you know what strikes me about what you're saying and it is such a familiar story [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2136.5800000000004s)]
*  Particularly in this state. I I have noticed all over the state, you know east to west [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2141.52s)]
*  Is how fast it happened? I mean you're not 70 years old [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2147.94s)]
*  So you're saying you lived multiple generations of your family in the same town all went to the same church [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2151.38s)]
*  And then in like 10 years, it's all gone [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2157.38s)]
*  It was so fast and and as a kid, you know, it was it was kind of shocking and you know [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2160.5800000000004s)]
*  Look my parents when they when they moved this out, they they wanted to keep us safe [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2164.34s)]
*  You know your your you know [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2167.54s)]
*  It starts with your bike getting stolen and then your next bike gets stolen and then your third bike gets stolen [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2168.82s)]
*  And you know, this was a town where you know, it's it's idyllic, you know, it's kind of the cliche but you could [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2174.1s)]
*  Leave your leave your door unlocked, you know [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2180.98s)]
*  And your babysitters were like the girls who lived next door that was a little bit older [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2182.8199999999997s)]
*  And then when you went out to play mom never said, you know, oh i'm worried about you know [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2186.9s)]
*  Because you knew your neighbors and so your neighbors would say, oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2190.42s)]
*  He's here and you know [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2193.54s)]
*  Make sure you go home because it's going to be night time and then you go out and then and that's how it was [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2194.58s)]
*  And suddenly within that lifetime and I know my my two boys are like sitting right there [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2199.2999999999997s)]
*  That jackjack and aj [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2203.62s)]
*  I've never even taken them down the street where I grew up. Why? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2206.02s)]
*  Because i'm worried they would be shot [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2210.3399999999997s)]
*  Because that's how bad the gang violence has gotten there in the time since [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2213.38s)]
*  The the open murderers that take place there all the time the illegals that that are selling drugs all over the place [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2216.9s)]
*  We had we had like like a couple of jamaicans that were behind us [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2222.58s)]
*  You know that were drug dealers and they would keep rottweilers out to keep people away and they kept getting arrested [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2225.46s)]
*  But then every time they got arrested [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2229.7799999999997s)]
*  They would they would something strange would happen talker because they would come back after they got arrested [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2231.62s)]
*  And so when you're little you think oh, you know the cops are the good guys and they can take away the bad guys [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2236.18s)]
*  and so [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2240.5s)]
*  You you wonder wait a minute [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2241.62s)]
*  Why don't the police just come and get rid of all these bad guys and wait a minute [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2243.14s)]
*  I think there's some bad guys over there and some bad guys over here and and suddenly you realize that all of the [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2246.18s)]
*  Standards of living and the quality of life and these basic suppositions that you have about the way the social contract is supposed to work [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2252.98s)]
*  Actually don't seem to work sometimes and it turns out the leaders aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing and suddenly [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2258.66s)]
*  The towns are being completely destroyed and you don't understand and as a kid you don't understand even now [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2264.5s)]
*  I'm still kind of asking questions. Why did that happen? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2270.02s)]
*  But I did realize one thing tucker. I did realize one thing and throughout all of whatever i've done [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2272.34s)]

*  And even if you try which by the way right in the state butler pa, you know [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2341.46s)]
*  Where they tried to take out donald trump on stage funny how it is that josh shapiro doesn't seem interested in that investigation [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2345.14s)]
*  doesn't seem interested in finding out who fired that bullet or why and didn't provide the [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2352.34s)]

*  Incompetence or is it complicity? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2373.7s)]
*  We hear a lot from viewers about big tech censorship and those reports are more frequent than ever right now censorship meaning [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2376.58s)]
*  Shutting down your access to information not lies or misinformation, but true things. It's only the truth that they censor [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2384.5s)]
*  Facts that get in the way of the lies are trying to tell you the net effect of this of course [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2392.82s)]
*  Is interfering in the 2024 presidential elections? That's why they're censoring more than ever now because the stakes are even higher [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2398.02s)]
*  You're probably not shocked by this but the specific examples of it do throw you back a little bit [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2404.34s)]
*  We've seen screenshots in videos showing how we google search learn more about the attempted assassination on donald trump [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2410.1s)]
*  Instead push users to information on harry truman or bob marley or the pope [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2416.9s)]
*  Anything other than the relevant truth, which is that they just shot trump in the face [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2422.1s)]
*  They don't want you to know that because it might help trump [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2428.18s)]
*  We've seen examples where facebook marked true photos of a bloodied and defiant trump as misleading [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2430.9s)]
*  Somehow those pictures were a lie and then limited their visibility [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2436.58s)]
*  Its ai assistant explicitly denied the shooting ever took place. This is insanity [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2440.18s)]
*  But it's at the core of big tech's editorial policy [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2444.1s)]
*  Which is denying the truth to you in order to control the outcome of this presidential election. That's not democracy [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2447.06s)]
*  We've seen examples where a generic search for information about donald trump was automatically [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2453.46s)]
*  Re-phrased to show positive stories about kamala harris instead. Is there any clear example of election interference? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2458.1600000000003s)]

*  And we said we're gonna write an entire book about it in like a month, which we did we read a snap book about it [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2595.78s)]
*  called bulletproof [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2601.86s)]

*  He came from ukraine where he was a foreign fighter over there who had received training [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2621.14s)]
*  And then used that training to come here to this country to try to kill [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2627.22s)]
*  The one person who's trying to stop all of the things that we just talked about from happening and he said in order to do so [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2632.18s)]
*  It is morally correct. He said it's morally correct. And then the doj this morning [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2641.06s)]
*  puts out a letter [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2646.82s)]

*  There's a bounty on trump's head for [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2658.34s)]
*  150,000 dollars and the doj of course put this out on purpose. They could have put that under seal [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2663.04s)]
*  They could have redacted how many things the government redacted tucker they could have redacted that they didn't well the nashville shooting [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2667.54s)]
*  We just got two years later the national shooting which which they fought tooth and nail to give us the the [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2672.7400000000002s)]
*  Manifesto of which was like oh, I hate christians and I hate white people. So i'm going to kill christian white people [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2678.16s)]

*  So what we've decided to do with this it started as a book [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2693.7000000000003s)]
*  We're launching our own investigation into what went on and we've hired a private investigative firm [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2698.5s)]
*  and some of whom are actually in the crowd today, it's just fyi and [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2703.86s)]
*  We are going to be expanding that investigation from bethel park to butler down to west palm beach all the way out to hawaii tucker [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2708.34s)]
*  We're going to go to greek rain if we have to we are going to get to the bottom of what happened [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2716.58s)]
*  We're calling it the bulletproof project because I just don't trust any of these people [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2720.74s)]
*  I don't trust any of these people be careful in ukraine [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2724.1s)]
*  I may not go personally again over there [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2728.1s)]
*  But um the the one thing that we have learned tucker is this this bounty the 150 000 dollars [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2730.1s)]

*  Five assassination teams three of which have foreign ties. I think we know one of them already [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2755.14s)]
*  And and then two of which are domestic [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=2759.46s)]

*  um [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3492.42s)]
*  And I but I ask you this you never give me a straight answer [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3493.7s)]
*  But since there are thousands of people watching maybe you will now what's it like to be vindicated on everything? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3495.9399999999996s)]
*  Well [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3505.62s)]
*  I mean it's scary because [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3507.22s)]
*  I mean I realized that with a lot of power was a lot of responsibility [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3509.2999999999997s)]
*  And a lot of times with the media i'll joke around satire wise and i'll see it the cover of the new york times [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3512.8199999999997s)]
*  And clearly people aren't seeing the video i'm saying it's a joke like jones wants to kill his neighbors [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3517.8599999999997s)]
*  No, I said there's a nuclear war we all collapse [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3522.1s)]
*  And my kids are starving around a horrible food. I will eat the liberal neighbors. Not my conservative ones [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3525.06s)]
*  It's more of a it's more of a joke [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3529.7s)]
*  But so so when people take what I say so serious, I I joke a lot less [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3531.7799999999997s)]
*  I used to joke a lot, but now I I you know, the the show is is not [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3536.5s)]
*  It used to be like half comedy because I like to have fun [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3540.74s)]
*  So i've taken really serious now because I realize they twist everything so it's a lot of responsibility, but I also wish [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3543.46s)]
*  I was making predictions [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3549.14s)]
*  with the proviso [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3550.82s)]
*  That if you call the white house and tell them don't fly planes the world trade center and and then bring in the police state [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3552.42s)]
*  And then invade the muslim countries to bring them in here [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3557.54s)]
*  Uh, you know not even go after radical islam if you do all [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3560.42s)]
*  I was saying if you call the white house tell them don't do it [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3563.86s)]
*  They may not do it but of course I have a big enough audience people didn't believe me [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3566.1s)]
*  So we couldn't stop them so I make these predictions about probable futures because I can see all the evidence pointing towards it [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3569.54s)]
*  So that we can stop it [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3576.26s)]
*  But but now the good news with elon and you and so many others that are fully awake and reaching a lot more people that I ever [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3577.7000000000003s)]
*  Did folks are are are really waking up and their knowledge curve is going parabolic right now [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3582.5800000000004s)]
*  So we're in the driver's seat, but that makes the globalist very dangerous and the empire is going to strike back [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3587.7000000000003s)]
*  How [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3595.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, they always love to pre-program it so claus swab is a cyber attack will make covet look like a minor inconvenience [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3597.2200000000003s)]
*  Kind of a russian accent of a german [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3604.76s)]
*  Of course, you eat the bugs and you will love it. But these are real quotes [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3607.32s)]
*  You we don't need too many people in the future to polish the robots. These are these are real quotes [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3611.5600000000004s)]
*  Uh, you've all know harari. Oh the future is not human. You're just obsolete [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3618.1200000000003s)]
*  We're going to be the gods. I don't believe in god now [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3623.2400000000002s)]
*  He said but i'll be the god of the clouds ray cursewell at google. He says I don't believe in god yet [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3625.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to become a god but to do that [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3630.28s)]
*  All you folks just want to be good decent people and live a good life and you know experience god's great creation and love god [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3633.1600000000003s)]
*  You need to be gotten out of the way for the rise of their new uber mentioned superman [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3639.0800000000004s)]
*  So we're right back to all of that and that's why you have the official plan of depopulation by the un down to 500 million [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3644.28s)]
*  That's an 80 plus percent reduction. That's official. That was on the georgia guide stones in georgia till somebody blew it up, but [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3651.2400000000002s)]
*  Nobody got hurt. Thank god [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3657.88s)]
*  So the agenda is your garbage you're just a consumer [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3659.96s)]
*  You're like weevils in the in the pantry eating their their their flower or something [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3664.12s)]
*  And you just have to be gotten rid of because you don't fit into their beautiful magic [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3668.92s)]
*  Wonderful plan. I was watching the day most group. You know, they have meetings all the time at their world government summit about a year ago [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3673.64s)]
*  When elon came on via video link and he said listen people don't want your world government. It centralizes things [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3679.56s)]
*  It's tyranny people are rejecting you [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3685.4s)]
*  We need diversity of countries and sovereignty and peoples like firewalls in a building or bulkheads in a ship [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3687.56s)]
*  but but in some of the other meetings they had these globals and they're going [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3694.04s)]
*  We're just doing something so beautiful what we're bringing them. I don't know why they're opposing us and don't trust us [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3698.04s)]
*  Well, because you just want to depopulate us because you're selfish demonic pigs who love the raw power of destroying people [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3703.24s)]
*  Because america for all its faults was the best house in a bad neighborhood and the whole world [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3710.84s)]
*  The whole world for a hundred and two hundred plus years, but really the last hundred aspired to come here [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3716.44s)]
*  Aspired to have our freedom and the globalists can't have this country exist and have their horrible global [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3722.04s)]
*  technocracy slave plantation ai system in charge if there's a place that's still free and open compared everywhere else [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3728.42s)]
*  So we've got to be brought down and used to bring tyranny to the world while we're being destroyed and while we're paying for it [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3735.64s)]
*  So the whole world turns against us and we collapse and so the idea of america is [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3742.44s)]
*  discredited so that other people around the world don't ever try to go the path of our republic which is diametrically opposed to their [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3747.54s)]
*  globalist satanic death cult and that's why they're attacking america [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3754.98s)]
*  It's the idea and the spirit that is incompatible with their global slave state [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3759.88s)]
*  The most interesting and newsworthy television show of the year is coming here to tcn. We are not bragging. That's actually true [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3766.36s)]
*  So our longtime producer justin wells and a team have been embedded with no publicity at all [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3779.64s)]
*  With donald trump on the campaign trail for months. They're the only crew capturing what is going on on the campaign in real time [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3784.76s)]
*  Intimately they're with trump as he campaigns for the presidency across the country and they've shot some amazing [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3793.22s)]
*  Footage that shows you what it's really like in there [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3799.64s)]
*  So if you're a member you will soon be able to get this docu series covering the historic campaign the fall of joe biden [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3801.3999999999996s)]
*  Never before seen footage from the assassination attempt at the butler township, pennsylvania trump rally and a lot more [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3807.3999999999996s)]
*  It's going to pull back the curtain completely. They are embedded inside the campaign. I can't wait to see it personally [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3813.24s)]
*  But to get it first go to tucker carlson.com become a member [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3819.4s)]
*  The greatest television event of the year we're proud to offer it [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3823.56s)]
*  I would make fun of you except every word is true [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3834.52s)]
*  the the thing that I can't get past is [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3838.04s)]
*  To put the destruction of other human beings as a goal [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3842.2000000000003s)]
*  Is not a that's not a human desire like animals don't commit genocide actually [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3847.48s)]
*  That's not natural. That's not natural at all. Like there may be people in your way and you're a bad person and you kill them but the idea of [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3852.68s)]
*  desiring to kill huge numbers of people [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3860.28s)]
*  Like that can only be supernatural [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3864.7599999999998s)]
*  it feels like [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3867.4s)]
*  And that's what the bible tells us is there's an outside force [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3869.16s)]
*  Putting powerful people in positions to carry this out to keep humanity from reaching its potential destiny [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3872.52s)]
*  And and and god gave us free will and so there's the tester there [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3878.76s)]
*  and so that is the [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3882.6800000000003s)]
*  mission and and the existence of satan whether you believe that's a real thing because I know it is or an archetype regardless it's there and if you read [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3884.6000000000004s)]
*  the robber barons 120 years ago and and and the social darwinism [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3893.2400000000002s)]
*  That came out of it they wrote books and said when we do evil bad things and kill people en masse [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3898.04s)]
*  We are the apex predator. We're doing them a favor to make them stronger [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3903.16s)]
*  So it's really just eugenics [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3907.64s)]
*  But at the end of the day you study the globalist [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3909.0s)]
*  They're not just trying to kill the weak and the infirm and the low iq which is you're not supposed to do as a human [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3911.16s)]
*  Made the image of god you're supposed to build up the weak [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3915.96s)]
*  Christ said suffer the little children what you do to the least of me you've done to me better for you to have a millstone [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3918.36s)]
*  Try to run it on the ocean, but the globalist put fluoride in the water for everybody [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3922.92s)]
*  They're they hate the smartest and the best and and and the freest because it competes with them [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3927.8s)]
*  And so they're trying to stop their competition [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3934.36s)]
*  Those people that love god have free will because we're much stronger and more powerful than them [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3937.1600000000003s)]
*  But we don't seek power in every moment. They're thinking if we wake up and take back control of our destiny [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3941.88s)]
*  It's over for them [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3947.1600000000003s)]
*  So that's why they hit us with the 5g and the gmo and and all the garbage and the glibestakes in their own [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3948.12s)]
*  Documents is to stun us and poison us so that they can dominate us not because they're strong [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3954.42s)]
*  But because they're weak [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3961.24s)]
*  That's totally right [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3965.48s)]
*  That's totally well, that's why they've set up the fake economy in the united states. This town was built on manufacturing men making things [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3967.08s)]
*  With their hands and that's been replaced by lending money and interest and selling the same piece of ground over and over and over [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3975.56s)]
*  real estate [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3982.84s)]
*  and [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3984.52s)]
*  They hate strength. They hate strong men above all [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3985.72s)]
*  Obviously, I was talking to someone the other day who's not conservative who said to me off camera [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3991.22s)]
*  You know the chemicals in our water, for example are changing the sex of frogs [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=3995.96s)]
*  And I didn't want to be mean I didn't want to be mean but I did say [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4001.48s)]
*  Are you telling me they're turning the frogs gay? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4005.96s)]
*  And this person didn't get the reference at all and goes yeah, that's basically right [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4010.36s)]
*  Everything you've said about the chemical poisoning of the human body [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4016.44s)]
*  Is now just kind of accepted like is it weird to see science? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4021.24s)]
*  Catch up to you. Well, I mean look what happened and I knew what they were doing [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4025.48s)]
*  This is like 15 years ago [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4029.7999999999997s)]
*  I did like an hour-long analysis from South African University and a university in Japan a university [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4031.7999999999997s)]
*  Of I think rice in Houston and the University of Berkeley in California that just a little bit of atrazine [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4037.96s)]
*  Would bend the gender of almost all the frogs sterilize a lot of them and turn a large portion of them [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4044.3599999999997s)]
*  Where they would try to have sex with males and confuse them so much in their development [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4049.16s)]
*  As embryos floating around in the Krieger pond [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4054.2799999999997s)]
*  And so I did all that science and then I said listen this isn't about hating gay people or something [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4056.6s)]

*  And that'll break up the family and then the kids that do live will control about a state [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4178.360000000001s)]
*  But everybody else will abort the kids because there's too many people and we'll all be dead by 1987 at current rates [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4182.6s)]
*  It's malphusian. None of it was true like al gore saying by 2017 all the ice caps would melt. They're bigger than ever [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4187.64s)]

*  They're public so almost everything I say is from these dirtbag scumbags [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4203.96s)]
*  I mean you go watch you go read the world economic forum. They say no humans by 2045 only cyborgs [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4209.88s)]
*  The future is not human [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4216.36s)]
*  Listen, I remember reading in scientific publications [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4218.44s)]
*  When I was first getting on there 30 years ago because there's almost no shows like mine then so I was on a bunch of radio [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4222.12s)]
*  Stations, you've got a local station figured out a syndicate called syndicator. You know said hey, can I get on they put me on a bunch [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4227.4s)]
*  of stations and [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4233.48s)]
*  Boom i'm reading and then people are sending me stuff [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4235.24s)]
*  So I had like mit quarterly coming to me saying we've made the first humanized mice that are part mice apart mice part human [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4237.8s)]
*  We've made the first goats that are [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4244.2s)]
*  Part spider that create body armor, but we don't show the public these facilities that would freak them out too much [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4246.5199999999995s)]
*  That's 30 years ago [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4251.4s)]
*  Now you hear about the humanized mice that are part human or salmon that are part grasshopper that grow twice as fast [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4252.92s)]
*  And kill all the real normal salmon and just folks [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4258.36s)]
*  Tucker talks about aliens and absolutely stuff going on the globalists are making aliens by [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4262.68s)]
*  Mixing humans and other animals and insects and plants and then they put them they chestate them and use cow uteruses [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4268.92s)]
*  to grow them [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4276.839999999999s)]
*  This is going on everywhere. So it's like a breakaway [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4278.5199999999995s)]
*  whole civilization [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4281.24s)]
*  That's separate from us the globalists have with life extension technologies and cures to cancer and parkinsons, but instead of [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4283.24s)]
*  Giving us all the cures they're keeping that for themselves and they're just getting ready to wipe all us out [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4290.36s)]
*  So we don't even have access to that whether you think of it as moral or not [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4295.32s)]
*  But they even had people didn't believe me when I talked about it when I was reading the documents because we weren't on tv then [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4298.92s)]
*  I'm reading this on air and people are thinking that they weren't all getting mit quarterly. Did mit about seven years ago. Look this up [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4303.16s)]
*  Humanoid hybrid chimeras are gestating [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4311.0599999999995s)]
*  At facilities across the united states and it goes on to say part pig part human part cow part human [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4315.639999999999s)]
*  So they won't be rejected by the cows that are growing them. They then harvest the organs [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4322.36s)]
*  They harvest the stem cells and they've got facilities now with thousands of cows per facility with humanoids [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4326.28s)]
*  Growing in them and this is in the literature and they don't like me because I go here's the literature [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4333.0s)]
*  But they won't let you on the basis and and let me let me tell you with the spider goats 25 years ago [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4337.96s)]
*  I call up one of the places in new york where they've got spider goats that are part spider [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4343.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, and they're milk makes body armor and I get the head guy a private contractor in the pentagon. He's happy like he comes on [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4348.5199999999995s)]
*  Two days later. He calls back. He goes the pentagon's really mad. I would they didn't tell me it was classified [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4356.36s)]
*  They're gonna kill me if you don't take that that take down that interview [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4361.08s)]
*  Okay, so you're hearing all this look up spider goats 30 year old stuff [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4364.12s)]
*  Okay [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4368.76s)]
*  All of this so as good as i'll tell you stuff is it's it's also bad because there's a breakaway civilization [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4369.72s)]
*  That's really in like the year 2045 according to their estimates. They've already got way more advanced ai [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4376.28s)]
*  Everything else but they they can't get full control the human population yet [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4381.88s)]
*  Because in an hour if we wanted to tear up all the equipment and the ai systems and shut it down we could it's not [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4386.2s)]
*  That it's bad in of itself. It's how it's being deployed against us [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4392.12s)]
*  That's why they've got to get rid of the farms and the ranches and and the gardens and people knowing how to build things [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4395.719999999999s)]
*  And do things they've got to make us obsolete first [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4401.4s)]
*  And then they're going to release the real bio weapons that kill the majority of people [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4404.44s)]
*  That's why covid was just a drill they admit it was to get us locked down [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4408.12s)]
*  So they release the real bio weapon you just stay at home and die like you're supposed to but we're not going to do it [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4412.2s)]
*  And if they release the big bio weapon, we know who to go after bill gates [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4417.24s)]
*  We'll get you in your bunker [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4421.639999999999s)]
*  And suckerberg will bring you to justice legally and lawfully through the court system [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4423.88s)]
*  Well, you completely freaked me out. I gotta say [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4429.639999999999s)]

*  Everything I just told you is not even hidden [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4437.8s)]
*  You're gonna be like what human clones for 30 years spliced with animals and I mean and they're splicing humans with fish [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4439.8s)]
*  With lizards everything else. It's all public. Well, so that's why it freaks me out because I know you're telling the truth [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4445.4s)]
*  Um, i'm still stuck on the spider. We've been drinking spider milk [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4450.5199999999995s)]
*  No, they've got they've got goats that are only like, you know al gore used to talk about that [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4454.92s)]
*  He would say we have the orb spiders [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4459.4s)]
*  Yeah, they've got look up spider goats. They've got goats [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4462.04s)]

*  So you gotta wonder why people I mean [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4486.12s)]
*  People are doing this but the truth is american taxpayers are paying for it [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=4490.52s)]

*  People would say people would say how is it that so many of our world leaders have gone to an island such as that? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5156.46s)]
*  Right, they say how could this have happened? How could it be such an open secret? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5162.14s)]
*  And then when it happens people come out and bill gates again, by the way, and suddenly people say we all knew we all knew [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5164.860000000001s)]
*  There was stuff about jeff. What do you mean? You all knew about this? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5169.42s)]
*  What do you mean you knew about this kind of stuff and you realize we're looking at it backwards? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5171.900000000001s)]
*  In order to become a world leader [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5176.62s)]
*  You have to go to the islands in order to become a celebrity you have to go to the ditty party [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5179.66s)]
*  This is the way their system works. It's a right of initiation [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5186.54s)]
*  Absolutely, and that's what i've explained just like different mafias. You have to kill somebody so they have dirt on you [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5191.64s)]
*  They know they're going to be videotaped doing illegal things so they can get in the gang [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5197.02s)]
*  It is the initiation. Yeah, there once was a guy who actually infiltrated a certain initiation place called the bohemian grove [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5201.58s)]
*  Yeah [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5210.14s)]
*  Maybe well the point is it old-fashioned time with the republicans. That was the way to compromise them like well [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5211.34s)]
*  Hey, you want to join this particular republican club? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5216.860000000001s)]
*  You know you got to do this and ronald reagan and nixon refused that's well known [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5219.18s)]
*  But but but that's because that's how you get republicans. Hey, we'll tell your constituents you're sucking [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5222.9400000000005s)]
*  You know what but but but but for the democrats and some republicans like haskard it's like hey [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5227.9800000000005s)]
*  You know that girl at that party she was 16 [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5234.3s)]
*  Next it's going there with that 12 year old girl or you're not in the club and the next it's like [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5236.54s)]
*  You know that eight-year-old go in there a strangle or we're going to kill you and that and i'll tell you they're not just raping kids [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5240.700000000001s)]
*  At epstein island and stuff and I was I talked about it 15 years ago. It's first talk about it [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5247.34s)]
*  They're killing kids. Ladies and gentlemen, so so so they're only talking about 15 year old girls [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5250.9400000000005s)]
*  They kill them [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5256.22s)]
*  so so can I can I just ask you to assess my my [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5258.06s)]
*  My last question to you alex jones is [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5262.700000000001s)]
*  I'm not really sure how kamala harris became [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5267.900000000001s)]
*  The democratic nominee went in like one day from being someone everybody made fun of to being the most [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5272.22s)]
*  heroic figure in human history [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5278.700000000001s)]
*  I'm still kind of bewildered by it [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5280.9400000000005s)]
*  But I would be interested in your take on kamala harris [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5283.18s)]
*  Who is kamala harris and how'd she get here? That's a great question. Well kamala harris [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5286.620000000001s)]
*  Got the same amount of votes in the primaries as ronald mcdonald, which is zero [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5291.5s)]
*  Kamala harris [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5297.26s)]
*  Uh is a is a soulless truly [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5299.0199999999995s)]
*  empty flesh bag [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5303.18s)]
*  Who was admittedly a sex operative just like oprah wimfrey meant that she was an underage sex slave [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5305.5s)]
*  And then i'm looking up it's all true. You can find oprah giving the girls two winestain [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5312.38s)]
*  Yeah, but see the pictures and oprah's admitted and she's a victim of it a lot of the victims of it become the victimizers [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5317.18s)]
*  She said that she was an underage prostitute. I think it was in chicago, but but [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5323.1s)]
*  Today's the question. It's clear that kamala harris was a political sex operative willy browns talked about it all of it [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5326.46s)]
*  And then she was so soulless and would put innocent people in prison know they were innocent on death row [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5333.18s)]
*  Uh, do you know home invasions looking for legal guns saying she'd do it then when when she was the attorney general [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5338.860000000001s)]
*  She would put pro lifers that exposed the illegal [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5346.22s)]
*  Killing of babies right at nine months when they were already born in the selling of their organs including still beating baby hearts [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5349.42s)]
*  She would put the journalists in jail for many years. That's her famous cases [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5356.22s)]
*  So the system has has seen her has passed her around [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5359.58s)]
*  They know she's super stupid [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5363.9s)]
*  And and and they can bring her in like biden and then blame everything that bad happens on her [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5366.3s)]
*  And so she is the greatest example [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5371.9800000000005s)]
*  Of a mindless puppet that they want to put in to further demoralize us to think that that's america [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5374.3s)]
*  To make america a further joke around the world [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5380.3s)]
*  But then so that's who kamala harris is a clear and present danger and a meat puppet [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5383.02s)]
*  Is pennsylvania gonna vote for kamala harris? [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5388.54s)]
*  Alex is pennsylvania gonna vote for kamala harris [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5395.820000000001s)]
*  Look if we had a free and fair election it'd be like reagan in 86. We eat trump will get 49 states [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5399.18s)]
*  Uh, but because of the mass fraud in in in states the democrats once democrats can control your voting system [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5405.74s)]
*  You know since the 90s, it's very hard to turn it back [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5411.9s)]
*  Uh, I know pennsylvania's tried to tighten up some things and texas has taken millions of you know, dead people and legals off the voting [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5414.7s)]
*  Roles and so is nevada's taking hundreds of thousands off. So look the evidence is a long story, but [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5421.58s)]
*  Trump won a landslide in 2016 [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5427.9800000000005s)]
*  barely won [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5430.62s)]
*  People thought he was invincible and oh he's gonna win no problem in [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5432.3s)]
*  2000 so he barely won so they were able to steal it [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5437.32s)]
*  He's gonna have a bigger landslide in 42 days than he did in 2016 [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5440.14s)]
*  that's [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5445.1s)]
*  That's why they've tried to kill [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5446.38s)]
*  Him twice now and probably more times for being told we don't know about [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5448.9400000000005s)]
*  so if [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5453.58s)]
*  If he was losing the assassination attempts would be unnecessary [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5455.66s)]
*  That's why the assassinations attempts are happening. That's why there's five kill teams [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5460.3s)]
*  So so what and i'll let you take us out on this on a note of hope which I [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5463.9s)]
*  What you said you gave advice for what the what children should be doing what should the [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5471.1s)]
*  People in this room be doing what should be their attitude? [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5476.78s)]
*  Not just for the next 42 days, but for the next year and what can people do? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5480.54s)]
*  Okay. Well, I never claimed to be some saint or you know, tell me what other lives i'm definitely not perfect [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5485.42s)]
*  But i'll tell you what i've been doing since I was at least 18 years old and I became a christian before that [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5491.26s)]
*  But it was it was it was like i'm a christian, but I really wasn't truly born again [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5496.14s)]
*  You got to get on your knees [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5500.38s)]
*  In the morning before or in the middle of the night or whenever you wake up [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5502.7s)]
*  You got to get on your knees. You got to tell god I can't do this [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5505.66s)]
*  I need you I need you to come into me and take control and leave god and direct me and tell me what to do [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5509.419999999999s)]
*  and you've got to [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5517.339999999999s)]
*  And you've got to change your values [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5519.259999999999s)]
*  To where you don't care what the world says or what the system says [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5521.98s)]
*  You care to do what what the conscience that god gave you that guardian angel that you know [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5526.46s)]
*  Is right there looking over your shoulder tells you to do and you've got to not be a coward and you've got to be strong [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5532.0599999999995s)]
*  And the minute you step across that point, you don't even have courage anymore [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5538.139999999999s)]
*  You're on a mission and you're not possessed by the holy spirit [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5542.379999999999s)]
*  But you let it in and it's now driving and in control and now you got god behind you [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5545.98s)]
*  And nobody can stand against us if god's with us [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5552.94s)]
*  Well, that is a hopeful note and I think that's true and with that [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5560.86s)]
*  Alex jones jack posobek i'm proud to be friends with both of you. Thank you tucker got a little gift for you guys [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8YTAg8WgQo&t=5564.9400000000005s)]
