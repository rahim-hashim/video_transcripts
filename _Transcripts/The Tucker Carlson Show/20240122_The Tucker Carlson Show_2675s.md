# Catturd on Trump's VP Pick, Animal Rescues, and Why He Hides His True Identity
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM)
*  If you don't pay close attention to Joe Biden, you're probably content to dismiss him as just a senile old fool [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=0.0s)]
*  who's exiting the stage at high speed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=6.0s)]
*  But if you actually listen to him, if you watch what Joe Biden says, it dawns on you, actually, this man is evil. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=9.0s)]
*  Actually evil. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=16.0s)]
*  Listen to what he says. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=17.0s)]
*  It's dishonest. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=19.0s)]
*  It's vicious. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=20.0s)]
*  It's cruel to his fellow Americans. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=21.0s)]
*  He's a bad person, and he's the president of the United States. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=24.0s)]
*  And yet no one seems to say that out loud or even notice. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=27.0s)]
*  Instead, our moral superiors, our overlords, are very exercised about, well, some people you've probably not even heard of. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=30.0s)]
*  People on the internet who are saying true things. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=39.0s)]
*  And one of the people who makes the maddest is a guy, really an account, called Cat Turd. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=42.0s)]
*  Yes, that's the name, one word, on ex-formerly Twitter. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=47.0s)]
*  Cat Turd has millions of followers and is remarkably, remarkably controversial for a person whose name has never been spoken in public. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=51.0s)]
*  He actually got into a fight with Adam Kinzinger, no less than Adam Kinzinger. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=61.0s)]
*  Speaking of evil, here's, in case you've forgotten it, here's what it looked like. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=66.0s)]
*  Kinzinger made that clear the other day when he responded personally to a Twitter account called Cat Turd. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=70.0s)]
*  Because when you're one of Washington's leading authorities on foreign policy, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=75.0s)]
*  you spend a lot of time on Twitter reading accounts with names like Cat Turd. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=78.0s)]
*  So the other day, Cat Turd made the mistake of posting a meme that seemed to mock the colors of the Ukrainian flag. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=81.0s)]
*  Colors that are sacred to Adam Kinzinger and every other empathetic soccer mom-ometer from the mid-40s. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=87.0s)]
*  You can imagine how offensive that was. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=92.0s)]
*  It was like telling an off-color joke about Meghan Markle. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=95.0s)]
*  It could not stand. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=98.0s)]
*  And so alone and battling debilitating hot flashes in his kitchen, fighting the urge to open yet another bag of gypsahoy, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=100.0s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger fought back. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=106.0s)]
*  Literal evil, he wrote in a late night response to Cat Turd. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=108.0s)]
*  If I met you in person, it would not end well for you, sicko. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=113.0s)]
*  Whoa, hear that Cat Turd? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=118.0s)]
*  It will not end well for you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=121.0s)]
*  That's not a pillow fight Adam Kinzinger is talking about. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=124.0s)]
*  That's a full-on slap fight with hair pulling. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=127.0s)]
*  This is real. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=129.0s)]
*  You'd better apologize. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=131.0s)]
*  The heart goes out to Cat Turd tonight who's probably cowering in a litter box somewhere, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=133.0s)]
*  waiting for Adam Kinzinger to show up with sharpened nails. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=136.0s)]
*  So Cat Turd enraged Adam Kinzinger and has also been noticed on late night comedy shows. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=140.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=146.0s)]
*  And things seemed to hit a new low last night as he retweeted three times an account called Cat Turd. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=147.0s)]
*  Now to be fair, the cat is wearing glasses, so it must be smart. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=160.0s)]
*  The actual Twitter handle for the account is Cat Turd 2. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=166.0s)]
*  And I for one cannot wait to see what's in store from Cat Turd 3. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=171.0s)]
*  Cat Turd sounds like someone Joe Brydon would have brought up in a speech during the primaries. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=177.0s)]
*  When I was growing up in Scranton, there was a real mean son of a gun. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=182.0s)]
*  We used to call him Cat Turd. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=185.0s)]
*  He could do up and be bop like nobody's business. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=187.0s)]
*  What was I talking about? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=190.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, climate change. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=192.0s)]
*  Well there's a reason nobody watches late night comedy shows anymore, but still Cat Turd seems to offend people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=194.0s)]
*  Why is that? Who is this man? Who's Cat Turd 1? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=200.0s)]
*  Well we found him. He's a man. He's from the south. That's all we know. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=204.0s)]
*  He wants to keep his name private because he doesn't want his life any more disrupted than it already has been, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=208.0s)]
*  but he is joining us anyway in physical form. Cat Turd, it's great to see you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=212.0s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=216.0s)]
*  So... [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=217.0s)]
*  You've made it, Tucker. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=218.0s)]
*  So many questions. So many questions. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=219.0s)]
*  I actually don't know your real name, just for the record. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=222.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=225.0s)]
*  What year did you graduate from Yale? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=226.0s)]
*  Yeah, I graduated Yale I think 1984. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=229.0s)]
*  No, seriously. I'm guessing you didn't go to Yale and I mean that I went to Harvard after you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=232.0s)]
*  You went to Harvard. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=237.0s)]
*  I remember you so well there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=239.0s)]
*  What was your preparation for being Cat Turd? Tell us your life trajectory. Who are you without revealing your name? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=241.0s)]
*  Well, I'm from northwest Florida. I mean Georgia. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=248.0s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=252.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I live in northwest Florida now. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=253.0s)]
*  But so I graduated high school kind of early at 17, joined the Army. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=256.0s)]
*  I was telling you earlier I spent my 18th birthday in a foxhole in Fort Dix, New Jersey in basic training. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=261.0s)]
*  Back when it really was basic training. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=268.0s)]
*  And then I got injured when I was over in Bad Kitzingen, Germany and we were on alert and I hurt my back real bad and had surgery. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=271.0s)]
*  And that was pretty much the end of my Army career. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=280.0s)]
*  I was a medevac back to Fort Gordon, Georgia. Had back surgery. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=282.0s)]
*  I actually tried to stay in, but they wouldn't let me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=286.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=291.0s)]
*  I mean, it's been something I've had to deal with my whole life. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=292.0s)]
*  So they wrecked your body and then kicked you out? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=294.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=295.0s)]
*  Good. Okay. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=296.0s)]
*  You know, it was an honorable medical discharge. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=297.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so after that, I hitchhiked to Panama City and I've pretty much been in the panhandle ever since. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=300.0s)]
*  I'm 59 years old. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=308.0s)]
*  I spent, just like most people, I'm different than most of the influencers that do all the right things, have the kids, wear the suit and ties. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=310.0s)]
*  I pretty much was screwed up until I was about 40, 45 years old. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=323.0s)]
*  You were? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=328.0s)]
*  I had a couple of failed marriages followed by, I was just, I was a professional musician for a year. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=329.0s)]
*  I was a hippie. I had long hair and a beard and smoked weed and had a VW van. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=335.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=340.0s)]
*  And wore two-died shirts. I did. I did. I was a real hippie. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=341.0s)]
*  I went from job to job. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=344.0s)]
*  Partied a lot. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=347.0s)]
*  Yeah, partied a lot. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=348.0s)]
*  I partied a lot. I had my stint with drugs and alcohol. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=349.0s)]
*  I don't know why everybody's scared to admit it. Everybody paints this big famous picture. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=353.0s)]
*  This big picture of how, in the world that we live in today, it's just like, I've always been honest with my followers and on my podcast. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=358.0s)]
*  I don't trust people who don't know how weak they are. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=368.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=370.0s)]
*  And so I kind of aimlessly went through my life and then I finally ended up, you know, working a good fiber optics job for years. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=372.0s)]
*  At 54 years old, which was five years ago, I'd never been on social media. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=381.0s)]
*  I didn't know anything about social media. I didn't even know how it worked. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=388.0s)]
*  I had no friends on social media. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=390.0s)]
*  And I just decided to, I got arthritis in my fingers. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=392.0s)]
*  I couldn't play guitar anymore. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=397.0s)]
*  And I was just like, you know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to get on Twitter. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=398.0s)]
*  And I just, you know, saw the cat, just said cat turd. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=401.0s)]
*  I never thought I'd have 100 followers. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=405.0s)]
*  You know, who would think that it's just like, it's like Homer Simpson now, cat turds. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=407.0s)]
*  It's way beyond me, you know, they're doing. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=412.0s)]
*  Wait, if I could just ask you, what was the moment when you decided to make that your numb daguerre? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=414.0s)]
*  I just was like surfing through the web and I saw that cat picture and it just cat turd. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=422.0s)]
*  It was that simple. I mean, who, you know, I didn't think anybody was ever going to follow me. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=428.0s)]
*  I remember asking people for weeks, how do I post a picture on here? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=432.0s)]
*  And so I don't even know how it took off. It just got legs somehow and it just took off. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=436.0s)]
*  So, but why did you do it? Why did I do what? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=441.0s)]
*  Why'd you go online and start giving your opinions? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=444.0s)]
*  I don't know. Well, I've always been as a professional musician in the nineties. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=447.0s)]
*  You know, you have to be good at construction. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=454.0s)]
*  Construction? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=458.0s)]
*  Yeah, because you got to make money. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=459.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=461.0s)]
*  You're not going to make money. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=462.0s)]
*  I'm a little slow. I make that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=463.0s)]
*  So you better learn to build stuff. So, you know, me and my band guys, we were builders. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=465.0s)]
*  You know, we built decks, roofs, built a house, whatever. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=469.0s)]
*  And so in the nineties, you're bored and, you know, we played music at night. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=473.0s)]
*  We don't want to listen to music. So I started listening to Rush Limbaugh. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=478.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=481.0s)]
*  So every day we'd listen to Rush Limbaugh while we're building houses, whatever. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=482.0s)]
*  You and every construction crew in America. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=485.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it just, it just like, this is, I didn't even know I was a hippie. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=487.0s)]
*  I thought I was a liberal. I didn't know what I was still. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=491.0s)]
*  And I was like, this guy's saying everything I believe. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=494.0s)]
*  And it was, it was, you know, I listened to him to the day he died. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=498.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=504.0s)]
*  Yeah. Total Rush, baby. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=505.0s)]
*  And it was just like, this guy's talking exactly what I think. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=507.0s)]
*  And I never even knew what I was until, you know, I started listening to him. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=512.0s)]
*  But that's how I got in. And I was just a political junkie from the first time I heard him. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=516.0s)]
*  And it's just been like that ever since. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=521.0s)]
*  So I got on Twitter, now X, and just started posting. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=523.0s)]
*  And man, what a five years. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=528.0s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=531.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=532.0s)]
*  I mean, but why did you do that? I mean, a lot of people have political opinions, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=533.0s)]
*  but they don't imagine that other people want to read them or they don't feel compelled to share them with the world on a social media app. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=537.0s)]
*  I don't know why it caught fire. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=544.0s)]
*  But why did you want to do it? Because you were frustrated? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=546.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. I just, you know, I think as an artistic, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=549.0s)]
*  although I didn't play on stage a lot in the last years, I'd always go to my room and I wrote a lot of music. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=552.0s)]
*  I actually wrote my best stuff then. And it was just, I need that artistic outlet. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=558.0s)]
*  And when I lost that, I was really kind of depressed because I'd lost my fingers. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=563.0s)]
*  It was like overnight. They started swelling up. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=567.0s)]
*  I got arthritis from playing guitar and using power tools my whole life. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=569.0s)]
*  And I was just like, I just need to do something. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=574.0s)]
*  And so I just got on social media. It's just it's just the spur of the moment. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=578.0s)]
*  It was my birthday. It was like two days after my birthday. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=583.0s)]
*  I said, I'm going to join Twitter. And I was asking people, I was calling people, how do you join Twitter? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=586.0s)]
*  Well, how do you do a picture? Is there a membership committee? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=590.0s)]
*  Watch the rules. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=593.0s)]
*  So when at what point did it? I can't remember the first time I saw it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=596.0s)]
*  But at what point did you realize it was working? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=600.0s)]
*  I don't know. I remember after two or three months, I was I was working on a job in Miami. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=605.0s)]
*  And I told one of my friends that was that was rooming with me at the time we were working there. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=611.0s)]
*  I said, man, this thing's really taken off. And he thought I was crazy. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=616.0s)]
*  So what? I said, it's cat turd thing. And he's just he thought I was nuts. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=619.0s)]
*  You know, everybody did. I was trying to tell everybody these things really taken off. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=623.0s)]
*  And everybody just like, whatever. You know, here's the shovel. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=626.0s)]
*  Get the rocks over there. And it just it just caught fire. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=630.0s)]
*  I don't know how. I don't know how it did. And it just keeps going. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=635.0s)]
*  Wow. I mean, so you're in Miami rooming with another guy that you're working with. Yeah. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=639.0s)]
*  On some kind of job. Yeah. Yeah. Fiber optics job. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=645.0s)]
*  I did fiber optic construction for years after I got finished with my music career. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=649.0s)]
*  And like at the point that Adam Kinzinger starts replying to you and threatening your life. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=655.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. By the way, that would be quite a slap fight. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=661.0s)]
*  Do you feel confident? I don't know. You know, it's he's scary. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=664.0s)]
*  I want to see eye to eye with him. So I'm going to get a home depot, five gallon bucket and stand on it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=670.0s)]
*  But when Adam Kinzinger himself, oh, yeah, he's got a you know, he's got Ukraine to defend. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=677.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He's super busy. He cares about transitioning or whatever he's doing when he takes time to attack you and threaten to beat you up or scratch you. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=683.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like that wasn't my meme. I just said, I think I said I shouldn't be laughing at this, but it's funny. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=693.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then and then it made it worse. You know, once he does that, he don't understand how the Internet works. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=699.0s)]
*  Now they got his face on it. Yeah. You know, now all the time you see that meme, it's his face on it now. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=705.0s)]
*  Well, how do you understand how the Internet works? I don't know. I just somehow do. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=710.0s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. So what has it done to your life? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=715.0s)]
*  Well, it's totally changed my life. You know, financially, I started selling merch and then I got a podcast. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=719.0s)]
*  You know, we got Jules and I have a co-host, Jules Jones. Our podcast is called In the Litterbox. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=728.0s)]
*  You know, we got to deal with Rumble, which we love. We love Rumble. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=735.0s)]
*  And and then, you know, fast forward to these ad shares, which are crazy, you know, with Elon Musk. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=738.0s)]
*  I mean, it's big money. And I bought a new truck a couple of weeks ago. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=747.0s)]
*  I never had a new vehicle in my life, you know, and to be able to do something like that for me. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=753.0s)]
*  I mean, I think a lot of people I know what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck for most of my life. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=759.0s)]
*  I know what it's like to live like a tea bag, you know, at the end of the workday and be so sore. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=765.0s)]
*  I know what it's like to choose from your rent and food. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=769.0s)]
*  I know what it's like to ride around on four different tires. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=772.0s)]
*  One's got three plugs, one's got five plugs, one's got 13 plugs in it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=776.0s)]
*  You know, we call them baloney skins, no tread. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=781.0s)]
*  So I think I think a lot of people just I'm kind of like the Rudy Twitter. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=785.0s)]
*  I probably don't deserve to be there, but I worked hard enough to maybe get that one play at the end at the end of the game. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=791.0s)]
*  It's the most American story ever. It really is. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=798.0s)]
*  There's I don't think there's a lot of people like my situation because, like I said, most the influencers are I mean, they just they've they've and they did the right thing. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=803.0s)]
*  Not me. I did the wrong thing. They did the right thing. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=814.0s)]
*  They've got great wives and kids and, you know, they've made a lot of money that they got no parents that are successful and they went to college for sure. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=816.0s)]
*  And I'm just a working class stiff. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=825.0s)]
*  Well, that's the ruling class of the country. Yeah. And I'm from it. So I know. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=827.0s)]
*  I know. Yeah. So it's pretty amazing to see this happen to you. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=831.0s)]
*  It is. So how much of your day is spent on it? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=836.0s)]
*  Pretty much seven days a week. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=839.0s)]
*  I'm an insomniac. I always have been. So I get up at four or five and I basically do it seven days a week, 15 hours a day. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=842.0s)]
*  So but you're you spent your life moving physically moving outside. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=852.0s)]
*  Obviously, it's been hard on your body, as you said. Oh, it has. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=858.0s)]
*  But it's also there's something good about moving. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=862.0s)]
*  And I mean, what's it like the change at fifty five to go from, you know, being on the road installing fiber cable to sitting behind the screen all day? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=865.0s)]
*  Oh, it's fantastic. It's true. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=873.0s)]
*  Moving. No, but well, I'm sorry. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=877.0s)]
*  I've got, you know, I've got 13 rescue pets and I still, you know, I still take care of my I got a little I got a horse wrench, but there's no horses. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=884.0s)]
*  Got a barn and the whole deal. And it's fenced in where my dogs can run free and I chase them around all day. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=894.0s)]
*  Thirteen rescues. Yeah. Thirteen now. What's that like? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=901.0s)]
*  It's well, I post all the pictures online and it's all these beautiful pictures, but they don't see all the fights and the growling and, you know, there he's swallowing a bone and he swallowed a rope and they're all chasing a squirrel and they're fighting. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=905.0s)]
*  And, you know, they don't see all that. But it's it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=918.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened, but they just started coming to me. I've never been to a rescue shelter. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=921.0s)]
*  I found all of my pets starving and beaten and abandoned and just on the side of the road, all the dogs, except I got two puppies. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=928.0s)]
*  One of the dogs I got came in and she was young. I didn't think anything about it. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=938.0s)]
*  And she got pregnant and before I knew it, it was just like I had 10 puppies on top of this. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=944.0s)]
*  And it's funny because I gave them away and they got Twitter accounts. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=952.0s)]
*  They got huge Twitter accounts. People follow the puppies. They're called puppy turds. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=956.0s)]
*  Why do you adopt so many animals? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=962.0s)]
*  I just I mean, when you see a dog starving, what are you going to do? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=964.0s)]
*  And then I try to tell myself I'm going to rehome some of these. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=969.0s)]
*  And then you spend so much time with them trying to just like get them fed. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=973.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're so the ones I find they're so almost dead, starving to death. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=977.0s)]
*  So and then I fall in love with them. I can't let them go. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=984.0s)]
*  And that's that simple. Wow. That's I mean, that's pretty that's pretty amazing. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=987.0s)]
*  But I got to stop. Well, now you can afford the dog food. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=992.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I can. And, you know, it's just kind of turn in thing where people say, hey, cat turd, I got a rescue we found on the side of the road. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=997.0s)]
*  So I'll post it or I'll repost it. And it's just turned into something I do. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1007.0s)]
*  I've had kennels built and you got to keep them separated. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1011.0s)]
*  Some of them, you know, they're from some of them. I find they're 10 years old. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1014.0s)]
*  Some of them find their puppies and some of them just don't like each other. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1017.0s)]
*  Yeah, dogs are like that. Yeah, it's hard to get pack cohesion. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1021.0s)]
*  So you're not telling us your real name or taking your glasses off, which I respect. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1026.0s)]
*  But tell us why. Tell us why that would be a concern in a supposedly free country. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1031.0s)]
*  Yeah. So number one, I like being in the background. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1036.0s)]
*  I get invited to all the red carpet events and stuff, but I never go. It's just not my thing. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1040.0s)]
*  But I mean, for just saying my opinion and that's all I do. I just give my opinion. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1045.0s)]
*  I just like look at each issue and they call me a right wing fanatic on Wikipedia and all these hit pieces they do. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1051.0s)]
*  But, you know, I hate the Republican and Democrat Party equally. Me too. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1058.0s)]
*  I mean, we have a country now, 99 percent of Washington, D.C. is just corrupt. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1061.0s)]
*  And we're the resist. You're not the resist. You know, the people they online, we are the resist. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1067.0s)]
*  And we're just trying to fix the country. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1075.0s)]
*  So for doing my common sense of things, I get death threats. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1078.0s)]
*  I've been swatted three times. They try to have me murder. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1082.0s)]
*  Tell us. Well, tell us what that's like. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1084.0s)]
*  Well, it always usually happens during my podcast. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1087.0s)]
*  But so the last time they call and pretend to be me and they said that that I caught my wife in bed with somebody and I'm not married. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1090.0s)]
*  So and I shot them both. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1102.0s)]
*  And then when the police get there, I'm going to kill them. So they'll try to come up and get you. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1105.0s)]
*  They try to get you murdered. That's what it is. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1108.0s)]
*  It's attempted murder. If you ask me during your podcast, they're in the pot. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1110.0s)]
*  It's always during the podcast. It's happened to me three times. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1114.0s)]
*  It's happened to a lot of us. You know, it's happened to Marjorie Taylor Green, Tim Pool. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1117.0s)]
*  But once you know, everybody's once you get to a certain level, they're going to come after you. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1122.0s)]
*  I have they've lately they've been cutting heads off rabbits and throwing them off the body over my gate. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1128.0s)]
*  So that's happened three times now, too. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1135.0s)]
*  So we live in a country where the citizenry is surveilled much more thoroughly than North Korea surveils its own citizens. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1137.0s)]
*  Like everything you do is monitored right through your phone, facial recognition, satellites. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1146.0s)]
*  Everything is monitored, but they can't find the people who are doing this. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1151.0s)]
*  Yeah. And are they even interested in finding if it happens to us? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1156.0s)]
*  You know, who do we call? Who do you call? Who do you call? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1160.0s)]
*  Because there is nobody. Now, the local police where I live are awesome. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1163.0s)]
*  And I support the blue. I always have. I just don't support the feds at all. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1167.0s)]
*  I mean, look what they turned into. Tucker. It's awful. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1171.0s)]
*  So you call the local cops when this happens. And what do they say? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1175.0s)]
*  Well, the first time I did it, they were like, your cat turd. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1179.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, so I left them after the first time. I gave them a bunch of gear. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1184.0s)]
*  You know, here, it's got their stuff. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1188.0s)]
*  But they they actually come and they patrol my property a lot, mainly because it's a one horse town. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1191.0s)]
*  There's nothing else to do. Yeah. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1196.0s)]
*  But they're great. And then they watch it like a hawk. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1199.0s)]
*  You know, they're very protective of it. But it's like if somebody on the left annoys me, which they do a lot, I'll mute them. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1203.0s)]
*  Right. If I annoy people, which I understand I do, they try to have me killed. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1212.0s)]
*  I mean, that's a big gap, isn't it? Right. It's a big gap. Muting. Yeah. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1217.0s)]
*  Attempted murder. Big. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1221.0s)]
*  So you spend your life watching what's happening. Oh, yeah. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1225.0s)]
*  What conclusions have you drawn? Where do you think we're going this year? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1229.0s)]
*  Well, we're in trouble. I mean, it's just I always try to be positive, but sometimes I can't see a way out of it anymore. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1233.0s)]
*  Can you? I mean, I just don't see a way out of it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1240.0s)]
*  And I'm a Trump supporter. I'm a Trump guy. Yeah. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1243.0s)]
*  If you know, I go back to the it cracks me. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1246.0s)]
*  The funniest thing to me on X is all the people that do whatever the government says that put resist in their bio. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1249.0s)]
*  That's the funniest thing. Black Lives Matter. Obedient little bitches. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1256.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Whatever. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1261.0s)]
*  Whatever. And they can they can tell them anything and they'll do it. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1263.0s)]
*  What if you can convince your voters that men can have babies? Yeah. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1268.0s)]
*  Think about that. You've got them. You can tell them to wear a dirty diaper on their head and they're going to do it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1271.0s)]
*  They will. Well, they did, actually. If you don't have a dirty diaper on your head. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1278.0s)]
*  But once once they can convince you of that, I mean, you got to know these people are laughing when they're at the bar. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1284.0s)]
*  The Democrats say and then we've convinced them that men can have babies and they believe it and they're calling everybody names that doesn't believe it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1290.0s)]
*  So do you see that changing at all? I believe the woke is the woke part of it is coming to a head. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1297.0s)]
*  I really do. I think it's people are tired of it. I am. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1305.0s)]
*  And we don't care what names you call us. And I'm a person who believes I don't. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1308.0s)]
*  You know, I was a hippie. I was a real hippie. Not only fake hippies. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1312.0s)]
*  I was a real hippie. I mean, I lived up. I was homeless at one time. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1316.0s)]
*  I lived up in a tent in a lake for months. How was it? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1319.0s)]
*  It was good. I could call out a crappy and I ate them. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1323.0s)]
*  Every night, you had crappy every night. Oh, well, you got to get to eat somehow. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1328.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it's it's it's a it's a rough spot to be in. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1334.0s)]
*  But what were we talking about? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1340.0s)]
*  You're saying that people are getting sick of the anti white stuff, the trans stuff, all that. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1343.0s)]
*  But the kids have a chance. I mean, think think about this. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1348.0s)]
*  I'm 59. I think you're in your 50s. And we went to school. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1353.0s)]
*  There was, you know, we actually learned mathematics, social studies, history. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1357.0s)]
*  But they think about a kid these days. He goes to school. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1363.0s)]
*  They start when they're three or four in kindergarten and they don't have a chance. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1366.0s)]
*  They they look what they do to them. Now they're like critical race theory. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1371.0s)]
*  You get over there. Oh, you're a racist and you're OK. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1375.0s)]
*  You're a racist. And then they put a mask on you and they they they teach you that the air you breathe is poison. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1378.0s)]
*  And then they tell you you're all going to die and burn in hell fire from global warming in 12 years. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1385.0s)]
*  Think about these little kids, how scared they are. They scare the hell out of you. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1389.0s)]
*  And then it's trans this and they're showing BJ's to seven years old in books. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1393.0s)]
*  And then they go through the whole school and it's like that. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1401.0s)]
*  And then they step into college and wants college. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1404.0s)]
*  It's turbo now, you know, and they're brainwashed through. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1407.0s)]
*  And I honestly think the longer you stay in college, the dumber you get now. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1410.0s)]
*  I always any question about it. Does that make sense? Makes a lot of sense. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1415.0s)]
*  And so you have these teachers. So they go they go through that. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1419.0s)]
*  And then they go and they stay in college as long as they can to the 30 years old. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1423.0s)]
*  And then they go right from there to a teaching job. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1427.0s)]
*  So they stay on campus until they're 50. So they don't have any life experience. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1430.0s)]
*  They've never they don't know what it's like to to work for a living or run a business. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1434.0s)]
*  And they're the ones teaching, you know, and it's just it's horrible. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1439.0s)]
*  So they don't have a chance. So all of this or some of it is coming back. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1443.0s)]
*  Some of it is going to come to a head this calendar year because of the presidential election. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1448.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Where do you see that going? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1452.0s)]
*  Well, man, Trump's going to win the primary. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1455.0s)]
*  I hope everybody knows that we get him all around and fight each other and the dissent as people. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1460.0s)]
*  We're all I'm in there. We're all fighting each other. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1467.0s)]
*  But Trump's going to win the primary and he should win it. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1469.0s)]
*  But man, what they're doing to him and they're not they're not doing it to Trump to do it to Trump. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1473.0s)]
*  They hate him. But I always say on the podcast that Washington's OK, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1481.0s)]
*  as long as they have George Bush versus Obama every year. That's what they want. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1487.0s)]
*  They want George Bush versus Obama. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1493.0s)]
*  Every four years, they split up the four trillion dollars with their friends. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1495.0s)]
*  Some of them get it sometimes. Some of them get that. That's what they want. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1498.0s)]
*  They want Bush versus Obama. They're OK with that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1501.0s)]
*  They love Nikki Haley. Of course, you know. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1504.0s)]
*  Can I ask you to pause? Yeah. And since you're online all day, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1508.0s)]
*  do you think there's organic support for Nikki? There's none. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1512.0s)]
*  OK, because she's I'm not even sure she's an actual human being. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1515.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's the most dangerous Republican primary candidate we've had. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1518.0s)]
*  Probably one of them in my lifetime. Why do you say that? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1524.0s)]
*  She's just I mean, some of the things she said, like she's a neocon, number one. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1527.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, my God, how many times are you going to be food, America? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1531.0s)]
*  I mean, from the Vietnam War, Vietnam, North Vietnam, South Vietnam. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1536.0s)]
*  It's it's over for our country. Yeah. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1541.0s)]
*  So let's send 60,000 people to Korea was the same way. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1543.0s)]
*  All the Middle Eastern wars. And she she's right in there. Ukraine, Ukraine. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1547.0s)]
*  But unlike you, she served our country in uniform. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1553.0s)]
*  Oh, wait. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1555.0s)]
*  But but she's dangerous. And remember when she said a week ago, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1559.0s)]
*  if you're anonymous on Twitter, whatever, I want your name. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1563.0s)]
*  That's what she said. You got to register with the government to give you your name. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1567.0s)]
*  I want your name. Not the government wants it. I do. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1570.0s)]
*  Yeah. She's dangerous. I just I get a feel for people. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1574.0s)]
*  I've always had a knack knack to kind of fill people out. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1577.0s)]
*  And I just it's just she's like Mike Pence. Yeah. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1580.0s)]
*  She's nothing they say is authentic. Everything sounds like it's program cliches. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1584.0s)]
*  Yes. I've had a lot of bosses in my life and some nasty ones. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1590.0s)]
*  You know, that's the way bosses are. Yeah. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1594.0s)]
*  And every person I've ever talked to in my life and ever boss ever have, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1596.0s)]
*  they talk exactly like Trump. All of them. Yeah. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1600.0s)]
*  I don't have anybody in my life that sets up there like Mike Pence and, you know, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1603.0s)]
*  a bird in the hands worth two in the bush. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1608.0s)]
*  You know, just every cliche you can imagine. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1610.0s)]
*  Do you get a creepy vibe off Pence? Total. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1612.0s)]
*  I say on the podcast sometimes I don't know what's killed in these. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1615.0s)]
*  I'd hate to see what goes on there when the lights go out. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1619.0s)]
*  So nobody's that perfect. You know, quit acting perfect. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1624.0s)]
*  I remember that time he was like, I can't even have lunch with another woman [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1628.0s)]
*  because I'm married, even if we're friends. Remember he said that? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1631.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was like. Yeah, I had I had a lot of thoughts about that. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1634.0s)]
*  I mean, by the way, I think you should if you're married, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1637.0s)]
*  you should really actively try not to commit adultery. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1640.0s)]
*  I think that's I totally agree with that 100 percent. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1643.0s)]
*  But him specifically saying that I reached exactly the opposite conclusion. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1646.0s)]
*  I'm just going to say that. Yeah, I don't I don't I don't trust them when they're [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1650.0s)]
*  when they're that perfect. And it's all it's just like it's planned. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1654.0s)]
*  Everything they say is planned. And I just that that's why I like Trump. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1658.0s)]
*  You know, does Trump make some bad everybody? I don't believe everything you say. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1662.0s)]
*  You don't believe everything I say. I don't believe every Trump doesn't believe [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1666.0s)]
*  everything I say. But I mean, what they're doing now, he's already an iconic figure. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1669.0s)]
*  They're going to turn him into a martyr and they're making him more powerful [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1675.0s)]
*  and more powerful and more powerful. And I could see him if the election was fair. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1679.0s)]
*  I could see him just totally steamrolling. If it was fair, I know it would be. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1684.0s)]
*  You think it will be? Well, who do we have to fight? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1689.0s)]
*  Who do we have to fight? Ron McDaniels. Give me a break. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1696.0s)]
*  I mean, we got Scott Pressler out there beating the streets. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1699.0s)]
*  He's beating the street like a bicycle clown out there. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1702.0s)]
*  He is going around everywhere. He's registering voters on the ground. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1706.0s)]
*  And the Republican Party won't give him the time of day. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1709.0s)]
*  He knows every rule to every county in this country. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1712.0s)]
*  And that's if you could have a thousand of him out there and they train another thousand, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1715.0s)]
*  you could sweep this thing. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1720.0s)]
*  Why do you think they're not doing that? Well, why would you have someone as mediocre [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1723.0s)]
*  and incapable as Ron McDaniels with no track record of success in any area? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1728.0s)]
*  Why would she run the Republican Party? That's pretty weird. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1733.0s)]
*  I have no idea. I remember when 90 percent of the people were complaining about her [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1735.0s)]
*  getting the job again. I remember one of the donors said, yeah, this has nothing to do with y'all. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1741.0s)]
*  The donors picked this. I remember reading a story like that. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1747.0s)]
*  That sounds true. It's true. They don't care. They don't care about us. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1751.0s)]
*  I mean, I always say, especially when it comes to Trump, the Democrats will cheat [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1756.0s)]
*  and the Republicans will let him because they hate Trump. Yeah, they hate him. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1761.0s)]
*  And I mean, it's a simple choice to me. I mean, if you're really he's the only resist president in my lifetime. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1765.0s)]
*  Why do you think they hate him so much? Because he's not a part of their club. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1772.0s)]
*  This is not about Trump to me. It's just like this is an outsider and we're going to destroy his life. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1777.0s)]
*  And we're going to show everybody out there that if you pick an outsider, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1785.0s)]
*  somebody that we hadn't picked going back to a Bush versus Obama situation, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1790.0s)]
*  if it's not the people we pick that we're OK with, we're going to destroy their lives. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1795.0s)]
*  We're going to can't even get a lawyer. They'll arrest your lawyer for defending you. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1800.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we're going to make up stuff. We're going to say your property that's worth a billion dollars is worth $13.74. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1805.0s)]
*  We're going to do whatever we can. And this is to show not just Trump, but anybody in the next 50 years, we will seek the FBI, the CIA. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1812.0s)]
*  We will destroy you if you're not our chosen people. And that's what I think is going on. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1821.0s)]
*  If Trump is prevented from appearing on the ballot in November, if he's arrested, you know, something even worse happens, which is entirely possible. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1827.0s)]
*  Next step. Of course, it's the next step. I don't want to say it out loud. Everyone. I hate saying it. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1838.0s)]
*  No, of course, I'm not going to. But everyone knows I'm talking about. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1843.0s)]
*  But if he is prevented, if democracy is prevented from proceeding, what do you think the response from his voters is going to be? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1846.0s)]
*  I think it's going to be a lot of rallies as you follow this carefully. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1855.0s)]
*  Well, why do you think they do the January 6 things? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1858.0s)]
*  They want you scared that if you do anything, you could be 80 foot away, you know, outside the tape of the Capitol. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1861.0s)]
*  You could be half a mile away and they're going to come after you because there haven't been any. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1868.0s)]
*  I mean, this used to be a country where people felt free to assemble, as is guaranteed them in the Constitution, to make their views known. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1872.0s)]
*  And then there's the [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1880.0s)]
*  elections and rallies. You haven't seen January 6th was the last one on the right that I'm aware of. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1882.0s)]
*  They that's what they're trying to do. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1887.0s)]
*  Scary. So but do you think that there will be demonstrations if something? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1889.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's it's yeah. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1894.0s)]
*  But like I say, they're just making him more powerful, making Trump more. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1897.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I hate to tell you, you lived this, but because of you in a hundred years, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1902.0s)]
*  I mean, I hate to tell you, but because of me or even you, they're going to be talking about Trump in a hundred years. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1908.0s)]
*  I agree with that. He's going to be one of the biggest figures in the history of our country, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1911.0s)]
*  not because of what he did, but because of how they're treating him and they're making him more powerful. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1917.0s)]
*  And if he gets arrested and gets put in a jail, can you imagine? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1922.0s)]
*  And it could happen. People say it couldn't happen. Oh, it could happen. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1926.0s)]
*  It could happen very easily. Yeah. Who should he pick as his running mate? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1929.0s)]
*  Oh, man, I go back and forth from this. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1933.0s)]
*  I would like to say this, that I don't think the VP pick really matters that much. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1937.0s)]
*  I mean, we got Harris as a VP. Yeah. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1942.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you, it takes a long time for me to trust you. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1945.0s)]
*  But I'm starting to like Vivek and I'm not sure if he's fake and I'm not sure if it's just a show. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1949.0s)]
*  But man, he's pissing them off. Oh, that is me. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1955.0s)]
*  Yeah, they hate him. They do. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1959.0s)]
*  And he's saying, I mean, boy, they repud them debates. My God, he got Ronan McDaniel. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1962.0s)]
*  He got all of them mad. But he and isn't it funny? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1967.0s)]
*  He's running the campaign exactly what DeSantis should have been running. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1971.0s)]
*  He's running the campaign that DeSantis, but DeSantis is running a Nikki Haley campaign. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1976.0s)]
*  Does it seem that way? It does to me. Why? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1981.0s)]
*  I think you said something about his online team is just so cringe. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1984.0s)]
*  And I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have gotten involved in that. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1988.0s)]
*  I've been trying to stay out of it. I just and I know what they are. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1990.0s)]
*  And they but yeah, I don't understand it. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1993.0s)]
*  I mean, people like, you know, people build trust with you. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=1996.0s)]
*  It's consistency over time. Yeah. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2002.0s)]
*  And when you're a Trump supporter, well, some of them hated Trump and you love Trump and you love him. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2005.0s)]
*  And now you love DeSantis. And if he's gone, you're going to love Nikki Haley. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2010.0s)]
*  People don't trust that. And I don't have anything against any of them. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2014.0s)]
*  I mute a lot of them. I don't carry grudges with these people. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2018.0s)]
*  And I welcome anybody in when it's over. Of course. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2022.0s)]
*  You know, I don't have any grudge. Do you think that but it does seem I mean, I don't follow it very closely. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2025.0s)]
*  I'll admit I don't want to follow it closely, but it does seem like there's an enormous bitterness between the DeSantis people and the Trump. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2030.0s)]
*  Oh, there is. It's crazy. And I try not to get into the personal attacks. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2037.0s)]
*  I'm kind of like Trump, even on X. I if you want to, you know, I'm a shit poster if you want. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2043.0s)]
*  If you want to come at the shit poster, a million followers come in an army of, you know, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2050.0s)]
*  phone went out the mouth just waiting for me to say something, you know, to get on somebody. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2056.0s)]
*  But I very seldom I don't just attack first. But, you know, if you keep attacking me. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2061.0s)]
*  Yeah. And but it doesn't bother me. I don't I don't take any of this stuff personally. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2066.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't either. You know, they call me every name in the book. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2070.0s)]
*  You know what? I'll be called, you know, they'll you know, you're old, you're fat, you're ugly. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2075.0s)]
*  I mean, that's how they fight with, you know, which all three are kind of true. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2081.0s)]
*  I'll have to beat him the next round. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2085.0s)]
*  But people get so mad at this and you have to like if you have to step back from it. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2087.0s)]
*  And I think it's funny. I've lived in the real world where, you know, I've been in bar fights, you know, real stuff. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2092.0s)]
*  So, you know, somebody called me ugly and old and a boomer. I don't care. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2099.0s)]
*  Yeah. Do you? I don't care. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2104.0s)]
*  I don't even know what people say. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2106.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. I don't know. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2108.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2110.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2112.0s)]
*  Yeah. Do you? I don't care. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2113.0s)]
*  I don't even know what people say. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2115.0s)]
*  I care what the people I love think. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2117.0s)]
*  That's me too. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2119.0s)]
*  That's it. And like you, I have a lot of dogs, which really helps. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2120.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2123.0s)]
*  Do you think the breach between those two camps, Trump to Santos, can be fixed? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2124.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think some of it, some people can't, but most people can. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2130.0s)]
*  But this is my first primary. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2135.0s)]
*  I mean, it's been, I don't know if it's ever been this vicious, but so I supported the Santas. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2138.0s)]
*  I'm a Florida guy and I was glad he was our governor. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2144.0s)]
*  Oh, me too. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2146.0s)]
*  I don't get paid by any campaign and I pushed hard and I was so glad when he won by 20 points. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2147.0s)]
*  Me too. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2152.0s)]
*  And I was so happy. And I think he's a good governor. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2153.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2156.0s)]
*  And so, and I try to tell people, you got, I don't want him so beaten down and hammered that we end up getting a blue governor next, you know, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2157.0s)]
*  a Gavin Newsom to destroy our state. I mean, you're here now. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2167.0s)]
*  But someone from his team, not crazy high, but they asked me my honest opinion about it when he said he was going to run. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2171.0s)]
*  And I was like, don't do it. Whatever you do, don't run. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2180.0s)]
*  Think about, and this is what I told him. I said, okay, he's 44. Young, young. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2184.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2189.0s)]
*  And he just won reelection by the biggest landslide. I was like. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2190.0s)]
*  Govern your state. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2196.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it perfect. How perfect is the timing? When you're with the end of your eight years is up, it's right. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2197.0s)]
*  Would be right getting in the meat of the 2028. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2203.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2206.0s)]
*  So I, this is what I tell them, support Trump because he helps you and you don't want the Trump supporters. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2207.0s)]
*  They can destroy you. I mean, you don't want them. You know, you don't want to turn on them. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2215.0s)]
*  I swear. I said, look, just please, this is my advice. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2219.0s)]
*  Just have him govern governor support Trump all he can. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2223.0s)]
*  And in twenty eight, you got Biden with only four years left or Trump with only four years left. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2227.0s)]
*  And now you're more popular. And now you have all the Trump people. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2232.0s)]
*  You have all the DeSantis people and you can moonwalk into the White House in twenty twenty eight. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2236.0s)]
*  Moonwalk. That's my exact words. I use. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2241.0s)]
*  What was the response you got? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2243.0s)]
*  Yeah, OK. Thanks. A lot of people don't take me too seriously, but it and I hate it. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2245.0s)]
*  I hate it's going like this. But a lot of people do take you seriously, which is interesting. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2253.0s)]
*  It is. And I can see why I think you're insightful. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2257.0s)]
*  Thank you. How many politicians have you met personally? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2260.0s)]
*  Well, when they when personally, you know, I kind of keep to myself, but DM wise and messaged me. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2264.0s)]
*  They all love me when it comes to election time. Hey, will you retweet this and retweet this? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2271.0s)]
*  And I can't name five people in either party. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2276.0s)]
*  I trust I just don't trust anybody anymore. And they don't they don't deserve our trust. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2280.0s)]
*  The Republican Party. I mean, come on. They don't know how to fight. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2284.0s)]
*  No, I know that they're over there talking about their principles and their arrest in their political opponents. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2287.0s)]
*  So you better get in the game and we get the power of the gavel. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2293.0s)]
*  And what do they do with it? Seriously? Nothing. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2296.0s)]
*  I mean, this is how you fight. When you get the gavel, you do your own January 6 committee. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2299.0s)]
*  But do you think it's because they don't understand how to fight or they're throwing the match? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2304.0s)]
*  I don't know if they just don't care or they don't know how or they're just cowards. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2308.0s)]
*  But the truth is, see, this is how you fight. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2313.0s)]
*  You get a January 6 committee and you don't allow any Democrats on it and you put everybody on it. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2316.0s)]
*  They hate just like they did us. You put Marge Taylor Greene, Boebert, McCabe's. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2322.0s)]
*  That's the January 6 committee. You don't allow them to have any witnesses and you start subpoena. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2327.0s)]
*  Let's see what Nancy Pelosi was talking to the Capitol Police. You start subpoena everybody. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2332.0s)]
*  And you have it on C-SPAN every day for years. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2336.0s)]
*  And if you don't start fighting like that, it's over for this country. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2339.0s)]
*  Well, but and also you have an obligation to that because it's in pursuit of the truth. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2343.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2347.0s)]
*  What do you make of the fact that the new Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has not released the videotape, which he controls? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2348.0s)]
*  Well, I told everybody, you know, that he was he was going to be awful. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2355.0s)]
*  I warned everybody that had that little kumbaya moment. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2359.0s)]
*  He did. What did he do? Is that exactly what Kevin McCarthy did? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2362.0s)]
*  He said he's going to release it. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2365.0s)]
*  So they get the big headlines gets everybody excited. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2367.0s)]
*  They release one percent of one percent and then they just don't do it anymore. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2369.0s)]
*  And look what when when when you release that the Q shaman, he got out of prison because of that one little five minutes. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2374.0s)]
*  Think of what if they would just release it, just release it. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2382.0s)]
*  But they can't do it. It's just push the button. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2385.0s)]
*  Just push the button and release it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2387.0s)]
*  I know when he was talking about Ukraine funding, he was like, well, we have to at some point do the Ukraine funding because we don't want Russia steamrolling over Europe. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2389.0s)]
*  That was his exact words or a paraphrasing close. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2399.0s)]
*  You think I mean, obviously you'd have to be really stupid to believe that I'm assuming he's not stupid. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2402.0s)]
*  I mean, why would he say something? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2408.0s)]
*  It's the same thing they always do to get us ginned up about a war. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2409.0s)]
*  Also, by the way, if Russia invaded Western Europe, could it be in worse shape than it is now? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2413.0s)]
*  I mean, it was the U.S. government that blew up the German economy. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2418.0s)]
*  It wasn't the Russians. It was the Biden administration that blew up Nord Stream. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2421.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And ended their main source of cheap energy. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2425.0s)]
*  So could the Russians be worse than that? Maybe, I guess. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2428.0s)]
*  But like, I don't get it. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2431.0s)]
*  Well, you know, they've used Ukraine as kind of their fifty first state and they would know rules. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2433.0s)]
*  The bio labs, which they lied about and told the truth. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2438.0s)]
*  Everybody in Washington, their kids over there making four million dollars a year, you know, at some kind of company. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2441.0s)]
*  But so I don't I don't let them gin me up. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2449.0s)]
*  And they try to gin you up more and get you mad. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2453.0s)]
*  And I can't get emotional when we have one hundred thousand people dying of fentanyl poison in our own country. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2456.0s)]
*  I'm not going to get emotional. I hate war. I'm anti-war. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2462.0s)]
*  I'm the one that wants a peace deal. You're the one that wants to keep. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2466.0s)]
*  And here's the problem with Ukraine. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2469.0s)]
*  I think we're going to end up in the same spot a year or so from now. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2471.0s)]
*  I think there will be a peace agreement at some point. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2474.0s)]
*  And there's going to be a million dead people. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2476.0s)]
*  And Russia is going to take a little bit of the country and we're going to be in the same place we would have been. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2478.0s)]
*  And no one will ever apologize for all those dead. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2482.0s)]
*  And they're just going to cause poop and puppets because we want peace. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2485.0s)]
*  And that's it. Couldn't agree more. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2488.0s)]
*  So, first of all, thank you for doing this. I appreciate it. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2490.0s)]
*  No problem. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2492.0s)]
*  Last question. Do you. So you've you went from installing fiber line to becoming legitimately famous only because of your voice. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2494.0s)]
*  You were allowed to talk in public purely democratically. People liked what you said. They supported you. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2504.0s)]
*  All of that is contingent on having a voice. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2510.0s)]
*  Do you think a year from now you will have the same voice? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2512.0s)]
*  You'll be allowed to say the things that you are saying now. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2515.0s)]
*  Well, I hope so. But you see what they're doing to come after me. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2518.0s)]
*  I hate to say this, but I tell my family all the time. Hey, the FBI could frame me. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2522.0s)]
*  Who? No, I mean, I don't trust them. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2529.0s)]
*  No, I hate saying that I want an FBI that I don't feel that way about. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2531.0s)]
*  But hey, you know, they can do anything they can. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2535.0s)]
*  If they want to get me, they're going to get me. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2538.0s)]
*  But I'm not going to shut up. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2540.0s)]
*  So that's it. I'm not shutting up. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2542.0s)]
*  So do you feel that you will be able to reach the same audience a year from now? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2544.0s)]
*  I think so. I mean, it's gone up. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2549.0s)]
*  I'm you know, I'm doing my own events now. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2552.0s)]
*  We're doing we did Turdstock. I do want to mention that, which was it was kind of a John Rich and I was kind of a joke. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2556.0s)]
*  And I said, no, I'm serious. Instead of, you know, Woodstock was the Turdstock. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2563.0s)]
*  And where did you do it? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2567.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a Redneck Riviera up at his place in November. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2569.0s)]
*  That's my big coming out where everybody got to see me and had some great musicians. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2573.0s)]
*  We're actually one of the musicians, Angie Apero, who is a has got a you'd love this story, Tucker. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2578.0s)]
*  It's the great American comeback story. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2586.0s)]
*  He he was he wrote a cry for Faith Hill. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2588.0s)]
*  She won a Grammy and he was this like unbelievable musician with his voice. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2592.0s)]
*  And he was on his way up, signed with a record label. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2600.0s)]
*  And then he had a stroke and completely lost his voice and couldn't talk. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2605.0s)]
*  And so he spent, I think, 2016, 2017, learned how to talk again. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2609.0s)]
*  And so now he's on his way back up and we he was he was there and we're we're doing an event for him on the 24th. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2616.0s)]
*  So I'm going to just keep kind of staying in my lane and just do what I do. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2625.0s)]
*  You know, I probably won't go into the red carpet events to meet everybody and get pictures. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2633.0s)]
*  But so we're going to miss you at Davos next week. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2640.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be there. You're not going to be there. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2643.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't know. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2645.0s)]
*  I just don't I don't seem like I fit in there to me. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2647.0s)]
*  I'm more of the hanging out with the people kind of person. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2649.0s)]
*  But it was nice to meet you. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2653.0s)]
*  And I really appreciate you inviting me. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Soy5Dx-wyM&t=2655.0s)]
