# Tucker Carlson and Russ Vought Break Down DOGE and All of Trump’s Cabinet Picks So Far
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI)
*  So you ran OMB before, and you don't have to comment on this, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=0.0s)]
*  it sounds like you are very likely to run OMB again. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5.08s)]
*  Tell us what OMB is for those who aren't from Washington, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  what it does and what you would do with it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=14.48s)]
*  So OMB is the nerve center of the federal government, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=17.48s)]
*  particularly the executive branch. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=20.28s)]
*  So it has the ability to turn on and off any spending [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=22.2s)]
*  within the- [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=25.88s)]
*  Office of Management and Budget. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=26.72s)]
*  Office of Management and Budget. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  It has the ability to turn off the spending [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=28.96s)]
*  that's going on at the agencies. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=30.6s)]
*  It has all the regulations coming through it [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=32.96s)]
*  to assess whether it's good or bad or too expensive [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=35.88s)]
*  or it could be done a different way [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=39.64s)]
*  or what does the president think. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=40.92s)]
*  And then all of government execution. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=42.72s)]
*  So anytime you have cabinet executive branches [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=44.72s)]
*  conflicting with each other or working together [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=48.28s)]
*  on something, for instance, the wall, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=50.88s)]
*  the president wanted to fund the wall, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  we at OMB gave him a plan to be able to go [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  and fund the wall through money [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=58.52s)]
*  that was at the Department of Defense and to use that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=60.24s)]
*  because Congress wouldn't give him the ordinary money [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  at the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=66.36s)]
*  So it really is presidents use OMB to tame the bureaucracy, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=67.92s)]
*  the administrative state. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  It was really pioneered honestly, by FDR. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=76.56s)]
*  And then present in Nixon also was really learning [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=80.76s)]
*  from FDR on how to use it to taint Answers depends [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  on the use and the nature of how we use it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=88.84s)]
*  So actually itintares the economy [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=91.72s)]
*  and how we're going to host the next Frisc. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=94.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's a pretty central source of SCWA [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=98.0s)]
*  for this office. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  learning from FDR on how to use it to tame the bureaucracy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=102.52s)]
*  And we would have seen that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=106.92s)]
*  Did he create the office, Roosevelt? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  The office was formerly the Bureau of the Budget [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=110.28s)]
*  for the last 100 years, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=113.0s)]
*  And then Nixon renames it Office of Management and Budget, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=115.61999999999999s)]
*  and it becomes kind of more of a statutory thing, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=119.44s)]
*  reporting directly to the president, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  no longer within Treasury. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=125.08s)]
*  And so since then, you've had it still there, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  still really important, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=132.56s)]
*  viewed by the country largely as a budget cutting exercise, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=134.4s)]
*  but it is the president's most important tool [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=139.0s)]
*  to dealing with the bureaucracy administrative state. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=142.96s)]
*  And the nice thing about President Trump is he knows that, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=145.96s)]
*  and he knows how to use it effectively. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=149.84s)]
*  So you can't get any of your domestic policy done [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  without OMB, it sounds like. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  No, you will be in a situation where you will have, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  at best, really awesome cabinet secretaries [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=160.42s)]
*  who are sitting on top of massive bureaucracies [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=164.54s)]
*  that largely don't do what they tell them to do. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  And you have to have statutory tools at your disposal [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=171.98s)]
*  that force that bureaucracy from the White House [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=176.56s)]
*  to get in line. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=179.38s)]
*  And that is really the main thing that OMB can accomplish [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=180.22s)]
*  in addition to what everyone would think of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=185.06s)]
*  from a budget office, which is, yeah, you cut spending, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  you figure out how to deal with your fiscal finances [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=189.92s)]
*  and all of that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=192.32s)]
*  You're making me anxious. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I can't handle a disobedient dog. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=195.48s)]
*  I can't imagine what a disobedient federal agency looks like. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=197.61999999999998s)]
*  How resistant are they to democracy? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=200.82s)]
*  They're incredibly resistant. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=204.38s)]
*  I mean, think about Ukraine and the president [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  in that first term wanted to cut off funding for Ukraine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=209.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=214.22s)]
*  Because it's a corrupt country [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=215.06s)]
*  and we didn't know how it was gonna be spent. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=216.0s)]
*  It was totally normal policy process to go through [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=217.76s)]
*  that the people lost their minds about. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=220.72s)]
*  But the bureaucracy was literally just ignoring it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=223.32s)]
*  And quite frankly, his political appointees like John Bolton [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=226.0s)]
*  were ignoring him as well. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  And what we then did at OMB was I had been personally told, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=231.48s)]
*  like, I want the money cut off [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  until we can figure out where it's going [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=237.48s)]
*  and we cut the money off. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=239.16s)]
*  And it was like all hell broke loose within the bureaucracy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  We got impeached. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=244.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=245.8s)]
*  And so you have the ability at that point [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  to bring them to come to heel [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  and to do what the president has been telling them to do. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=253.24s)]
*  And we can do that in foreign aid. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  We can do that all sorts of places. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=257.72s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, everything you're saying I'm familiar with, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=260.04s)]
*  but if you think about it, that's the end of democracy [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=262.48s)]
*  because the only authority in the executive branch [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=266.52s)]
*  comes from the president and the vice president also elected, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=268.64s)]
*  but it comes from voters as expressed through elections. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=271.56s)]
*  So bureaucrats in the federal agency, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=274.76000000000005s)]
*  appointees in the federal agency, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=276.76000000000005s)]
*  have no authority to act independently. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=278.0s)]
*  That I'm under our constitution, do they? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=281.92s)]
*  No. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=283.68s)]
*  And this is really, the left has innovated over a hundred years [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  to create this fourth branch of an administrative state. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=287.8s)]
*  You and I might call it the regime, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=291.36s)]
*  this administrative state that is totally unaccountable [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  to the president that lets it move in the direction [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=297.24s)]
*  that it has been going. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  But the president is accountable to voters. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=302.36s)]
*  So are members of Congress. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=304.24s)]
*  And the system is designed that way. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  That's why we say it's a democracy [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=308.72s)]
*  or a constitutional republic, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  because the voters convey, bestow the authority [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  on their leaders. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=317.64s)]
*  And so this seems not only illegal, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  their behavior, but unconstitutional. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=321.56s)]
*  I mean, at the most basic level unconstitutional now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=323.36s)]
*  Totally unconstitutional. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=325.92s)]
*  And if you would have seen Woodrow Wilson [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=327.12s)]
*  bemoan our constitutional system, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=328.8s)]
*  he would have wanted constitutional amendments. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=331.2s)]
*  The left stopped talking about constitutional amendments [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=333.6s)]
*  because they innovated to this new fourth branch, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=336.08s)]
*  which is totally different than anything [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=339.2s)]
*  the founders would have ever understood. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=341.36s)]
*  The notion of independent agencies that think of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=343.76s)]
*  and Congress has designed them to be divorced [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  from the president. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=349.36s)]
*  But even the notion of like, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=350.6s)]
*  we're supposed to be technocrats and experts [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=354.76s)]
*  and we don't have to listen to what you say. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=357.12s)]
*  We work for, and I caught this Tucker. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=359.24s)]
*  People would say, well, we work for the office [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=362.16s)]
*  of the president. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=364.92s)]
*  Huh? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=366.12s)]
*  What? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  What is that? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  It's a way- [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=368.62s)]
*  Where does it get its authority? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=369.46000000000004s)]
*  They get their authority. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=371.12s)]
*  They have essentially taken authority. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  They have no legitimate authority. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=376.48s)]
*  They have no legitimate authority in the constitution, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  but they are part of this fourth branch [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  that I still believe reports in large measure [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=384.06s)]
*  to congressional leadership [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=387.24s)]
*  and in the K Street interest, right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=389.24s)]
*  You have very powerful interests that direct them [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=391.6s)]
*  to keep going in the direction that they want them to go. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=395.0s)]
*  It's why these bills are written in such a way [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=398.20000000000005s)]
*  that they are anything, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  you could read anything into them, right? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=402.16s)]
*  When Nancy Pelosi says, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=404.6s)]
*  we're gonna find out what the bill says, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=406.16s)]
*  she wasn't actually being inaccurate. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=408.6s)]
*  That's their strategy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  They pass bills and then they let the experts fill them in, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  but over the phone, they put massive pressure on them [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=416.14000000000004s)]
*  to go along with their directions and their ends. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=419.32s)]
*  And lo and behold, you get conservatives, Republicans [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  that take office, and then you find [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=427.44s)]
*  that it's incredibly difficult to wield power [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=429.44s)]
*  to get them to deal with all of that muscle memory, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=432.28s)]
*  to get them to do what you want. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=435.12s)]
*  And so you gotta have statutory authority [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=436.92s)]
*  that a president kind of steps in and says, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=439.4s)]
*  I am fully aware of where I sit in the constitution. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=442.28s)]
*  I am fully aware of the tools at my disposal, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=445.28s)]
*  and I'm going to use them on behalf of the American people [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=448.28s)]
*  because I just want a massive agenda setting election [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=451.79999999999995s)]
*  and I'm gonna go do what I said I would do. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=455.4s)]
*  That's democracy, correct? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=457.4s)]
*  That is democracy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  That is not oligarchy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  And when they say we're gonna preserve democracy, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=461.28s)]
*  we know that they have been meaning, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=463.79999999999995s)]
*  all they wanna do is preserve their kind of amorphous [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=465.32s)]
*  oligarchy administrative deep state. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=468.52s)]
*  I don't think that's an overstatement at all. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=472.11999999999995s)]
*  I mean, I just think, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=474.7s)]
*  I don't even see the kind of argument [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=475.53999999999996s)]
*  against what you just said. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=476.84s)]
*  So let's just, if you don't mind walking us through [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=477.8s)]
*  what happened in the example that you gave Ukraine. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=480.28s)]
*  So you just said the president comes into office in 2017 [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=483.12s)]
*  and says, why are we sending all this money to Ukraine? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=487.28s)]
*  Where's it going? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=488.96s)]
*  There's no audit. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=489.8s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=490.62s)]
*  It's the most corrupt country in Europe, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=491.46s)]
*  one of the most corrupt in the world. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=492.3s)]
*  Maybe we should find out, we don't know. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=493.2s)]
*  Okay, we're cutting off till we know. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=494.82s)]
*  I think that's what you said. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=496.52s)]
*  And the agency's like, no, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  we're gonna continue to fund Ukraine. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=501.2s)]
*  How do they do that? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=503.0s)]
*  They ignore the president [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=505.08s)]
*  and officials ignore the president. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=507.88s)]
*  And I think one of the things you'll see [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=511.32s)]
*  in this next Trump term is policy officials, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=512.76s)]
*  his political appointees that are not looking to get out [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=516.96s)]
*  of what he has clearly told them to do. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=520.52s)]
*  So let's assume that issue is solved. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=522.68s)]
*  But at the bureaucratic level. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=525.26s)]
*  The issue, I think what you're saying is, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=526.48s)]
*  let's assume that he appoints people who agree with him [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=528.88s)]
*  and will do what he asks. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=531.04s)]
*  Correct. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=532.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=532.88s)]
*  So my staff was part of what we call the policy process, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=534.26s)]
*  where you would go and you defend [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=538.1800000000001s)]
*  and you would articulate what you're trying to accomplish. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=541.98s)]
*  And we had put the hold on the Ukraine funding. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=544.5200000000001s)]
*  And my guy goes to all of these meetings [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=547.58s)]
*  and he's like literally the only one in the room [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=550.98s)]
*  that wants to do what the president has asked him to do. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=553.24s)]
*  Everyone's kind of just ganging up on him. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=555.62s)]
*  And that is, think of that often [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=558.34s)]
*  for all of our political appointees. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=562.18s)]
*  They are surrounded by people that have no idea [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  about what the reasons and the agenda [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=568.7399999999999s)]
*  that the president has been put in office. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=571.42s)]
*  And they're just bombarded with reasons [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=573.4599999999999s)]
*  of how can you do this? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=575.38s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  Did you know that this is, you can't do this? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=577.78s)]
*  Most of the time that's not true. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=579.9799999999999s)]
*  And so you have to cut through all of that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=581.66s)]
*  and to have the courage of your convictions [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=586.06s)]
*  and quite frankly, Tucker, the know-how to know, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=588.02s)]
*  to have read the law, to get in the granular details [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=591.06s)]
*  yourselves, to not be staffed by your people working for you. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=594.2199999999999s)]
*  This notion that you can just come in and preside [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=599.6999999999999s)]
*  is not true. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=601.68s)]
*  You have to be in the weeds and to drive these agencies [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=602.52s)]
*  to be able to fix where we have the undergrowth [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=607.9s)]
*  and the muscle memory that we've had for decades. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=611.42s)]
*  So why can't you just, so if the president says, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=614.5799999999999s)]
*  again, to refer to your example, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=617.26s)]
*  I don't think we should be funding Ukraine, I'm elected. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=619.8199999999999s)]
*  We're gonna cut this off. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=623.1s)]
*  If Congress wants to fund Ukraine, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=624.5799999999999s)]
*  they can go ahead and do that. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=625.8199999999999s)]
*  But the agencies are not gonna fund Ukraine. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=626.8s)]
*  So why wouldn't you just fire the people who disobey, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=628.6999999999999s)]
*  who try to subvert democracy? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=633.26s)]
*  You've got to know how to fire them. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=636.3399999999999s)]
*  And there are tools to do that. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=638.22s)]
*  And the president was innovating in that space himself [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=640.22s)]
*  with what's called schedule F of essentially saying, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  if you work for me in your policy, a career official, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=646.98s)]
*  think your attorneys who are writing regulations, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=650.4200000000001s)]
*  then we're gonna create a new classification for you. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=653.3000000000001s)]
*  And you are gonna be what most of the country is, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  which is at will employee. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=658.98s)]
*  That's where we were headed. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=661.24s)]
*  But there was also ways that- [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=662.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't understand a system where a president, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=663.9s)]
*  any president, Obama, Biden, Donald Trump, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=666.5s)]
*  comes in and doesn't have control of the executive branch [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=671.3000000000001s)]
*  because constitutionally he does have control. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=675.54s)]
*  So like, how come you can't fire them? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=677.42s)]
*  Why is it just not as simple as saying you're fired? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=679.54s)]
*  It should be. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=682.02s)]
*  And this is one of the mountains [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=682.86s)]
*  of the administrative state. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=685.86s)]
*  You know, this is how they have built their institution [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=687.06s)]
*  by essentially having it be incredibly difficult [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=691.42s)]
*  to hire and fire employees. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=696.3s)]
*  And so I'll give another example. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=697.9399999999999s)]
*  When the president decided to take money from defense [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=700.0999999999999s)]
*  to build the wall, we had clear legal grounds to do it [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=702.9s)]
*  that Congress had given us. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=707.34s)]
*  It's called transfer authority. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=709.1800000000001s)]
*  And I told this to the Hill. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=711.22s)]
*  And obviously this was controversial. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=713.3000000000001s)]
*  It shouldn't have been controversial. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=715.42s)]
*  Congress had given us very clear transfer authority. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=716.7s)]
*  I must have had at least three times [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=719.9s)]
*  someone relitigate that decision [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=723.14s)]
*  from the career staff who work at OMB. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=725.02s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=727.38s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=728.2s)]
*  I think we should oppose. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=729.04s)]
*  I think this- [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=729.88s)]
*  The decision has been made. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=731.6800000000001s)]
*  Execute the decision. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=733.24s)]
*  And you see that everywhere, right? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=735.32s)]
*  And if you don't drive it, you're gonna get better. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=738.2s)]
*  You're not gonna be able to accomplish [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  what the president needs you to accomplish. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=744.96s)]
*  How about if you were to just start the meeting with any, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=746.08s)]
*  okay, this is how democracy works. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=748.72s)]
*  The people elect a leader. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=750.4s)]
*  He carries out their will. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=752.0s)]
*  Anyone standing in the way of that is subverting democracy. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=753.8000000000001s)]
*  We will not allow that. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=757.32s)]
*  Anyone who does that is fired instantly. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=758.4s)]
*  Could you do that? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  And just say you're fired for unconstitutional behavior? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=760.9599999999999s)]
*  You can do that increasingly [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=763.88s)]
*  when you move towards a schedule F system. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=765.64s)]
*  And there are other tools in the toolbox. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=768.16s)]
*  But under the current system, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=770.56s)]
*  what would happen if you tried that? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=771.8s)]
*  If you just- [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=773.0s)]
*  Lawsuits. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=773.8399999999999s)]
*  Lawsuits. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=774.66s)]
*  Lawsuits, yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=775.5s)]
*  But if you fire them all. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  Look, you've got a lot of tools on the table. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=778.48s)]
*  And- [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=780.68s)]
*  It's just so infuriating. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=781.8s)]
*  Look, it is one of the most infuriating things [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=783.88s)]
*  that you could possibly imagine. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=786.12s)]
*  But I think that the good news, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=788.68s)]
*  and this is, I think the good news, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=790.92s)]
*  not just in hiring, firing, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=792.42s)]
*  the good news at large is that most of the time, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  they have been able to get as far as they can [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=798.88s)]
*  because of just, it is the way it is. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=801.1999999999999s)]
*  It's precedent and laws that are not drafted precisely, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=803.16s)]
*  but purposely vague. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=808.8399999999999s)]
*  And as a result, we can then do it in reverse. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=810.52s)]
*  You can have a president who steps in and says, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=814.24s)]
*  you know what, there's no constitutional amendment [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=816.52s)]
*  for me to take control of the administrative state. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=818.52s)]
*  I'm gonna do in reverse everything that you have done. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=821.24s)]
*  And I think that is the great hope. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=824.44s)]
*  What you need is people who are able [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=826.6s)]
*  to absorb political heat. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=829.48s)]
*  They don't have a fear of conflict. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=832.6s)]
*  They can execute under withering enemy fire. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=834.6s)]
*  They are up to speed and they are no nonsense [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=837.48s)]
*  in their own ability to know what must be done. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=840.08s)]
*  And they are unbelievably committed [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=843.9s)]
*  to the president and his agenda [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=846.3s)]
*  and truly believe in their bones [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=848.06s)]
*  that they're not there for their own agenda. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=851.3s)]
*  They're there for what President Trump was elected to do. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=853.22s)]
*  And so his commander's intent matters a great deal. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=857.02s)]
*  And that's the view that I always had, Tucker, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=861.06s)]
*  is how do I get in the mind of the president [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=862.98s)]
*  to think through what is he trying to accomplish? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=865.24s)]
*  And then I'm gonna go figure out how to do it. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=867.54s)]
*  Yeah, because once again, he is the authority [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=870.42s)]
*  and no one else does, because only he was elected. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=873.0s)]
*  And I'm fixated on this question of like, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=875.4s)]
*  where do career bureaucrats think they derive the authority [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=878.48s)]
*  to make these decisions? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=880.88s)]
*  Like who made them God? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=881.96s)]
*  I think it's very, no one ever asked that question in DC. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=883.8s)]
*  You're considered a freak if you do, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=886.76s)]
*  but I think it's a key question. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=887.94s)]
*  So one of the problems that you had last time was the media. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=890.0s)]
*  Explain how that works, how the media works [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=893.38s)]
*  in conjunction with the permanent state [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=895.36s)]
*  and the Congress to thwart the president. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=897.38s)]
*  Well, I think number one, they are always framing narratives [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=899.88s)]
*  and messages that both are lies and are also designed [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=905.28s)]
*  to destabilize the Republicans in control [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=910.68s)]
*  who wanna be for however that narrative is being framed. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=915.18s)]
*  You used one already with democracy, right? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=918.84s)]
*  If you're not aware that when they say democracy, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=921.88s)]
*  they mean oligarchy, you're like, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=924.24s)]
*  I don't wanna be anti-democratic. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=925.54s)]
*  That's the whole point is preserving democracy, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=928.2s)]
*  it's what we just did. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=930.28s)]
*  And if you have a plan to deal with the administrative state [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=931.12s)]
*  and then they frame it as authoritarian, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=935.16s)]
*  you don't wanna cast of your own allies saying, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=937.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't wanna be anti-authoritarian. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=940.24s)]
*  We saw this in COVID, right? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=942.36s)]
*  Where if they define something as anti-science [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=944.08s)]
*  or anti-public health, it causes our political appointees [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=949.6s)]
*  to just completely wilt, right? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=953.24s)]
*  And so that's, I think the beauty of President Trump [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=955.4s)]
*  is he's kind of immune to these media generated narratives [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=957.4s)]
*  that conflict with common sense reality. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  That I think is the main one because that is controlling [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=965.68s)]
*  the skies from a military standpoint, right? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=969.84s)]
*  Like that is their ability to shape the conversation [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=971.92s)]
*  in such a way that it makes it very hard. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=976.72s)]
*  Number two, they're obviously working in conjunction [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=978.84s)]
*  with leakers and individuals with know-how to know [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=982.64s)]
*  when a hold has been put on Ukraine to be able to send that [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=987.84s)]
*  and have it explode in the public arena. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=993.04s)]
*  And so you have to be prevent leaks, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=996.04s)]
*  you have to govern well from the get-go [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=999.06s)]
*  to be able to manage all of that as best you possibly can. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1002.64s)]
*  But I also think there's an opportunity there [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1007.72s)]
*  because they will report on conflict, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1009.88s)]
*  they will report on confrontation, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1013.04s)]
*  and when they do that, you can get the word out [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1014.58s)]
*  as to what you're doing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1017.32s)]
*  At least you can get the word out on shows like this [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1018.84s)]
*  and in the new and developing ecosystem. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1021.64s)]
*  Well, that's kind of it right there. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1024.52s)]
*  I mean, that was the basis of my question. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1025.8s)]
*  I do think things have changed, right? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1027.16s)]
*  I mean, if you still care what the New York Times [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1028.96s)]
*  or Washington Post say, or tend to lay needed NBC News, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1032.16s)]
*  like I hope you're not working there, right? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1036.32s)]
*  Do you think anybody still cares what they think? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1040.2800000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1041.8000000000002s)]
*  The whole ball game has shifted, right? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1044.5200000000002s)]
*  Like I don't even know why you would do [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1046.72s)]
*  many of these interviews at all, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1048.3600000000001s)]
*  because if you can't get, you know, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1050.68s)]
*  you've gotta be able to get your words out [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1052.68s)]
*  without just complete combativeness. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1055.4s)]
*  And I think the best example is remember [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1058.8000000000002s)]
*  the Caitlin Collins interview with President Trump. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1061.44s)]
*  I mean, it's just constant interrupting [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1064.4s)]
*  and misuse of lies actually, right? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1068.8s)]
*  And so like that's the kind of thing [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1072.76s)]
*  that you're up against, but you can shape them. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1074.08s)]
*  You can, particularly the print media. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1078.3999999999999s)]

*  they're complete activists themselves. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1093.08s)]
*  Do you remember when Democrats used to refer to abortion [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1095.1599999999999s)]
*  as something that should be safe, legal, and rare? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1097.4s)]
*  Well, they've changed their view on that. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1100.48s)]
*  It went from a right to a sacrament. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1102.44s)]
*  This isn't the pro-choice movement [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1105.2800000000002s)]

*  This is something much darker. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1109.64s)]
*  And that's why we have joined forces with Preborn, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1111.5600000000002s)]

*  Their networks of clinics are positioned [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1135.48s)]

*  it does seem like one of the main vectors of control [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1179.4399999999998s)]
*  is briefings, and the number of people [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1184.44s)]
*  I've spoken to, Congress, Executive Branch, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1187.0800000000002s)]

*  I think I lived there too long, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1191.72s)]

*  Maybe sometimes they're accurate, sometimes they're not, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1194.52s)]
*  but they're almost always designed [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1196.4s)]
*  to control the person being briefed. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1197.64s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1200.0s)]
*  I did, and I've very rarely ever learned anything [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1200.8400000000001s)]
*  particularly interesting in a briefing. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1203.68s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1205.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't tell you who killed Kennedy, huh? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1206.44s)]
*  They did not, right? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1208.16s)]
*  And so, I think I came away with the similar skepticism [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1209.3600000000001s)]
*  of these briefings and the information [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1214.08s)]
*  and the over-classification in the system. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1216.36s)]
*  They classify everything, and you're reading this thing, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1220.0s)]
*  and you're like, you realize that's all just normal stuff [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1222.6s)]
*  that's out in a congressional research service. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1226.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's on Twitter, so. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1228.6s)]
*  And so, I think that's a huge thing that we've gotta fix, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1229.6s)]
*  over-classification in the system, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1233.3999999999999s)]
*  but I think they both create this environment [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1235.3999999999999s)]
*  where it's very exclusive, they are trying to bring you [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1239.6399999999999s)]
*  into their kind of priestly role, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1244.32s)]
*  so that, no, I saw the briefing. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1246.44s)]
*  If you had seen the briefing, you would be okay [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1248.8s)]
*  with us not having a FISA warrant requirement. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1252.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1255.12s)]
*  You would be okay with us, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1256.04s)]
*  just another $100 billion for Ukraine, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1257.8s)]
*  just we can't have Ukraine fall. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1260.08s)]
*  None of it is rigorous analysis, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1263.44s)]
*  and honestly, I think that's the biggest thing [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1268.28s)]
*  that I was bemoaning, is the extent to which [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1269.88s)]
*  rigorous analysis that I thought would be there [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1274.44s)]
*  wasn't there. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1277.64s)]
*  What do you mean by rigorous analysis? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1278.7600000000002s)]
*  I don't expect people to agree with me constantly. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1281.48s)]
*  I want well-prepared memos that have a conviction to them [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1284.6000000000001s)]
*  and then support them. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1292.3200000000002s)]
*  It's not, these are not like, I'm gonna plant the flag, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1293.64s)]
*  and then we can say, okay, who's right, who's that, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1297.64s)]
*  who has better support, no, no. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1300.3200000000002s)]
*  It's like, I'm gonna give the blob an exercise [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1302.0800000000002s)]
*  to report on something, and the blob is going to kind of like, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1305.88s)]
*  it's not a Google spreadsheet, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1311.48s)]
*  but it's gonna all be an interactive Google spreadsheet [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1312.76s)]
*  to just spit out something that is a consensus document, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1316.16s)]
*  and you're reading this thing, and you're like, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1319.5200000000002s)]
*  this makes no real claims other than to affirm the narrative [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1320.8000000000002s)]
*  that we just talked about, right? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1324.4s)]
*  So what's the point other than to preserve the status quo? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1327.0s)]
*  At that point, the point is just to know [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1329.88s)]
*  what the intelligence community is writing on, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1331.56s)]
*  because you're not gonna learn anything from it. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1333.6s)]
*  I talked to someone recently in the last few days [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1335.52s)]
*  who works in the intel community, the IC, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1338.4s)]
*  who is saying that you can see people who come to Washington [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1342.0s)]
*  for the first time in high positions in either branch [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1345.44s)]
*  before and after their briefings, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1348.4s)]
*  and they're like different people, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1350.08s)]
*  and they fall for it, like all of them fall for it. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1351.6s)]
*  Now we're gonna tell you all the things you wondered about [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1354.56s)]
*  and we're gonna tell you the truth about them, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1356.76s)]
*  presidents especially, Trump seems, as you said, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1358.12s)]
*  immune from this, and he's done it before, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1361.04s)]
*  but this person said you should see how much they change, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1363.16s)]
*  like deep inside, once we lay the bullshit on them, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1366.8799999999999s)]
*  they're not the same. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1371.08s)]
*  Have you noticed that? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1372.68s)]
*  Oh, I haven't seen it. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1373.52s)]
*  I think part of the problem, and this is endemic [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1375.2s)]
*  of not just the IC, but we don't read enough in general, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1377.68s)]
*  we don't have our own convictions, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1382.7s)]
*  we don't search for understanding ourselves, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1385.44s)]
*  and so you have people go in and they're like, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1388.56s)]
*  I kinda need this career staff to tell me what to think, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1391.04s)]
*  I don't wanna look stupid, right? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1394.52s)]
*  And so that has killed us on our side of the aisle, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1396.48s)]
*  the conservative side, to say we don't have people [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1400.6000000000001s)]
*  that are driving policy and bringing their own opinions [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1403.7s)]
*  into their own history, and so they are susceptible [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1406.6000000000001s)]
*  to feeling like, and they still believe [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1410.72s)]
*  that these people have an authoritative stance on things, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1416.2s)]
*  and they don't have enough skepticism that in fact, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1419.28s)]
*  the emperor has no clothes, right? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1423.6799999999998s)]
*  And you've gotta bring that perspective. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1425.84s)]
*  They're weak inside, is what you're saying, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1429.56s)]
*  a lot of these people. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1431.56s)]
*  I do think that's the case. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1432.52s)]
*  And from the standpoint of the IC, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1435.04s)]
*  the other thing that they would do is they would keep you [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1437.72s)]
*  from being briefed, right? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1440.58s)]
*  The briefing, we've already discussed [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1442.8799999999999s)]
*  what the brief is, and sometimes what President Trump [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1444.2s)]
*  is saying, I'm not gonna necessarily get the brief, right? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1448.16s)]
*  But I would find that I wasn't read into certain things [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1450.8s)]
*  until they needed my signature. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1455.16s)]
*  So once they needed some reason to get my signature, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1457.8s)]
*  then all of a sudden I get this brief, right? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1460.88s)]
*  And that's not the way it should be. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1463.16s)]
*  If you're trying to provide oversight and accountability, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1466.02s)]
*  you don't know what you don't know, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1469.4s)]
*  and so you have to be able to have the whole entire [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1471.4s)]
*  landscape of things that you could, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1477.96s)]
*  oh, that's interesting. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1479.8000000000002s)]
*  We should do something that President Trump [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1481.72s)]
*  wouldn't like that. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1483.2800000000002s)]
*  And I find that was very restrictive unless they needed me. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1484.52s)]
*  And so I basically said, look, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1487.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna, you are not getting my signature [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1489.0s)]
*  unless you get me briefed up. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1492.44s)]
*  And I want access to all of these things that I need [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1494.0600000000002s)]
*  to be able to provide oversight for the federal government. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1497.5800000000002s)]
*  And one of the things that we did, Tucker, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1500.68s)]
*  is that since the rise of OMB, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1502.88s)]
*  that ability to turn funding on and off [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1507.8000000000002s)]
*  had always been done by a career individual, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1510.8400000000001s)]
*  not a political appointee. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1513.8000000000002s)]
*  And so we changed that. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1515.88s)]
*  And it was like the world was gonna end. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1517.5400000000002s)]
*  They said, look, you're gonna destroy the agency. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1520.94s)]
*  You can't handle the bandwidth. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1523.76s)]
*  You can't handle the bandwidth? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1528.2s)]
*  Chaos will be unmatched. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1529.6s)]
*  And we changed it. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1532.6799999999998s)]
*  And next thing you know, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1533.84s)]
*  everything's flowing across our desk. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1534.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1536.6s)]
*  We're not doing that. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1537.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, it was just amazing. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1538.76s)]
*  And if you don't know and have that thesis that says, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1540.24s)]
*  this is what must be done, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1543.24s)]
*  you could be the most incredible conservative in the world. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1545.1999999999998s)]
*  You could be the most policy consistent person [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1548.26s)]
*  with the president, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1551.4599999999998s)]
*  but you don't know how to put your hand in the glove [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1552.6s)]
*  and use that agency for the president's behalf. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1555.6s)]
*  The president's not gonna be able [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1560.24s)]
*  to be well served at that agency. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1561.3999999999999s)]
*  I saw David Ignatius, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1563.52s)]
*  who was a long time water carrier for the CIA. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1565.8s)]
*  I don't know if they're paying him, but they should be, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1568.6799999999998s)]
*  because he does their bidding [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1571.24s)]
*  and has for decades at the Washington Post. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1572.1599999999999s)]
*  And I heard him saying yesterday [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1573.8s)]
*  that we can't have Tulsi Gabbard at DNI, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1575.6399999999999s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1579.6s)]
*  because it will cause quote chaos, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1580.7199999999998s)]
*  because the intel community doesn't like her. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1583.12s)]
*  And basically he's making the argument [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1585.7199999999998s)]
*  that we should not have civilian control of these agencies [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1587.04s)]
*  because the agencies won't like it. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1589.4399999999998s)]
*  Just say it, that's what you really mean. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1591.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, I think that's basically what he's saying. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1592.6399999999999s)]
*  So that's, again, that's dictatorship [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1594.56s)]
*  is what he's describing, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1597.6799999999998s)]
*  but he used chaos as kind of the threat. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1598.6799999999998s)]
*  Okay, but you've been there. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1606.4399999999998s)]
*  If you really did everything that was needed [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1608.4799999999998s)]
*  in order to root out the corruption [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1612.96s)]
*  that defines our government, you will cause some chaos. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1614.64s)]
*  You would, wouldn't you? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1617.8400000000001s)]
*  You will certainly read on the papers like chaos. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1620.04s)]
*  That's good, fair. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1623.08s)]
*  As to what just is normal good government behind the scenes, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1624.3600000000001s)]
*  managing, pushing, pushing through whatever. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1628.88s)]
*  I think it can be done very wisely [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1633.28s)]
*  and done in a way that, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1637.48s)]
*  anyone who had a bird's eye view into that [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1641.08s)]
*  would be able to say, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1643.08s)]
*  that's exactly what we put this administration into office. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1644.04s)]
*  But yeah, you're gonna have to kick over people's paradigms. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1646.6399999999999s)]
*  You're gonna have to kick over people's turfs. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1650.24s)]
*  You're gonna have to change people's understanding [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1652.6s)]
*  of things that they have invested their whole life [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1654.52s)]
*  into a view of the world. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1657.12s)]
*  And none of this is, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1659.56s)]
*  their views of the world aren't rooted in the constitution [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1660.84s)]
*  and in some cases, any version of the facts, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1663.76s)]
*  but that's gonna cause a lot of turmoil [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1668.32s)]
*  within these bureaucracies and you gotta fight through it. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1672.12s)]
*  And then they're gonna overlay the aspect of, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1674.44s)]
*  oh my gosh, you guys are racist and you guys, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1676.6399999999999s)]
*  nobody cares about us as people. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1679.84s)]
*  You're gonna have to deal with that too, right? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1682.04s)]
*  They are, one of the arguments that they're using [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1684.76s)]
*  in the press against me right now, as they say, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1687.8799999999999s)]
*  he called for trauma within the bureaucracies. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1690.4s)]
*  Yeah, I called for trauma within the bureaucracies. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1693.8s)]
*  Bureaucracies hate the American people. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1696.72s)]
*  They wanna put a 70-70 year old [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1699.4s)]
*  and did a 70-70 year old Navy veteran in jail [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1701.24s)]
*  for 18 months for building four ponds on his ranch [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1704.4s)]
*  to fight wildfires. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1707.44s)]
*  That's not the Department of Justice, that's the EPA. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1708.88s)]
*  You go every agency and it's not just big government, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1711.52s)]
*  it's weaponized against the country. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1714.28s)]
*  Of course. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1716.56s)]
*  And so yeah, we would want to provide trauma [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1717.4s)]
*  against that bureaucracy in a way [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1721.08s)]
*  that frees the American people from the people [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1723.4s)]
*  that have assumed the type of power [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1725.6s)]
*  that the Constitution and no law, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1729.52s)]
*  no public debate ever gave them. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1731.24s)]
*  Does that mean we dislike everyone working [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1733.24s)]
*  at federal agencies and want them to have a bad life? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1735.1599999999999s)]
*  No, of course. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1737.48s)]
*  There's a lot of people there who have come to serve [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1738.6799999999998s)]
*  and do great public service and we wanna affirm that [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1740.8s)]
*  and we wanna turn over the bureaucracies [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1744.28s)]
*  that are traumatizing the American people. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1747.04s)]
*  Yeah, and the outcomes are terrible [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1749.28s)]
*  and they're terrible because it's corrupt. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1750.76s)]
*  That's why it doesn't change. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1751.9599999999998s)]
*  And the DC metro area is the richest in the country [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1753.2s)]
*  and they don't make anything. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1756.8400000000001s)]
*  So it's just like, that's the most obvious marker [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1757.76s)]
*  for corruption that I can imagine. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1759.72s)]
*  Tell us about what congressional confirmation hearings [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1763.32s)]
*  are gonna look like for Trump's appointees. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1769.0s)]
*  They're gonna be exhilarating [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1772.3600000000001s)]
*  if you have the right approach, Tom. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1777.0800000000002s)]
*  But they're gonna come at everything [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1780.0800000000002s)]
*  that we've got, right? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1782.6s)]
*  Or everything they've got with what they are able [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1785.3999999999999s)]
*  to put someone in the dock and that individual [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1788.36s)]
*  is gonna have to face the balance of wanting [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1792.12s)]
*  to defend everything that they have done in life and belief. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1795.04s)]
*  And at the same time, the thing that's a little hard about [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1800.1999999999998s)]
*  is you're no longer yourself, right? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1804.0s)]
*  You are yourself, but you are also going to do a job [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1806.8s)]
*  for a person. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1809.4399999999998s)]
*  So what I think about a particular issue doesn't mean [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1810.28s)]
*  as much as what the president thinks [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1814.24s)]
*  about something like that. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1816.0s)]
*  And so it is a different thing than coming on [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1817.44s)]
*  and doing an interview about what your viewpoints [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1821.3999999999999s)]

*  No, that's exactly what I'm saying. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1824.68s)]
*  It's not a cable news head. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1825.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1826.96s)]
*  No. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1827.8s)]
*  So, but I think, look, I've had experience, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1828.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, Bernie Sanders went after me very, very hard [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1831.84s)]
*  in my first confirmation hearing as deputy OMB [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1835.52s)]
*  for essentially believing in John 316. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1839.24s)]
*  And it was- [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1842.84s)]
*  Wait, he hit you, he attacked you on the basis [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1845.24s)]
*  of your religious beliefs? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1847.68s)]
*  He said I was a bigot and I should not serve [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1849.16s)]
*  in the federal government because of my Christian faith [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1852.0s)]
*  and believing something that essentially comes down [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1854.1200000000001s)]
*  to what's articulated at sports games with John 316. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1856.0s)]
*  And that was most- [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1859.76s)]
*  Who's the bigot? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1863.52s)]
*  Who is the bigger, right? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1864.96s)]
*  That's the perfect question that goes back. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1865.96s)]
*  Most nominees will not go through what I went through, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1868.88s)]
*  but I will tell them you will get through it. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1871.8400000000001s)]
*  You will get to the other side [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1874.96s)]
*  and it will be the most freeing thing in the world. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1876.48s)]
*  You will come at through the end of a process like that. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1878.56s)]
*  And you will, I find it to be at that point exhilarating [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1881.1200000000001s)]
*  because it prepares you to take on an enemy fire. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1884.76s)]
*  Where are they gonna, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1888.4s)]
*  are you afraid of being calling you bigot, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1889.24s)]
*  racist, Christian nationalist, authoritarian? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1890.96s)]
*  If you are not afraid of these attacks [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1895.04s)]
*  and you give them no credence, no credibility, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1898.8799999999999s)]
*  then you will be able to get through these things. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1902.1599999999999s)]
*  You will be able to convince enough senators [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1905.32s)]
*  and you'll be able to serve [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1909.28s)]
*  and you'll be served more effectively. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1910.48s)]
*  But the bright lights will be on [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1912.08s)]
*  in these confirmation hearings. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1915.1599999999999s)]
*  So how much of it is theatrical and how much of it is real? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1916.36s)]
*  So you go into a hearing like that, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1921.36s)]
*  your confirmation hearing, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1923.68s)]
*  do you know the outcome at the beginning [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1925.4s)]
*  or do you think that votes really change [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1927.16s)]
*  based on the testimony of nominees? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1928.9s)]
*  I don't think most votes change at all. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1930.92s)]
*  I think that you may have one or two anomaly senators [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1933.2s)]
*  that are trying to, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1936.64s)]
*  have you answered something to their satisfaction [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1937.8000000000002s)]
*  or are they're trying to get a feel for you [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1940.76s)]
*  that they haven't otherwise? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1943.6000000000001s)]
*  But I think increasingly in the partisan world [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1944.92s)]
*  that we live in, the Democrats are voting no. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1948.48s)]
*  And it's a matter of making sure you've convinced [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1952.24s)]
*  and you've brought in the- [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1955.44s)]
*  So you get no, I mean, what's interesting- [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1956.28s)]
*  I get no Democrat votes. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1958.0s)]
*  But the Republicans are always voting for the, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1960.24s)]
*  I mean, Lindsey Graham will vote for any Democrat. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1962.84s)]
*  Sorry, I'm not gonna put you in an uncomfortable situation, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1964.88s)]
*  but there are plenty of Republican senators [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1966.88s)]
*  who are liberal Democrats effectively [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1969.24s)]
*  and they vote for all kinds of nominees, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1971.48s)]
*  but you don't see that on the other side. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1973.92s)]
*  You never see that on the other side. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1975.32s)]
*  And they have an appreciation [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1976.8s)]
*  that they have to attack our people at every level [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1979.1399999999999s)]
*  because they know that every level [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1983.5s)]
*  is the stepping stone for- [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1985.1399999999999s)]
*  The next level. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1986.58s)]
*  Exactly, right? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1987.3999999999999s)]
*  So they don't make as a, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1988.24s)]
*  oh, this is just like the undersecretary. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1989.3s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1990.8999999999999s)]
*  No, we're opposed to that. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1992.26s)]
*  That guy will be secretary someday. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1993.8999999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1995.06s)]
*  Well, you're probably, I guess, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1995.8999999999999s)]
*  a perfect example, aren't you? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1996.7199999999998s)]
*  Well, certainly the first term, right? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=1997.9399999999998s)]
*  I become deputy and next thing you know, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2000.6999999999998s)]
*  Mix goes to the chief of staff [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2003.26s)]
*  and so I have an opportunity to serve as deputy, as director. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2004.78s)]
*  And so that is, they understand government [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2007.1s)]
*  and they understand the career path [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2011.6599999999999s)]
*  that is opening for people. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2013.3799999999999s)]
*  And they, when they sense, and it's not always the case, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2016.5s)]
*  but when they sense that this is a committed conservative, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2019.1799999999998s)]

*  Isn't it the role of Republican leaders, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2093.48s)]
*  particularly now, since Trump won the majority [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2095.56s)]
*  of the popular vote, overwhelming majority [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2097.56s)]
*  of electoral votes, House and Senate are Republican, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2099.96s)]
*  majority of state houses, majority of governorships, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2103.8s)]
*  that's a mandate. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2105.8s)]

*  the two head guys in the House and Senate, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2110.4s)]

*  and he's dealing with a Senate that won't move quickly [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2165.68s)]
*  enough to be able to install his people [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2167.88s)]
*  so that he can actually function as a government, right? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2170.4s)]
*  That it's specifically mapped out, and yet you have- [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2172.8s)]
*  So in the Constitution, so it's by definition [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2176.52s)]
*  not a constitutional fair? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2178.8s)]
*  Fair. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2180.5600000000004s)]
*  So you have Republicans, one of them in particular, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2181.38s)]
*  like Ed Whelan right now, who's attacking Trump [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2184.84s)]
*  for even mentioning- [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2187.48s)]
*  Who's Ed Whelan? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2188.6800000000003s)]
*  He writes one, he's one of the main kind of legal [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2190.7200000000003s)]
*  luminaries on the right, and ethics and public policy [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2194.2000000000003s)]
*  are one of those think tanks. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2198.4s)]
*  And he's out there opposing the whole notion [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2199.92s)]
*  of recess appointments for whatever reason I don't know, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2201.96s)]
*  other than he thinks it's unseemly [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2207.2400000000002s)]
*  and not the way the Founding- [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2209.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay, so don't, I mean, this is a whole separate question, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2210.32s)]
*  and it's a broad brush, but in general, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2213.36s)]
*  conservative think tanks, with some exceptions, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2216.36s)]
*  are not conservative, they're tools of the left, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2218.94s)]
*  and sort of repositories have broke down people [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2221.96s)]
*  with no other job prospects. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2224.64s)]
*  Why would anyone pay attention to them? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2226.6s)]
*  I think they should increasingly not be, right? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2229.12s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, there's some good ones, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2231.28s)]
*  and I love Kevin Roberts and Heritage, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2232.48s)]
*  and there are good people in some think tanks for sure, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2235.24s)]
*  but in general, it's like the world of Jonah Goldberg, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2237.36s)]
*  it's like, who cares what you think? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2239.64s)]
*  They only matter to the extent that people in the arena [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2241.76s)]
*  listen to them, and that is increasingly [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2245.08s)]
*  they are not being listened to, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2247.56s)]
*  and I think that's part of one of the reasons [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2248.76s)]
*  why they're so up-arms about it, right? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2250.12s)]
*  I mean, National Review itself is that phenomenon. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2251.84s)]
*  National Review, that was a magazine in the 50s, right? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2255.92s)]
*  Right, and I think that's, but my point is, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2258.6s)]
*  the extent to which people have opposed Trump [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2262.08s)]
*  and the America First agenda, I think ultimately [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2265.0s)]
*  is a loss of power, because they didn't get [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2268.48s)]
*  to set the agenda, they don't get to be the traffic cop, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2271.56s)]
*  they don't get to kind of say, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2275.0s)]
*  oh, this offends my sensibility and more, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2276.3199999999997s)]
*  and no, if you have a radical constitutionalism, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2278.7999999999997s)]
*  and that's really what I've been calling for, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2283.08s)]
*  given this crazy unconstitutional situation [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2285.2s)]
*  that we're finding ourselves in, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2288.3199999999997s)]
*  if you have a radical constitutionalism, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2290.28s)]
*  it's gonna be destabilizing. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2292.2000000000003s)]
*  You may find that you can use the, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2293.6800000000003s)]
*  James Madison could have put a whole lot more [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2295.6000000000004s)]
*  recess appointments in than you would have ever imagined, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2297.6000000000004s)]
*  but it's also exhilarating, and why, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2300.6800000000003s)]
*  if you're trying to preserve the country, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2303.5600000000004s)]
*  would you make arguments against that? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2304.96s)]
*  Why wouldn't you be making arguments for it? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2307.1200000000003s)]
*  So that's one of the reasons we just put out [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2309.1600000000003s)]
*  a five-page paper, we'll put out a 40-page paper next [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2311.0400000000004s)]
*  as to this is the constitutional grounds [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2313.76s)]
*  for recess appointments of, we haven't just, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2316.28s)]
*  President Trump hasn't decided to do it, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2318.52s)]
*  but if he does, he will be in the same vein as our founders. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2320.12s)]
*  It's a little weird, and again, you haven't, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2324.56s)]
*  well, as of right now, so it's November 18th, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2327.64s)]
*  you've not been nominated. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2330.52s)]
*  No. Yeah. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2331.52s)]
*  I think you will be, hope so, but you haven't been, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2332.48s)]
*  so I don't wanna put you in an awkward spot, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2335.56s)]
*  because if you are, you're gonna have to deal with this, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2337.92s)]
*  but why would Mitch McConnell, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2339.4s)]
*  still the Senate leader of Republicans, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2341.0s)]
*  why would he say we're not doing recess appointments? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2344.16s)]
*  Again, I haven't spoken to Senator McConnell on it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2347.76s)]
*  My guess is that the Senate is going to want [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2351.6000000000004s)]
*  to know the argument, and they probably have been told, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2354.32s)]
*  and may have been told, and I'm gonna just keep it [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2359.48s)]
*  as positive as possible that this is inappropriate. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2362.6000000000004s)]
*  You can't do it, and I want to show them, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2366.5600000000004s)]
*  and no, in fact, you can. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2369.48s)]
*  It is entirely appropriate, and to win the argument, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2371.5200000000004s)]
*  and then if you win the argument, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2375.2s)]
*  and then people are just like, no, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2376.7999999999997s)]
*  well, you don't wanna do this, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2378.0s)]
*  then it's a different matter, right? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2378.92s)]
*  It's like, it just kind of reveals [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2380.3599999999997s)]
*  that they're not actually on board [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2384.04s)]
*  with those particular nominees going into office, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2385.56s)]
*  and that's a different issue. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2388.6s)]
*  So I think that we don't know yet to whether, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2391.68s)]
*  will the Senate have an issue? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2395.68s)]
*  I mean, to some extent, the Senate knows it has an issue, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2397.2s)]
*  because they couldn't move these nominees fast enough [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2399.52s)]
*  in the first term, because the Democrats [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2402.3999999999996s)]
*  were filibustering everyone, right? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2404.12s)]
*  And so, and by the way, a lot of these hearings, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2407.16s)]
*  and you read the history books, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2410.52s)]
*  and people got approved by the Senate in a day. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2412.52s)]
*  Like, the system wasn't meant to be this slow, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2415.64s)]
*  and it has been bogged down and slowed down, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2418.6s)]
*  and we'll see, Senator Thune, Majority Leader Thune, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2421.64s)]
*  will have a chance to put his own imprint on the Senate, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2425.7999999999997s)]
*  and I wanna see how he does. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2428.92s)]
*  Yeah, I've got high expectations, low hopes, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2431.2s)]
*  hope I'm wrong. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2434.64s)]
*  It'd be one thing if the outcome was positive, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2436.48s)]
*  if the country was thriving. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2438.56s)]
*  You know, you say, okay, the system's dysfunctional, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2440.3199999999997s)]
*  but you don't really need a lot of change right now, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2442.2s)]
*  so that's fine, but the outcome is not positive at all. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2443.7599999999998s)]
*  It's total destruction of the country we grew up in, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2446.04s)]
*  so gotta fix it. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2448.0s)]
*  Why would you wanna enter back into this? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2449.52s)]
*  Well, you know, I've always said the last four years, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2452.3199999999997s)]
*  I would never wanna miss out on another chance [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2454.9199999999996s)]
*  to be at the president's side. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2457.0s)]
*  I find in him to be someone who's so uniquely situated [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2459.16s)]
*  for the moment, and you go back, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2463.8399999999997s)]
*  and I've done some reading on this, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2465.68s)]
*  you go back and read some of the Federalist papers, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2468.04s)]
*  and they actually designed the system for someone like him, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2470.08s)]
*  whose interests would align with the country's interests [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2473.7999999999997s)]
*  to such an extent to which it actually works. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2478.68s)]
*  Like, separation of powers is meant to have strong, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2484.24s)]
*  opinionated, convictional leadership [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2488.12s)]
*  that go as fast as they can [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2491.56s)]
*  and hard as they can in their direction, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2494.24s)]
*  and for the system to then have [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2496.72s)]
*  true separation of powers, right? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2499.44s)]
*  An example of that is what he's proposing [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2502.08s)]
*  on recess appointments. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2505.52s)]
*  If the Constitution allows you to do it, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2506.56s)]
*  why wouldn't you do it if it's in your interest? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2508.64s)]
*  And then let's see what Congress does in response to that, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2510.7999999999997s)]
*  but that's real separation of powers. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2514.04s)]
*  It's not like this kind of fake, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2515.6s)]
*  fourth branch administrative state where none of it works, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2518.88s)]
*  and it's all kind of cartel behind the scene, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2521.4s)]
*  where all you get is kind of different parts [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2524.04s)]
*  of each of the branch coming together almost as a blob, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2526.88s)]
*  and I think he's so unique in terms of being [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2531.4s)]
*  a historical transformative person [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2535.48s)]
*  that we can actually save the country, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2538.6s)]
*  and that's really what it comes down to. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2540.8399999999997s)]
*  The hour's late, it's 11.59, it's not too late, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2543.72s)]
*  but it's really late, and this isn't an election [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2548.8399999999997s)]
*  where you can just have seesaws. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2551.08s)]
*  We'll be up and you'll be down. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2552.3599999999997s)]
*  No, if we don't win, and he's won an electoral mandate, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2554.72s)]
*  now it's time to actually execute. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2559.8399999999997s)]
*  If we don't execute, we may never have this chance again, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2561.4399999999996s)]
*  and so you have the president who's ready to go. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2566.3599999999997s)]
*  Now you need know-how people who can do that [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2568.9199999999996s)]
*  and do it with the attacks that are coming, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2572.08s)]
*  and they will come, right? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2575.08s)]
*  They will come hardest at the people [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2576.96s)]
*  that they believe are the greatest threats, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2580.18s)]
*  and but that's what the president needs. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2583.36s)]
*  The president needs those types of people [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2586.2799999999997s)]
*  where he's not gonna be successful [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2588.7599999999998s)]
*  and the country won't be saved, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2590.24s)]
*  and I just, I think that it's incumbent on those of us [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2591.92s)]
*  who have that skill set, who have had the experiences [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2594.68s)]
*  we've had, we're put here for a reason. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2599.96s)]
*  We're here because God has given us a particular purpose [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2602.8799999999997s)]
*  for a particular time, and it's incumbent us [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2606.6s)]
*  to be responsible with those moments that we're given. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2609.0s)]
*  So I don't know what the future holds. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2611.24s)]
*  I don't know if I serve or if I continue at my center [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2612.72s)]
*  to be championing the ideas that he's working on. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2615.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm happy with both of those scenarios, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2618.8799999999997s)]
*  but it's incumbent on us to give everything we can [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2621.7599999999998s)]
*  to be successful in this moment, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2626.52s)]
*  because I don't think we will get another moment like this. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2628.08s)]
*  And if you doubt how serious the opposition is [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2631.3199999999997s)]
*  to the public, not just to Trump, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2634.4s)]
*  but to the majority of the country that voted for Trump, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2635.96s)]
*  they're trying to leave him with World War III [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2638.92s)]
*  on the way out. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2641.0s)]
*  I can't imagine a more desperate or evil thing [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2642.4s)]
*  for Tony Blinken, who I think is desperate and evil, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2646.2799999999997s)]
*  in my view, to do, leave him with a war? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2648.92s)]
*  A lame duck president trying to start a war [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2653.5s)]
*  with the world's largest nuclear power, Russia. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2655.56s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2658.36s)]
*  It's incredibly insidious, and then add to the fact [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2661.0s)]
*  that he can't put two sentences together, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2665.52s)]
*  and he's largely not in control of his own government. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2667.52s)]
*  And so you have almost an unelected president [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2670.84s)]
*  with individuals behind the scenes that are doing this. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2675.16s)]
*  It doesn't surprise me, though. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2679.8s)]
*  I mean, these are the same people [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2681.12s)]
*  that have weaponized the Department of Justice, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2682.36s)]
*  the law fair. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2686.32s)]
*  I have a colleague of mine, Jeff Clark, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2687.1600000000003s)]
*  who's, you know, they're trying to disbar him [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2689.1600000000003s)]
*  because of the care that he had on behalf of the president [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2692.4s)]
*  to deal with voter integrity and election fraud after 2020. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2696.2000000000003s)]
*  And so the system has thrown everything [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2700.08s)]
*  at the warriors that are on the field. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2702.44s)]
*  You've seen that with Tulsi, you've seen that with Matt Gaetz. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2704.86s)]
*  I mean, why is all of this stuff being thrown at him, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2707.8s)]
*  slanderously? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2712.16s)]
*  Can I just say, I thought, I'm sorry to digress, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2713.2s)]
*  but since you mentioned Gaetz, we don't accuse, look, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2715.96s)]
*  DOJ leaked that he was a child sex trafficker, okay? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2722.12s)]
*  So at that point, they have a moral, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2727.3199999999997s)]
*  I would say legal obligation to charge him [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2729.08s)]
*  for child sex trafficking and prove it in court, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2731.06s)]
*  and if they can't, shut the F up. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2733.12s)]
*  But they didn't do that. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2735.2799999999997s)]
*  They did not. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2736.2s)]
*  They leaked that Matt Gaetz, a guy they didn't like, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2737.04s)]
*  whose views were a threat to them, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2739.56s)]
*  is a child sex trafficker. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2741.92s)]
*  Then they just let it hang in the air [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2744.22s)]
*  and all their repulsive little minions like Joe Scarborough, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2746.0s)]
*  like he's a child sex trafficker. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2748.52s)]
*  You wanna live in a world where the secret police [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2750.24s)]
*  can just slander you through the media? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2752.08s)]
*  I read in my Bible this morning [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2755.98s)]
*  that you don't believe something [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2757.32s)]
*  unless two or three people are witnesses and say, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2758.4s)]
*  and there is none of that, in fact. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2762.16s)]
*  What's mosaic law right there? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2764.04s)]
*  And in fact, the weaponized Department of Justice said, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2765.7999999999997s)]
*  we don't have the proof to pursue these allegations. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2769.4s)]
*  I know! [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2772.64s)]
*  And so then you read in the story. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2773.48s)]
*  But they accused him of it. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2774.88s)]
*  They accuse it, they make the case, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2776.1600000000003s)]
*  the reporter said, read it this morning, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2778.36s)]
*  and then they say, it should be known [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2780.2400000000002s)]
*  that Matt Gaetz denies that these allegations have occurred. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2781.98s)]
*  Of course he denies it, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2785.04s)]
*  because they're not true in the Department of Justice. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2786.1600000000003s)]
*  There's no accounting of the fact [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2787.7200000000003s)]
*  that these things have been proven not to be true, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2789.7200000000003s)]
*  and yet people, and there's a tendency on our side, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2792.08s)]
*  and this is very troubling. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2794.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not just the left, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2796.24s)]
*  which is kind of state regime propaganda. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2798.2s)]
*  There's a tendency on our side to believe [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2801.08s)]
*  that if there's smoke, there must be fire. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2804.04s)]
*  Why do we do that? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2806.3799999999997s)]
*  Why does our side, why does Republican congressmen, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2808.7999999999997s)]
*  Republican senators believe [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2812.14s)]
*  that where there must be smoke, there must be fire, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2814.4399999999996s)]
*  only because this person has been a confrontational, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2818.12s)]
*  courageous, conviction leader [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2821.72s)]
*  in a true generational talent, I might add. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2824.4s)]
*  The last point is indisputable, that's just a fact. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2829.76s)]
*  I mean, Gaetz is the most articulate member of Congress. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2832.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not something close, right? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2834.64s)]
*  So they hate him for that, because he's a danger. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2836.44s)]
*  My explanation, of course I've noticed that, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2839.2400000000002s)]
*  Republicans believe most of what they're told. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2841.82s)]
*  Part of it is, I think there's an IQ gap, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2844.92s)]
*  if I'm just being honest. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2847.12s)]
*  Part of it is they believe in the system, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2848.86s)]
*  and Democrats just don't believe in the system at all. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2851.32s)]
*  They don't believe in any system [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2853.52s)]
*  that curtails their power, basically. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2855.36s)]
*  But Republicans really believe in it, to their great credit. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2857.86s)]
*  And so they're like, well, it's the DOJ. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2860.64s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of corrupt on the margins, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2862.32s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2864.52s)]
*  There's some bad apples, but most of them are really great. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2865.34s)]
*  Really? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2867.2400000000002s)]
*  Why haven't the great ones resigned? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2868.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2869.56s)]
*  I don't think there's any evidence [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2870.4s)]
*  they're mostly great at all. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2871.64s)]
*  I think they're really dangerous, heavily armed. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2872.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe that's the answer? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2876.0s)]
*  I think that is fundamental, it's twofold. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2877.68s)]
*  I think the left is made up of revolutionaries. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2880.56s)]
*  For sure. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2884.04s)]
*  And they're Marxist, when if you've read Witness, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2884.88s)]
*  everyone knows that, right? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2887.7599999999998s)]
*  That's not a new phenomena, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2889.56s)]
*  it's become militarized over and over. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2891.84s)]
*  Witness was written in 1955. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2894.7999999999997s)]
*  Correct, right. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2896.56s)]
*  So now what that looks like is not someone [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2897.4s)]
*  who's a behind-the-scenes spy, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2900.04s)]
*  now that looks like some of their members of Congress, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2902.38s)]
*  like an AOC. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2906.08s)]
*  Their Marxist revolutionaries are voting in Congress. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2907.96s)]
*  So that's their side, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2911.32s)]
*  and our side doesn't really grapple with that. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2913.04s)]
*  We don't make every decision realizing [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2915.12s)]
*  that's what they think and that's what they're doing, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2917.76s)]
*  so I'm not gonna listen to what they just, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2919.92s)]
*  kind of chit chat conversation. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2922.12s)]
*  I'm going to govern and make decisions [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2923.88s)]
*  based on what I know they are pursuing. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2926.44s)]
*  Know your enemy. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2928.66s)]
*  Secondly, we do have trust in kind of the media [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2930.18s)]
*  and the institutions like Tony Fauci can't be lying, right? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2935.2999999999997s)]
*  It can't really, he must not have been doing [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2940.7799999999997s)]
*  gain-of-function research if he said he wasn't. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2944.1s)]
*  He's Tony Fauci, right? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2946.8199999999997s)]
*  Like that's what we were up against. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2948.58s)]
*  And that is the wrong approach. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2950.06s)]
*  You gotta have a skepticism of all of these people [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2954.7799999999997s)]
*  and their institutions and their bureaucracies. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2957.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay, what needs to be done? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2961.2200000000003s)]
*  And just, I'll shut up. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2966.26s)]
*  I'll stop with my stupid editorial comments. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2968.42s)]
*  You just go through the top three or four things [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2970.06s)]
*  that you think this incoming administration, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2973.06s)]
*  which has a rare mandate, should achieve in order. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2976.34s)]
*  I believe that there's a lot of policy issues downstream, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2979.94s)]
*  the border, inflation, wars across the world, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2984.52s)]
*  all of them are downstream of one reality, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2989.18s)]
*  and that is we don't, the American people currently [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2993.5s)]
*  are not in control of their government [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2996.62s)]
*  and the president hasn't been either. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=2998.18s)]
*  And so we have to solve that. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3000.02s)]
*  We have to solve the woke and the weaponized bureaucracy [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3003.18s)]
*  and have the president take control [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3006.22s)]
*  of the executive branch. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3008.48s)]
*  So my belief, for anyone who wants to listen, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3010.14s)]
*  is that you have to, the president has to move [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3012.94s)]
*  as executively as fast and as aggressively as possible [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3016.42s)]
*  with a radical constitutional perspective [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3021.7400000000002s)]
*  to be able to dismantle that bureaucracy [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3024.82s)]
*  in their power centers. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3027.94s)]
*  And I think there are a couple of ways to do it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3029.26s)]
*  Number one is going after the whole notion of independence. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3030.88s)]
*  There are no independent agencies. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3034.82s)]
*  Congress may have viewed them as such, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3036.86s)]
*  SEC or the FCC, CFPB, the whole alphabet soup, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3038.6600000000003s)]
*  but that is not something that the constitution understands. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3044.1s)]
*  So there may be different strategies with each one of them [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3049.22s)]
*  about how you dismantle them, but as an administration, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3051.58s)]
*  the whole notion of an independent agency [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3055.7s)]
*  should be thrown out, particularly with the Department [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3057.2999999999997s)]
*  of Justice, in which there's literally no law. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3059.62s)]
*  All it is is precedent from the Watergate era [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3062.72s)]
*  that the attorney general and those lawyers [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3066.02s)]
*  don't work for the president. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3069.66s)]
*  And- [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3071.58s)]
*  They think that they work for themselves. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3073.1800000000003s)]
*  They think that they are- [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3075.54s)]
*  So they have the power to kill people [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3076.38s)]
*  just because they awarded themselves that power? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3078.1s)]
*  They have the power to kill people. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3080.1800000000003s)]
*  They believe that they have the power [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3081.62s)]
*  for all of the prosecutions and that the president [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3083.26s)]
*  doesn't get a say in any of that. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3088.3s)]
*  And we have to go at that as hard as we possibly can, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3090.42s)]
*  whether that's the military. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3095.02s)]
*  We have a whole military industrial complex of generals, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3096.58s)]
*  and Tommy Tuberville kind of exposed this, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3100.14s)]
*  last year, with a fight about life, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3103.02s)]
*  but it really became a fight about whether we have [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3104.7s)]
*  a essentially a military that is not subject [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3108.58s)]
*  to civilian leadership. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3113.58s)]
*  So you can apply the concept of destroying independence [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3115.02s)]
*  at every agency. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3119.5s)]
*  I even saw it in aspects of OMB with regard to who gets [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3120.62s)]
*  to make the decisions on statistics, right? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3123.8599999999997s)]
*  Like there are little pockets of independence [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3127.2999999999997s)]
*  that have to be just, we gotta remove those, right? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3129.78s)]
*  They're unconstitutional. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3134.26s)]
*  Number two- [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3135.7400000000002s)]
*  Would you include the Fed in that list? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3136.5800000000004s)]
*  So I am not a huge fan of the Fed. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3139.2200000000003s)]
*  I can't look at the Constitution and the massive [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3142.3s)]
*  decades-long decisions that they have made [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3148.42s)]
*  totally undemocratic and see that that is a place [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3150.7400000000002s)]
*  where there deserves to be an exception for the Fed. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3155.78s)]
*  I don't even understand who controls the Fed. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3158.34s)]
*  I mean, and where does their authority come from? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3161.02s)]
*  God? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3162.78s)]
*  Are they speaking directly to God? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3163.6200000000003s)]
*  Like what is this? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3165.02s)]
*  No, because they're wrong, and they've been wrong [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3166.1000000000004s)]
*  for decades, right? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3168.82s)]
*  Right, let's go to zero interest rates for 11 years, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3170.2200000000003s)]
*  see what happens. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3172.1000000000004s)]
*  And see what happens. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3172.94s)]
*  So President Trump hasn't run on that, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3173.76s)]
*  and so I'm not gonna speak- [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3175.7000000000003s)]
*  But I'm just interested as you've looked into the question [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3177.46s)]
*  of what authority does the Constitution bestow onto whom. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3180.1800000000003s)]
*  No, and to give you an example, if you go on TV, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3183.86s)]
*  if you were watching news, you're gonna have seen [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3185.98s)]
*  in the last two years ads saying oppose the Fed's [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3189.2200000000003s)]
*  regulations on capital, bank capital, right? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3194.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, who are they supposed to call? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3198.7000000000003s)]
*  They're not calling their congressman. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3200.98s)]
*  Congressman has no power. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3203.1400000000003s)]
*  The issue is like the call to action is against the Fed. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3204.86s)]
*  Well, sorry, you're kind of out of luck in the- [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3208.82s)]
*  What's the lever we would use to influence the Fed? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3211.2200000000003s)]
*  There is no lever, right? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3213.3s)]
*  And so they have existed with this notion [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3215.1s)]
*  that they have this priestly ability to make decisions. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3218.66s)]
*  And in fact, I don't actually think [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3222.72s)]
*  they're that good at it. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3224.5s)]
*  I think people like President Trump [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3225.82s)]
*  are in fact better at it. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3227.2599999999998s)]
*  And there's no reason that they should be exempt [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3229.22s)]
*  from the normal democratic process. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3233.2999999999997s)]
*  And if Congress wants to come along and pass rules, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3236.34s)]
*  it says, you know, this is how we want [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3238.82s)]
*  the money supply to go. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3240.2599999999998s)]
*  All of that is in their purview, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3241.9s)]
*  but I think this is not some exception to the rule. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3243.34s)]
*  Doesn't mean in any way that President Trump [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3247.38s)]
*  has any interest in doing anything in this area, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3249.56s)]
*  but I don't think it's the exception [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3252.26s)]
*  that proves the rule on independence [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3254.6200000000003s)]
*  being something that is important downstream [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3257.44s)]
*  to the CDC, the NIH. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3260.06s)]
*  I think everything that people like Bobby Kennedy [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3262.3s)]
*  have been running on and others is about, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3264.38s)]
*  no, you're not some priestly role. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3267.06s)]
*  You are politicians yourself. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3269.42s)]
*  You just don't have to face voters, right? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3270.94s)]
*  So independence is, I think, first and foremost. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3273.36s)]
*  Number two, bring back the notion of impoundment. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3276.36s)]
*  And this is something that- [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3279.34s)]
*  Of what? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3280.54s)]
*  Of impoundment. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3281.38s)]
*  The ability to not spend money. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3282.28s)]
*  For 200 years, presidents had the ability [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3284.2200000000003s)]
*  to not spend a congressional appropriation. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3287.28s)]
*  That has always been the constitutional system. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3290.54s)]
*  It had been brought, it had been a paradigm [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3292.78s)]
*  that had been brought from the UK and how we understood. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3294.98s)]
*  The constitutional principle is certainly [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3298.8399999999997s)]
*  how the purse means that Congress gets to set the ceiling. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3301.52s)]
*  You can't spend without a congressional appropriation, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3304.7599999999998s)]
*  but you weren't ever meant to be forced to spend it [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3307.54s)]
*  and it has become a floor. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3310.16s)]
*  So 200 years, presidents are using impoundment. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3312.04s)]
*  They get money for something. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3314.96s)]
*  The president says, I don't think it's a good idea, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3316.4s)]
*  or I certainly can do it better, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3318.56s)]
*  or I have events that are happening overseas [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3319.92s)]
*  that caused me not to want to spend on the gunboat [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3322.04s)]
*  when I want to get some treaty done. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3325.0s)]
*  All manner of executive decision-making [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3328.12s)]
*  that would be a part of that. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3330.64s)]
*  In the 1970s, at the lowest moment of the presidency, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3332.64s)]
*  Congress steps in, and to some extent the courts, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3336.86s)]
*  and they passed the Impoundment Control Act, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3339.7599999999998s)]
*  which was really the Impoundment Elimination Act. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3343.2s)]
*  And from that moment, they had destroyed separation [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3345.6s)]
*  of powers on spending and on fiscal issues. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3350.2s)]
*  But it was beyond that. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3353.7599999999998s)]
*  It wasn't just about dollars and cents. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3354.84s)]
*  It was about control of the bureaucracy. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3356.72s)]
*  So that law effectively meant the executive branch, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3358.3599999999997s)]
*  the president's agencies have to spend every dollar [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3363.04s)]
*  they're sent by the Congress. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3366.7599999999998s)]
*  Correct. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3368.0s)]
*  And I believe, as a budget guy, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3369.4399999999996s)]
*  that was the original sin on why we can't do anything [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3372.3599999999997s)]
*  fiscally from that moment on. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3375.68s)]
*  It's also why we get omnibus bills, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3377.52s)]
*  because if I only need you to get your signature, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3379.16s)]
*  and I lose all of my ability to, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3382.12s)]
*  throughout the rest of the fiscal year, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3384.52s)]
*  to push and pull and not spend [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3387.68s)]
*  and make different decisions, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3389.7599999999998s)]
*  I just gotta get your one signature. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3391.68s)]
*  So I'm gonna put everything in that one bill, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3393.7599999999998s)]
*  thousands of pages, and I'm gonna push it through [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3396.9199999999996s)]
*  at the most, the hardest time for you politically. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3399.3599999999997s)]
*  You might have some diplomatic visit that you're going on. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3402.08s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3404.9199999999996s)]
*  And so impoundment is vitally important, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3405.7599999999998s)]
*  not just to save the country fiscally, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3408.8399999999997s)]
*  it is vitally important to be able [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3411.3199999999997s)]
*  to rest control of the bureaucracy. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3413.0s)]
*  Because when you combine Congress giving the agencies [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3415.1s)]
*  vast authority to interpret the laws that they passed, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3419.14s)]
*  overly broad, make law, essentially. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3422.5s)]
*  Make law, essentially, that has no repercussions [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3424.9s)]
*  on the people who voted it, right? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3427.22s)]
*  They don't have to vote on what the right blend is [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3428.58s)]
*  for ethanol. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3430.7s)]
*  That's right. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3431.54s)]
*  And then you say that your funding is going for Congress, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3433.2599999999998s)]
*  and the president has no ability. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3436.7799999999997s)]
*  Sorry, Mr. President, you don't have to, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3438.74s)]
*  that's illegal, you can't turn off my funding. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3440.42s)]
*  Now, imperial Congress still exists, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3443.62s)]
*  just a lot more subtle. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3446.98s)]
*  So that's number two, bringing back impoundment. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3448.58s)]
*  Number three is dramatically going at restoring [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3451.42s)]
*  at will employment as far as you can. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3456.2599999999998s)]
*  A lot of ideas on the agenda. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3459.18s)]
*  So all these companies are always telling you [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3463.2999999999997s)]
*  how much money they're giving to charity. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3464.5s)]
*  Oh, we're so charitable. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3466.24s)]
*  But what are the charities they're giving to? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3467.74s)]
*  These brands that you buy that you have in your house, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3469.94s)]
*  you don't even wanna know. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3472.34s)]
*  Very often they're charities that don't have the same values [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3473.86s)]
*  that your family has. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3476.54s)]
*  Sometimes they're charities that don't like [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3477.58s)]
*  your family at all. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3479.54s)]
*  But when you use Pure Talk, which is a cell phone company [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3481.1400000000003s)]
*  a lot of us use, you can be certain that your money [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3483.86s)]
*  is going to charities that you yourself would give to. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3486.86s)]
*  Veteran-led companies, for example. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3489.7000000000003s)]
*  To date, Pure Talk has gotten rid of $10 million [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3492.3s)]
*  in debt held by veterans. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3495.7000000000003s)]
*  They've spent tens of thousands more every month [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3497.98s)]
*  to help prevent veteran suicide. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3500.86s)]
*  They just gave 50 grand to Mike Rowe Works, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3502.7000000000003s)]
*  which gives scholarships to veterans learning the trades [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3504.7000000000003s)]
*  after they leave military service, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3506.98s)]
*  So you've seen companies, once again, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3510.6200000000003s)]
*  we're not gonna name names, Bud Light, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3512.1s)]
*  but that do business with Lunatics. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3513.86s)]
*  Again, charities that run contrary to your worldview [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3516.9s)]
*  that despise your worldview. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3520.6600000000003s)]
*  But with Pure Talk, you don't have to worry about that. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3521.82s)]
*  This is a company that supports the causes [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3523.82s)]
*  that you can support. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3525.82s)]
*  Pure Talk gives you the same great cell service [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3527.2200000000003s)]
*  that America's most dependable 5G networks provide [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3529.14s)]
*  for half the cost. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3531.98s)]
*  They also support small businesses [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3533.38s)]
*  with excellent and affordable business plans. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3534.8199999999997s)]
*  They are powering us here at TCN, so we can vouch for it, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3537.14s)]
*  and they can probably save you money too. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3540.98s)]
*  Find out, go to puretalk.com slash Tucker today. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3542.7799999999997s)]
*  Switch to a company that aligns with your values. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3545.9s)]
*  Pure Talk, when you sign up at puretalk.com slash Tucker, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3549.7s)]
*  you get an additional 50% off your first month. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3552.8199999999997s)]
*  We recommend it. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3555.9s)]
*  Well, can we just go back to empowerment [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3556.74s)]
*  really super quick? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3558.2599999999998s)]
*  So what was the idea during Watergate [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3559.1s)]
*  of forcing the president to spend all the money [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3562.38s)]
*  the Congress sends him? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3565.3399999999997s)]
*  Why would you want that? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3566.9s)]
*  You only want it from the standpoint of control [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3568.9s)]
*  if you want to be able to say, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3570.98s)]
*  you're gonna spend what I tell you you're gonna spend. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3572.58s)]
*  It is nothing more than an institutional desire [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3574.98s)]
*  to force the president to spend an X amount of money. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3583.2599999999998s)]
*  But again, it's never just about that. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3586.58s)]
*  It's always about where they have tried to innovate it [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3589.18s)]
*  from really the progressive era. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3592.34s)]
*  They wanted congressional government. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3594.46s)]
*  That was the title of Woodrow Wilson's book. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3596.7s)]
*  He wanted a system where essentially the agencies [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3601.18s)]
*  largely worked out of the Congress [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3605.18s)]
*  or associated with Congress, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3608.58s)]
*  not unlike what you would see in the House of Commons, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3610.06s)]
*  where their cabinet lives in their House of Parliament. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3612.74s)]
*  And it's largely the monarch, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3617.58s)]
*  the executive over times becomes toothless. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3619.7799999999997s)]
*  That's essentially what they have wanted [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3622.7799999999997s)]
*  and have pursued at every turn here. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3624.4199999999996s)]
*  And you saw that on steroids with them using [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3626.9399999999996s)]
*  the events of Watergate to promulgate new paradigms [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3631.66s)]
*  and ways of binding the constitutional system from working. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3635.1s)]
*  So everything post Watergate is largely, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3639.86s)]
*  you can just make an assumption [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3642.86s)]
*  it's not the way it was meant to work. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3643.98s)]
*  And so you have our guys defending post Watergate paradigms [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3645.82s)]
*  instead of trying to think through, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3650.82s)]
*  okay, let's go back. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3652.06s)]
*  Let's go back to what the founders [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3653.78s)]
*  would have actually envisioned. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3655.34s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3656.58s)]
*  Okay, so to your third point, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3658.46s)]
*  thank you for this by the way. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3660.06s)]
*  So to your third point, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3661.38s)]
*  that the president has to be able to fire people [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3663.46s)]
*  who are subverting democracy. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3666.54s)]
*  Why can't he? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3669.5s)]
*  How did federal bureaucrats wind up [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3671.1s)]
*  with a kind of super tenure? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3673.58s)]
*  Where no matter what they do, you can't get rid of them. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3676.5s)]
*  Like I don't understand, they work for the public. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3678.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3681.2599999999998s)]
*  Laws that have been passed, perhaps not challenged. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3682.3s)]
*  The laws that have been passed [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3685.94s)]
*  that give them bargaining power, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3687.22s)]
*  that give them certain processes [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3689.94s)]
*  that have to be followed before they can be dismissed. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3693.14s)]
*  But I think in that, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3696.42s)]
*  and it's certainly made it very, very hard to hire and fire. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3697.9s)]
*  The current system needs to be changed, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3701.38s)]
*  but it also can be used to deal with these same kind [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3705.1s)]
*  of actors if you're willing to do it. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3708.46s)]
*  And I don't wanna get into all of the tools [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3710.1s)]
*  that are available, but they exist. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3713.1s)]
*  One of them is the reduction force. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3715.82s)]
*  I mean, you can, and Vivek has talked about this. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3718.38s)]
*  I mean, you can proceed on the basis of what is good [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3721.06s)]
*  for the efficiency and the effectiveness of the agency [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3725.26s)]
*  to be able to dramatically lower at a macro level [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3729.0600000000004s)]
*  the size of the workforce. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3735.2200000000003s)]
*  And that will give you certain legal abilities [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3737.1800000000003s)]
*  to begin to move people off of the payroll. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3741.2200000000003s)]
*  So there's a lot of things [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3744.5400000000004s)]
*  that are being creatively discussed in this space, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3746.1400000000003s)]
*  but it has to be front and center. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3748.9s)]
*  Schedule F that the President Trump has already run on. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3750.5400000000004s)]
*  That seems to be like a day one thing [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3753.46s)]
*  he has already instituted in his first term. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3755.38s)]
*  We just didn't get to get it across the finish line. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3758.86s)]
*  Every agency has to go and categories how many [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3762.42s)]
*  of his employees are policy [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3765.38s)]
*  and therefore subject to at-will employment. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3768.54s)]
*  I put 90% of OMB in that category [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3770.54s)]
*  because I wanted A, it was true, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3774.2200000000003s)]
*  and B, I wanted to set a high bar [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3777.14s)]
*  for the rest of my colleagues at agency heads [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3779.18s)]
*  that this should be viewed maximally. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3782.34s)]
*  You're willing to fire your own staff, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3784.7000000000003s)]
*  which is another way of saying you're willing [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3786.3s)]
*  to relinquish some power [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3787.86s)]
*  because personnel manpower is power. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3788.98s)]
*  And it's always not just about firing, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3791.2200000000003s)]
*  although there's certainly going to be massive layoffs [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3792.9s)]
*  and firing particularly across some of the agencies [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3795.2200000000003s)]
*  that we don't even think should exist. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3797.58s)]
*  But what I found was that you get better staff work [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3799.5s)]
*  when people are now in their mind realizing, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3802.38s)]
*  okay, I'm not immune from all accountability. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3806.2200000000003s)]
*  And I would tell people, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3809.98s)]
*  you'd have to have these conference calls [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3811.3s)]
*  where in the middle of COVID and explain [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3813.9s)]
*  what we're trying to do. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3815.6600000000003s)]
*  And a lot of people were very upset. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3816.5s)]
*  I was like, guys, we're Republicans. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3818.9s)]
*  We don't believe in these laws [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3821.54s)]
*  that give you these protections [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3826.38s)]
*  that we think make you less good at your job [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3828.02s)]
*  of serving a particular president. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3830.6600000000003s)]
*  So it's just on its face outrageous. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3832.38s)]
*  Like everyone else in the country faces the vicissitudes [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3834.3s)]
*  of the job market. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3837.46s)]
*  I've been fired so many times with a lot of kids [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3838.3s)]
*  and I'm not whining, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3841.46s)]
*  but most people had moments like that. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3842.38s)]
*  We're like, oh wow, I'm out of money. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3844.9s)]
*  Why are the people that we pay with our tax dollars [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3846.5s)]
*  immune to the pressure that the rest of us feel? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3849.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like so crazy and outrageous. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3851.94s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you can't tell your boss [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3853.78s)]
*  what you think. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3855.5800000000004s)]
*  Like that's the most crazy thing in the world. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3856.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, why, like we what? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3858.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3860.98s)]
*  You know, I've worked for some pretty authoritarian people [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3861.82s)]
*  by the way over the years. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3864.78s)]
*  And the last people I worked for, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3866.1s)]
*  very nice to me I will say, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3868.02s)]
*  but like they have really strong views on a couple of topics [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3869.22s)]
*  and I like kept my views on those to myself at dinner. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3872.06s)]
*  They're my bosses. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3875.7s)]
*  I mean, I don't really understand like what, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3876.7799999999997s)]
*  how does an entirely separate set of rules apply [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3879.58s)]
*  to our employees, the public's employees, our housekeepers? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3883.98s)]
*  This is how I think of them. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3887.94s)]
*  They work for us. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3888.9s)]
*  And when your housekeeper works for you, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3890.14s)]
*  you get to fire, steals from you, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3891.7s)]
*  you get to fire her, correct? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3893.02s)]
*  And there's no other way to run any business, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3894.46s)]
*  any government. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3897.1000000000004s)]
*  But it's like on what grounds do they get to be treated [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3898.2200000000003s)]
*  better than every other category of employee in the world? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3903.0600000000004s)]
*  And they're also some of the suckiest employees [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3907.1400000000003s)]
*  as the son of a federal employee, I can tell you. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3909.2200000000003s)]
*  Some of them are great. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3911.7000000000003s)]
*  Most are not great, sub great, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3912.9s)]
*  which is why we have so many contractors [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3914.7000000000003s)]
*  running federal agencies, correct? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3916.42s)]
*  Totally. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3917.82s)]
*  And that's. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3918.6600000000003s)]
*  Like why is Deloitte at NSA? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3919.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3921.6600000000003s)]
*  Because most NSA employees like suck [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3922.5s)]
*  and they don't come in because of COVID. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3924.54s)]
*  They take three hour lunch breaks. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3925.74s)]
*  They're like not effective. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3926.94s)]
*  Am I telling the truth here? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3928.82s)]
*  You're telling the truth. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3929.98s)]
*  I know. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3930.98s)]
*  And that's why you've got to have a massive effort [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3931.82s)]
*  to dramatically reduce this [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3934.18s)]
*  so that the good ones rise to the top [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3935.7s)]
*  and everyone else is fine in other work. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3937.46s)]
*  Okay, sorry to get so wound up. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3941.7s)]
*  No, so, and then the last thing is dismantling [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3943.06s)]
*  all of the specific things like overclassification, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3948.7799999999997s)]
*  the FBI background checks, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3953.5s)]
*  all of the things that deny information [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3955.7799999999997s)]
*  to the political class that are the political appointees [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3958.2599999999998s)]
*  that prevent them from doing their job. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3962.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay, but this is where people start getting murdered [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3963.98s)]
*  or getting cancer or whatever they're doing [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3966.66s)]
*  to maintain control. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3969.74s)]
*  Because if you start threatening, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3970.56s)]
*  I think this is why they're terrified of Tulsi Gabbard, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3971.82s)]
*  you start threatening to expose things [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3974.5s)]
*  so that the public know what its government is doing. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3976.26s)]
*  You're going to be exposing crimes [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3978.2200000000003s)]
*  because they're committing crimes. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3979.46s)]
*  I know that for a fact. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3980.34s)]
*  I know that you know it too. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3981.5800000000004s)]
*  So that's like kind of a scary mission, is it not? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3983.9s)]
*  It is one that causes you to count the costs. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3987.42s)]
*  But the notion- [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3990.86s)]
*  You're so judicious. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3992.86s)]
*  I love it. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3994.26s)]
*  Tucker, the reality, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3995.6200000000003s)]
*  and I think this is I would encourage everyone [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3996.78s)]
*  to think this way. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3998.3s)]
*  There is no place in America [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=3999.7000000000003s)]
*  where you're going to be protected [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4001.5800000000004s)]
*  from the walls closing in on you and your family. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4002.82s)]
*  And the only extent to which that may not be true yet [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4005.9s)]
*  is which Kevin Bacon's degrees of separation, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4010.26s)]
*  you don't have someone that's immediately in proximity [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4014.34s)]
*  to the FBI raiding their house [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4016.86s)]
*  or being the victim of lawfare. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4020.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I know two people very, very closely [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4022.2200000000003s)]
*  who have been in jail. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4025.3s)]
*  I know- [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4027.02s)]
*  Oh, me too. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4027.86s)]
*  Four people that have multimillion dollar lawsuits. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4028.86s)]
*  And so they're coming. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4032.58s)]
*  And the only way to stop that from happening [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4034.06s)]
*  for people that are in this community [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4036.82s)]
*  trying to rebuild from a storm or run their coffee shop, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4039.58s)]
*  the only way to keep it from happening [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4043.2599999999998s)]
*  is for those of us in the political arena [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4044.82s)]
*  to stand tall and unabashedly [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4047.7799999999997s)]
*  and to lean forward no matter the costs. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4052.42s)]
*  And that's the moment that we live in. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4056.2599999999998s)]
*  And so it's not meant to be provocative. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4058.02s)]
*  It's just meant to know that if you are [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4059.82s)]
*  not loud and proud, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4064.62s)]
*  that's the wrong way to think about it. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4065.7s)]
*  But if it is aggressive and public and articulate [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4067.02s)]
*  in how you go about it, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4073.58s)]
*  it will make it so that more and more people [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4075.58s)]
*  can come along beside you [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4078.1s)]
*  and make it so that the president has enough people [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4080.2999999999997s)]
*  that are willing to take on the system. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4082.54s)]
*  And I believe that he has a growing number of people [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4084.2599999999998s)]
*  that are like that. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4087.14s)]
*  And it will make it very difficult for them [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4088.66s)]
*  to move against individual actors. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4090.7s)]
*  And the nice thing about being out of office [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4092.62s)]
*  is you get to read and kind of understand what happened [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4096.46s)]
*  and to have new perspective. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4103.26s)]
*  And I'm just blown away by the number of people [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4104.94s)]
*  that they went after individually, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4107.54s)]
*  like wounded individuals. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4109.9s)]
*  And we never heard about them. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4112.42s)]
*  I didn't hear about them until after the administration. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4113.54s)]
*  Adam Lovenger, Mark Moyer, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4116.14s)]
*  these are individuals that blew the whistle on corruption [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4119.34s)]
*  and their agencies conspired with their political appointees [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4123.3s)]
*  to make them go away. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4126.14s)]
*  And I don't think they'll be able to get away with that [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4129.14s)]
*  this time around. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4131.9s)]
*  And in some cases really hurt them. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4132.86s)]
*  They wasted three or four years, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4134.94s)]
*  they're dealing with stuff in their families, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4137.86s)]
*  life happens and you're dealing with the intel agencies, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4140.14s)]
*  multiple working behind the scenes together, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4144.06s)]
*  never giving you due process. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4147.62s)]
*  And I think that is, we know their playbook [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4149.94s)]
*  and we know not only what to look for, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4154.379999999999s)]
*  but how to be prepared to ensure that that cannot happen [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4158.259999999999s)]
*  again. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4163.7s)]
*  I've noticed and I don't think I'm imagining it [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4164.54s)]
*  that a huge percentage of people who criticize [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4166.0199999999995s)]
*  the intel agencies wind up with kiddie porn [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4169.139999999999s)]
*  on their computers. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4171.58s)]
*  One of the reasons I don't use a computer, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4172.98s)]
*  I don't think that's because disproportionately perverts. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4175.94s)]
*  You know, you would use a computer, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4179.22s)]
*  first of all, you can't respond to anything [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4180.820000000001s)]
*  without it being foiled, right? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4183.38s)]
*  And so we have to have a totally different view [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4185.06s)]
*  about going into government. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4189.02s)]
*  But the intel agencies are not allowed, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4190.740000000001s)]
*  well, most of them are not allowed [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4193.780000000001s)]
*  to operate domestically, period. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4195.02s)]
*  Well, they were never allowed, they do it, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4198.02s)]
*  but they're definitely not allowed to play [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4200.46s)]
*  in American politics to influence election outcomes [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4202.66s)]
*  and they're absolutely doing that. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4204.780000000001s)]
*  How do you stop that? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4205.700000000001s)]
*  Well, I think you need to have people that are there [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4207.9s)]
*  who are fearless and obviously Tulsi and RFK, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4210.78s)]
*  not intel, but there are certainly health aspects [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4213.74s)]
*  of national security, Matt being at DOJ. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4218.98s)]
*  Those are the types of people that you need [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4222.78s)]
*  to get under the hood and to push as much as you possible. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4224.66s)]
*  You've gotta shut their funding off until they can prove [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4228.74s)]
*  to your satisfaction that things are. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4232.339999999999s)]
*  And then- [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4234.78s)]
*  We're not even allowed to know what their funding is. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4235.62s)]
*  We don't know what the CIA's budget is. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4238.0599999999995s)]
*  Well- [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4240.58s)]
*  We don't even know like- [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4241.42s)]
*  When you're within government, you can know those answers [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4242.5s)]
*  and so those individuals can- [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4245.0599999999995s)]
*  You can know the size of the black budgets. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4246.74s)]
*  Correct. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4248.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4249.38s)]
*  So I have never been in government, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4250.22s)]
*  but I've certainly been around this a lot. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4252.74s)]
*  They're huge. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4254.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4255.74s)]
*  No, and- [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4256.58s)]
*  So why do we have black budgets? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4257.4s)]
*  It's a great question, Tucker. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4259.3s)]
*  I mean, there's just dramatically more transparency needed [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4260.66s)]
*  and I would say it's one of those areas [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4263.9s)]
*  where not unlike the overclassification, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4265.379999999999s)]
*  there are things we need to know a lot more about. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4270.94s)]
*  And I can't tell you, well, what's the optimal level [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4275.299999999999s)]
*  of transparency on that front? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4277.74s)]
*  But the extent to which you can't have as a citizen [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4280.96s)]
*  an understanding of what the size of your IC community is, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4285.299999999999s)]
*  that's kind of a problem. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4288.94s)]
*  I just think you're ensuring corruption. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4290.5s)]
*  And the size of these buildings, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4292.3s)]
*  like you go around and you realize, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4294.22s)]
*  oh wow, that alphabet has an enormous institutional presence [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4295.9800000000005s)]
*  that the country's never even heard about. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4302.02s)]
*  Has a real estate footprint [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4304.14s)]
*  that's beyond what you can imagine. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4305.46s)]
*  I lived as a child in with my brother [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4308.1s)]
*  in a house in Georgetown in high school [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4310.78s)]
*  that was owned by CIA. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4312.54s)]
*  So there's just a lot. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4314.860000000001s)]
*  You go out to Northern Virginia, Tyson's Corner, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4316.5s)]
*  take Chain Bridge from DC and Northern Virginia [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4319.900000000001s)]
*  and like how many of those office buildings [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4323.06s)]
*  are owned by the CIA or some other intel agency? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4323.900000000001s)]
*  Like a huge number. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4326.9400000000005s)]
*  And so why can't we know that? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4328.54s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4330.1s)]
*  We need to know a lot more. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4331.88s)]
*  And we need to demand that we know more. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4333.42s)]
*  Like how is Congress, and yeah, they can go into a skiff [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4336.02s)]
*  and they can be given a brief. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4339.780000000001s)]
*  Debates are supposed to happen on the House and Senate floor [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4342.42s)]
*  and you can't, you're providing no ability [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4345.3s)]
*  to be able to share with your voters and us as voters [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4348.92s)]
*  whether, did we ever vote for this? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4355.24s)]
*  Did we ever vote for this military industrial complex, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4358.04s)]
*  this intel community, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4361.16s)]
*  the extent to which it sprawled all over the country? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4362.84s)]
*  Like who got a say in that? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4365.28s)]
*  It doesn't seem like the intel. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4367.36s)]
*  I would say is rather undemocratic. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4369.2s)]
*  Well, the intel committees, the oversight committees [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4370.92s)]
*  in Congress whose job it is to oversee, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4374.64s)]
*  restrain, keep the intel agencies [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4377.4s)]
*  within constitutional bounds. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4379.96s)]
*  In my whole life in DC from 1985 until now, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4382.32s)]
*  I've never seen a single member of an intel committee [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4385.32s)]
*  who wasn't in the pocket of the intel agencies. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4387.44s)]
*  That's my perception. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4389.44s)]
*  Have you? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4390.719999999999s)]
*  I don't wanna, I will just say this. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4392.139999999999s)]
*  Devin Nunez was kind of a unique character [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4394.679999999999s)]
*  in his ability to provide leadership in that. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4400.2s)]
*  And they came after him with everything they got. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4404.08s)]
*  And he survived. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4407.88s)]
*  And I think he's a model, not unlike that. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4408.72s)]
*  When you say they, you mean the intel agencies. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4410.5599999999995s)]
*  The intel agencies. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4412.2s)]
*  The forces that are some out of government, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4413.28s)]
*  non-government organizations that progress [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4416.16s)]
*  and working with the intel agencies. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4418.44s)]
*  Running it through foreign countries. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4420.48s)]
*  I mean, it's never like some guy at Langley. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4422.0s)]
*  And so why don't we have more Devin Nunez? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4424.96s)]
*  That would be the question that I would ask [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4429.04s)]
*  is what fear factor is there that, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4430.32s)]
*  and I'm not making an accusation of anyone. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4434.84s)]
*  I'm just saying that with all Congress [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4437.28s)]
*  and with all non-government organizations, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4440.24s)]
*  even our organizations, there's this point [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4443.2s)]
*  where you're like, if I go after these individuals, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4445.0s)]
*  this issue set, or this area of corruption, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4449.28s)]
*  or this policy set, and I saw it right after Mar-a-Lago [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4453.04s)]
*  was raided and we came out really quickly and said, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4456.8s)]
*  the FBI should be radically reformed. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4459.6s)]
*  I think I thought it should be exploded [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4462.32s)]
*  into a thousand pieces, right? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4465.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4466.639999999999s)]
*  Why do we have such fear [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4468.92s)]
*  that that is such a provocative position? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4471.04s)]
*  Because you don't own the government. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4474.759999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4476.5599999999995s)]
*  And so that's what we've got to go after. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4477.4s)]
*  And I think it's a systemic issue [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4479.92s)]
*  that we've got to tackle with everything we've got. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4481.48s)]
*  I couldn't agree more and you don't have to respond, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4484.84s)]
*  but I would just say, if there are members of the [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4486.88s)]
*  Intel committees providing oversight of the Intel agencies, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4490.32s)]
*  they shouldn't be allowed to serve [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4494.28s)]
*  if they have spouses who work in the Intel community. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4495.28s)]
*  Sorry, that's such an obvious conflict [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4497.36s)]
*  that it's pretty ridiculous that that could exist, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4499.719999999999s)]
*  and yet it does. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4502.28s)]
*  So, tell us on a much happier note, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4504.4s)]
*  sorry for the dark digression, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4508.44s)]
*  what exactly are Elon and Vavate gonna do, do you think, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4511.0s)]
*  with this Doge enterprise? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4514.48s)]
*  Well, I think they're bringing an exhilarating rush [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4516.8s)]
*  to the system of creativity, outside the box thinking, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4519.400000000001s)]
*  comfortability with risk and leverage. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4527.2s)]
*  Both those guys are comfortable with risk. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4531.88s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4533.6s)]
*  And the reason I love it is, I mean, in some respects, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4534.4400000000005s)]
*  this does feel like an intractable problem [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4538.04s)]
*  that we're up against. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4540.12s)]
*  Yes, yes, exactly. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4540.96s)]
*  I don't think it is, but I think it feels that way. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4542.04s)]
*  And we're bringing people that [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4544.12s)]
*  are trying to get to Mars, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4546.16s)]
*  so I'm pretty sure they can handle [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4547.4s)]
*  the ability for us to balance our books [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4550.5599999999995s)]
*  and run a government that's much more efficient. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4553.12s)]
*  So I think that the things that I've heard them say [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4556.68s)]
*  are things like really going after, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4560.48s)]
*  from a deregulatory perspective, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4564.16s)]
*  all of the recent court cases that have said [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4565.92s)]
*  and chopped at the feet of this administrative state. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4570.0s)]
*  You don't have the ability to just come up [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4573.48s)]
*  with new major questions, rank agency, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4575.28s)]
*  rank and file agency. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4578.719999999999s)]
*  You've got to have actual specific language from Congress. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4580.12s)]
*  You don't have the ability to get the deference [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4584.36s)]
*  for every position that you've taken [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4586.5599999999995s)]
*  just because you're a federal agency. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4589.32s)]
*  These have been big ax cuts [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4591.24s)]
*  at the administrative branches. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4594.599999999999s)]
*  And so I think what they wanna do [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4597.88s)]
*  is to use those as the basis [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4600.36s)]
*  for a massive deregulatory agenda [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4602.32s)]
*  and game on. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4604.639999999999s)]
*  I also think they want to look for as much that you can do [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4606.719999999999s)]
*  to start cutting costs without Congress or with Congress, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4611.0s)]
*  but to be really aggressive in some of the areas [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4615.24s)]
*  that I've mentioned, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4617.639999999999s)]
*  and impoundment would be a huge part of that, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4618.48s)]
*  the ability to just not spend the money. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4620.719999999999s)]
*  And then of course, being as radical or aggressive [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4625.04s)]
*  as you can in eliminating and reducing employees, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4628.36s)]
*  full-time employees, individuals, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4634.879999999999s)]
*  and going after contracts that not make sense. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4637.16s)]
*  So I think that that's where they're headed, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4640.2s)]
*  and I think it'll be an enormous boon to the country. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4643.32s)]
*  Can you do it from, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4647.24s)]
*  so neither one of them is gonna become [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4648.28s)]
*  a federal employee himself. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4649.759999999999s)]
*  That's my understanding, correct? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4651.639999999999s)]
*  That's my understanding as well. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4652.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're not, I'll also say that. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4653.799999999999s)]
*  So how do you do that from outside? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4655.32s)]
*  Well, I think that they will be working [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4658.2s)]
*  with the agencies that do this. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4661.599999999999s)]
*  I think they'll be working with OMB, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4663.88s)]
*  whoever's in that role. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4665.4400000000005s)]
*  They'll be working with Treasury, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4666.4400000000005s)]
*  who's ever in that role, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4667.82s)]
*  and they will be rallying the theory of the case. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4669.72s)]
*  I mean, I think ultimately that's what's most needed, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4672.2s)]
*  Tucker, is a specific theory of the case [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4674.32s)]
*  about what can be done. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4677.54s)]
*  That's right. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4678.84s)]
*  And then you give it to the people, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4679.68s)]
*  and hopefully that's been a two-way conversation, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4681.96s)]
*  but you give it to the people that are [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4683.8s)]
*  on the president's executive team and his administration, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4686.64s)]
*  and they run with it, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4689.36s)]
*  and then you've got Doge out there [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4690.6s)]
*  providing a political support for what must be done. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4692.68s)]
*  Even just to publicize the ideas, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4695.52s)]
*  I mean, the US government at this point is like a, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4697.8s)]
*  it's like a bankruptcy or stage four cancers. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4700.160000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's like so overwhelmingly bad [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4702.400000000001s)]
*  that you don't see a way out of it. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4704.72s)]
*  At least that's how I feel when I assess it [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4706.88s)]
*  from the outside, like how would you even [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4708.360000000001s)]
*  fix something like that? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4709.72s)]
*  We haven't had any spending reductions [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4710.56s)]
*  in like 20 years, right? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4713.4400000000005s)]
*  But we're bankrupt, right? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4715.54s)]
*  But we're bankrupt, and there's just this notion [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4716.38s)]
*  that nothing can be done about it. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4718.84s)]
*  We still pass $100 billion Ukraine checks. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4720.240000000001s)]
*  Even if you thought it was a good idea, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4723.4800000000005s)]
*  like you can't afford it. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4724.52s)]
*  Like you never have the affordability conversation at all. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4725.8s)]
*  And it's totally true. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4729.400000000001s)]
*  Like literally no one ever talks about affordability [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4731.400000000001s)]
*  and what we can do. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4734.64s)]
*  And these foreign heads of state show up [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4735.4800000000005s)]
*  and like demand money from us, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4737.4800000000005s)]
*  and nobody ever says, you know, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4741.72s)]
*  I like your country, I don't, or whatever, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4743.280000000001s)]
*  I think you've got a good point, love to help you, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4745.0s)]
*  but we're just out of dough. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4746.64s)]
*  Like nobody even suggests that or dares think that. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4748.0s)]
*  Like what is that? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4751.84s)]
*  They just assume the gravy train's gonna keep on going. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4752.92s)]
*  I've dealt with the most within the military, right? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4755.28s)]
*  But like- [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4757.54s)]
*  What's that like? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4758.56s)]
*  Well, they- [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4760.28s)]
*  Well, you've got some road miles on you. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4763.2s)]
*  You've done some stuff. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4764.8s)]
*  Well, you know, I wanna understand these things. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4766.52s)]
*  I wanna understand these systems and these institutions, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4769.04s)]
*  why people say that what they do. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4771.12s)]
*  And there's just, there's no understanding what's, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4773.78s)]
*  so there's like a, no fiscal conscience at all [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4778.78s)]
*  with regard to the individuals. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4781.98s)]
*  It's like, nope, we've gotta perform a particular function [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4783.34s)]
*  in the world. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4786.62s)]
*  I read that somewhere in my educational system. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4787.46s)]
*  I now believe it. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4789.86s)]
*  Doesn't matter whether that was never voted on. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4791.099999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter if that's kind of anathema [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4793.099999999999s)]
*  to where our founding fathers would have envisioned. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4794.9s)]
*  And so we are going to maintain our presence [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4797.179999999999s)]
*  everywhere in the country. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4799.7s)]
*  I, the military, get to define my requirements [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4801.259999999999s)]
*  about what's necessary to win that military objective. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4805.52s)]
*  You civilian don't get to ever question my requirements. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4809.38s)]
*  Those requirements now automatically cost X amount of money. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4812.88s)]
*  And we wonder why we can't ever have any cuts to defense. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4817.080000000001s)]
*  And we wonder why then defense spending becomes [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4821.120000000001s)]
*  the Praetorian Guard for the non-defense spending. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4824.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4826.84s)]
*  Okay. I know what you're talking about, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4827.68s)]
*  but will you flesh it out a little bit? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4829.4400000000005s)]
*  Cause I think you've hit on one of the keys. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4830.72s)]
*  So for what we have been unwilling to cut [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4832.24s)]
*  any non-defense spending, the bureaucracy, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4837.84s)]
*  which is the quote discretionary spending, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4840.04s)]
*  members have a vote on it every single year. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4842.84s)]
*  They don't have a vote on entitlements. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4846.3s)]
*  They, those are on autopilot. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4848.28s)]
*  They have a vote on the bureaucracy. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4850.08s)]
*  So everything they hate about government, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4851.66s)]
*  their members are voting on. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4853.2s)]
*  We haven't been able to have cuts to non-defense, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4855.0s)]
*  not because Republicans are unwilling, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4858.5199999999995s)]
*  although many of them are unwilling as well, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4860.5s)]
*  but because there has been a view that those two things [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4863.34s)]
*  have to be constantly considered together. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4866.82s)]
*  And the Democrats insist and Republican hawks insist [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4869.5s)]
*  that defense has to be growing at X percent [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4874.86s)]
*  to deal with the threats in the world. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4878.38s)]
*  And that requires you to then bring additional [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4880.56s)]
*  non-defense spending to be able to be [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4884.78s)]
*  for that political coalition. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4887.22s)]
*  And ultimately, if you get your average Republican member, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4889.3s)]
*  they ultimately care a lot more about the defense stuff [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4894.1s)]
*  than they do about the bureaucracy. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4897.06s)]
*  Can you say that again? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4899.14s)]
*  Ultimately, you have your average Republican member [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4900.78s)]
*  cares more about the military industrial complex [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4903.22s)]
*  than they do about the woke and weaponized bureaucracy [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4905.24s)]
*  that is oppressing. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4907.62s)]
*  They care more about flexing their power abroad [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4908.860000000001s)]
*  than about fixing their own country. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4911.9800000000005s)]
*  I think that's, I know that's true because I know, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4913.9400000000005s)]
*  I know them, they have zero interest in anything [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4916.94s)]
*  that's happened, not zero, but they have very limited interest [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4919.54s)]
*  in what's happening in the United States [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4922.74s)]
*  and the 100,000 people dying of drug odies every year. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4924.58s)]
*  That's bad, yeah, it's so bad, ooh, my heart bleeds. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4927.179999999999s)]
*  The invasion of more than 10 million foreigners [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4929.46s)]
*  into our country without permission, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4932.719999999999s)]
*  no, that's so bad, yeah, yeah, gotta seal the border. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4934.54s)]
*  But what they really care about is toppling some government [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4936.82s)]
*  they don't like or moving missiles to this military base [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4941.379999999999s)]
*  or whatever, and why is that? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4945.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, I think it goes to the unhealthiness [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4947.62s)]
*  of the Republican coalition for like 50 years, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4949.259999999999s)]
*  but particularly since 1989. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4952.38s)]
*  Tell me what that means. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4955.34s)]
*  So your kind of National Review Coalition, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4957.3s)]
*  your fusionist Republican coalition was anti-communist, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4961.86s)]
*  it was social conservatives, traditional conservatives, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4966.66s)]
*  and it was kind of fiscal libertarians, right? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4969.66s)]
*  That was your coalition. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4972.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4974.0599999999995s)]
*  And it worked until, at a certain level, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4974.9s)]
*  when we had the Soviet Union. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4978.099999999999s)]
*  But when we don't have the Soviet Union, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4980.139999999999s)]
*  it kind of takes on a life of its own, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4983.0599999999995s)]
*  and now you have to keep us everywhere in the world [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4986.82s)]
*  to be able to justify all of the institutional buildup [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4989.66s)]
*  and the complex that has been built up, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4993.16s)]
*  all of these defense industrial companies [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4995.98s)]
*  and things like that. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=4999.86s)]
*  And Pappy Keehan actually talks about this in his book [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5001.0599999999995s)]
*  where he says, look, this was a specific strategy [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5004.08s)]
*  hatched out of the Department of Defense [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5007.0s)]
*  by some of the neocons at the time [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5009.96s)]
*  to be able to continue to justify the largest, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5012.48s)]
*  from a defense standpoint, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5016.5199999999995s)]
*  that we continue to be tied down to. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5017.76s)]
*  That, I also think, is, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5021.48s)]
*  so that's a big part of, I think, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5024.68s)]
*  why your average Republican that grows up thinking like, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5026.12s)]
*  okay, I'm gonna be pro-defense, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5029.8s)]
*  I'm gonna be free market economics, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5032.08s)]
*  and I'm gonna be a social conservative, at best, right? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5035.4s)]
*  That's what you grow up to be. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5037.96s)]
*  100%. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5040.6s)]
*  And you don't actually then think through, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5041.44s)]
*  okay, what does that mean? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5042.92s)]
*  Does that mean I have to then be for every war [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5044.44s)]
*  that's been hatched? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5047.04s)]
*  Does that, do I not to be for making a defense [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5047.86s)]
*  that we can actually afford? [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5054.32s)]
*  Does that mean that, I think that, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5055.98s)]
*  from an economic standpoint, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5057.68s)]
*  that we're not actually citizens before we're consumers? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5059.04s)]
*  There's just a lot of unhealth in all of those. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5062.32s)]
*  Yes, and it's not a natural coalition. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5064.32s)]
*  Famously, you see this in the Democratic Party, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5066.88s)]
*  where you've got Hispanic immigrants [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5069.32s)]
*  alongside transgender activists, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5072.56s)]
*  and they clearly have nothing in common. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5075.32s)]
*  Everyone says that, but fewer say the obvious, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5077.36s)]
*  on the Republican side, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5080.96s)]
*  which is that social conservatives [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5081.8s)]
*  aren't natural pro-war people, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5084.28s)]
*  and most of them are Christians, for one thing, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5086.68s)]
*  so why would they be in favor of killing innocents? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5088.16s)]
*  They're not, actually. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5091.12s)]
*  They're believers in a religion [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5092.72s)]
*  that specifically prohibits that, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5093.96s)]
*  specifically and repeatedly. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5096.72s)]
*  So I don't know how they've hung together for so long. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5099.099999999999s)]
*  I'm going to, obvious about my position on this, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5102.24s)]
*  I find them repugnant, murderous, so that's my view, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5104.7s)]
*  but I don't think I'm alone in that. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5109.16s)]
*  Why are Christian conservatives naturally defense hawks? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5110.5599999999995s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5113.4s)]
*  Not just defense hawks, war hawks. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5114.24s)]
*  What happened in that? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5116.5199999999995s)]
*  How do Christian conservatives wind up, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5117.96s)]
*  and I don't want to get too controversial [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5119.8s)]
*  because I don't want to hurt you, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5121.12s)]
*  but because I want you to get this job, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5121.96s)]
*  but yeah, I'll just stop there. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5123.64s)]
*  Yes, I agree, without being too specific about it, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5125.84s)]
*  but there are all kinds of acts of violence [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5127.360000000001s)]
*  against Christians around the world. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5130.4400000000005s)]
*  In fact, it's almost always against Christians, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5133.84s)]
*  I have noticed, that Christian leaders, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5135.46s)]
*  including the Speaker of the House, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5138.12s)]
*  like defend on Christian grounds, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5140.84s)]
*  and I just don't think, obviously I find that evil, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5142.84s)]
*  but even if I was in favor of it, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5146.2s)]
*  I would recognize that's not something [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5148.320000000001s)]
*  that can last for long, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5149.160000000001s)]
*  because it doesn't make any sense, right? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5150.0s)]
*  Well, I do believe this is why [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5151.84s)]
*  we need to be less doctrinaire on the right, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5153.320000000001s)]
*  and to actually think. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5157.68s)]
*  Read those books you were mentioning earlier? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5160.080000000001s)]
*  Read, and to be thinking through it, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5162.88s)]
*  ask the questions, and trying to learn more, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5164.6s)]
*  and realize a history book may have been written at a time [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5166.8s)]
*  with a particular political benefit and meaning to it, [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5170.0s)]
*  and so maybe we don't take everything, you know? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5175.4s)]
*  I don't know, maybe some skills we learned in school, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5178.28s)]
*  and just common sense, intuition, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5181.48s)]
*  this is something that I think is something seems off, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5184.84s)]
*  it's off. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5189.68s)]
*  And we- [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5191.2s)]
*  That's a God-given skill that we have, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5192.2s)]
*  we were born with it, I think it was given by God, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5194.08s)]
*  but even if you don't believe in God, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5196.0s)]
*  we were born with it, and we don't use it. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5197.4s)]
*  And you see it in some of the attacks on RFK, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5199.2s)]
*  they say, well, this hasn't been proven, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5201.68s)]
*  there are gaps in our understanding, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5203.96s)]
*  our scientific understanding. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5205.52s)]
*  That's like their bureaucratic way of saying, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5207.28s)]
*  yeah, your intuition's right, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5210.4400000000005s)]
*  we just haven't proved it to be able to- [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5212.0s)]
*  Well, they train you not to use your intuition. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5213.68s)]
*  It's like, wait a second, I remember being in high school, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5215.56s)]
*  reading an abnormal psychology textbook [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5218.56s)]
*  that I bought at the school bookstore, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5220.92s)]
*  that had an entry on autism that was like two paragraphs long, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5222.96s)]
*  as this esoteric disorder whose origins we're uncertain of, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5227.400000000001s)]
*  whose parameters were unclear, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5231.16s)]
*  and I remember thinking, wow, that sounds awful. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5233.04s)]
*  And 35 years later, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5235.52s)]
*  it's like a central feature of life in America, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5237.84s)]
*  like what the hell, and you're trained, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5240.320000000001s)]
*  and by the way, I don't know what has caused [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5243.0s)]
*  a massive spike in autism, but there has been one. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5244.88s)]
*  And so it takes a lot of training [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5248.04s)]
*  to get people to ignore that. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5249.4800000000005s)]
*  And I do think the training is all designed [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5251.4400000000005s)]
*  to get you to ignore what is obvious. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5253.04s)]
*  I think it is, I think that the systems do it, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5255.400000000001s)]
*  people get into these, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5258.56s)]
*  and that's where they kind of get to the paradigm level. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5259.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm not gonna do anything that would hurt national security. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5261.64s)]
*  I came to DC, I'm not gonna do anything [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5265.08s)]
*  that would hurt national security. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5267.04s)]
*  I think that's how we lose people [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5268.320000000001s)]
*  when they go into the skiffs, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5269.400000000001s)]
*  just to go back to our earlier conversation. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5270.8s)]
*  And you've gotta have courage to say, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5273.320000000001s)]
*  look, what happens if your time in office, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5275.280000000001s)]
*  you missed a big issue? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5279.08s)]
*  Like, MAHA is a new issue to me, I admit it. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5281.240000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to read, I'm trying to read the means book, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5284.320000000001s)]
*  I've listened to your podcast, it's a new issue. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5286.68s)]
*  But like, if I didn't get my head wrapped around it, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5290.44s)]
*  future generations would have to indict me [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5293.48s)]
*  for me being irresponsible [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5295.36s)]
*  on an existential issue facing our country. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5297.48s)]
*  So I don't think most people think like that. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5299.799999999999s)]
*  But in general, I think our Republican coalition [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5302.5599999999995s)]
*  is unhealthy and has been for a long time [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5305.759999999999s)]
*  because we have, and if we are, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5309.04s)]
*  the country will be too secular, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5311.12s)]
*  too imperialistic and global and too economic. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5315.2s)]
*  And I come out of the free market economist lane, right? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5318.24s)]
*  That's where I got my start. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5321.0s)]
*  But we're not consumers. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5322.8s)]
*  Like, the notion that the end of all economic good [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5324.96s)]
*  is consumption and so consumers get the veto on everything, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5327.5199999999995s)]
*  it's not actually what a citizen [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5330.84s)]
*  and a country and a nation are. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5333.2s)]
*  And so in each of those- [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5334.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm sorry, I feel like you're saying [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5336.4s)]
*  something really important [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5337.84s)]
*  and I just wanna make sure that it's fully explained. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5338.679999999999s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5341.16s)]
*  Too economic. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5342.599999999999s)]
*  Too economic, so- [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5343.76s)]
*  So you're not a socialist, I know you're not. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5344.84s)]
*  No, I'm a free market conservative, right? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5346.12s)]
*  But I don't believe that just because [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5349.04s)]
*  Facebook is a corporation, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5353.72s)]
*  that means that they get to not have to answer questions [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5356.24s)]
*  about how big they are, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5359.36s)]
*  what the impact is on our country. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5361.0s)]
*  Whether they're wrecking my kids' brains. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5363.44s)]
*  Amazon giving me same day service on a book [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5365.28s)]
*  or a product is awesome, I love it. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5369.4s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that everything that Amazon does [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5372.88s)]
*  is something that we shouldn't be thinking through [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5376.56s)]
*  and that our normal disposition of free market economics [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5379.88s)]

*  once they get too big. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5390.88s)]
*  What does seem like there, as you said a second ago, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5392.120000000001s)]
*  we need to be less doctrinaire. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5395.64s)]
*  And I, as someone who grew up around, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5398.4400000000005s)]
*  as a conservative, around conservatives, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5400.68s)]
*  there were these pillars, you know? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5402.240000000001s)]
*  Caucasian defense, free market, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5403.5199999999995s)]
*  and to a much lesser extent, socially conservative, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5407.839999999999s)]
*  which no one in DC actually took seriously at all. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5410.04s)]
*  And they had total contempt for people like you. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5412.5599999999995s)]
*  I assume you didn't grow up in DC. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5414.799999999999s)]
*  I did not. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5416.28s)]
*  Thankfully, the son of an electrician and a school teacher. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5417.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so this is exactly the kind of person [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5420.879999999999s)]
*  everyone in DC despised. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5422.679999999999s)]
*  Like some Christian electrician, please shut up. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5425.04s)]
*  That was their view, sorry, I'm sure you know that. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5427.36s)]
*  But it's a fact I was there. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5429.12s)]
*  But on the free market stuff, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5430.719999999999s)]
*  if you asked any questions at all, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5432.2s)]
*  it was like, shut up socialist. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5434.08s)]
*  And you don't wanna be a socialist [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5436.04s)]
*  because that hasn't worked and it was embarrassing. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5437.84s)]
*  But they kind of maintained control of people [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5440.36s)]
*  on behalf of some of the worst interests in the world [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5443.56s)]
*  by invoking that. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5446.5199999999995s)]
*  That's slur, you're a socialist. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5448.96s)]
*  Oh, you're a socialist. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5449.96s)]
*  Did you know what I'm talking about? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5451.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they do in the foreign policy. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5452.12s)]
*  That's a, you're a useful idiot for Russia or, you know. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5454.48s)]
*  Wait, they call you a useful idiot for Russia? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5457.56s)]
*  Well, they're saying that about Tulsi. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5459.4s)]
*  They say that about Tulsi, right? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5461.04s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5462.6s)]
*  And so I've lived that, yes. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5463.44s)]
*  You've seen that? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5464.64s)]
*  Yeah, I have, yeah. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5465.48s)]
*  In every one of these things, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5466.32s)]
*  when they don't wanna have the conversation, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5467.4s)]
*  they shut it down with a slur. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5469.36s)]
*  Of course. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5470.64s)]
*  And that's... [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5471.48s)]
*  But on the economic questions, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5472.36s)]
*  I think I've been almost hesitant [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5473.8s)]
*  to draw obvious conclusions [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5476.52s)]
*  because I don't believe in government controlling [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5478.76s)]
*  the economy to a greater extent than it does. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5481.44s)]
*  I just could not go to it and it just, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5484.32s)]
*  it abets corruption, so I'm against that. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5486.24s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that we have to be in favor of usury, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5487.96s)]
*  right? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5493.0s)]
*  Why is it good to charge 20% interest on a credit card? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5493.84s)]
*  Do I have to nod along with that [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5497.88s)]
*  just because I'm a conservative? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5499.16s)]
*  And that's where, if the coalition was working, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5500.84s)]
*  you'd have a lot more interesting conversations. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5502.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5504.64s)]
*  You'd have your Christian conservatives [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5505.4800000000005s)]
*  being upset with that, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5507.04s)]
*  having debates with the free market coalition to say, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5508.32s)]
*  where's a place that we can land [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5512.0s)]
*  in ways that previously the conversation wasn't, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5515.320000000001s)]
*  because in this to say, okay, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5518.88s)]
*  that's something that would come out of the mouths [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5520.200000000001s)]
*  of our adversaries. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5521.68s)]
*  And we need more of that, I think. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5525.92s)]
*  And you're gonna see it in trade, right? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5527.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5529.68s)]
*  Trades that the one big domino that president, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5530.52s)]
*  I think finally has now toppled with his election, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5533.240000000001s)]
*  but there will be a sizable number of Republicans [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5536.8s)]
*  that are very grudgingly going along, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5539.68s)]
*  or opposed to what he wants to do [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5541.92s)]
*  with what I think is a no brainer policy [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5544.32s)]
*  with regard to universal tariffs [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5546.52s)]
*  and higher tariffs for China. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5549.4800000000005s)]
*  And I want the money to be able to balance the books, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5551.08s)]
*  but I also want this country [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5553.16s)]
*  to be a manufacturing producing hub. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5555.2s)]
*  And what I found Tucker is that even I can win arguments [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5558.16s)]
*  with those who are free traders [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5561.84s)]
*  because they themselves have seeded [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5567.64s)]
*  the ground of independence. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5570.48s)]
*  If you're comfortable with other countries [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5574.12s)]
*  making your stuff, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5576.0s)]
*  that may or may not be important [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5577.919999999999s)]
*  from a national security standpoint, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5579.5599999999995s)]
*  or just period, because we won't wanna have to wait [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5580.799999999999s)]
*  for six months to have a refrigerator. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5582.919999999999s)]
*  If you want independence, you gotta make it here. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5586.639999999999s)]
*  If you don't want to have to rely on China [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5589.44s)]
*  and have Xi shut down his whole economy [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5591.599999999999s)]
*  because he's dealing with the COVID, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5594.799999999999s)]
*  then the answer is independence. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5597.2s)]
*  And how do you get to making things more here? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5599.68s)]
*  And I also zoom out from a standpoint of like- [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5601.76s)]
*  If my parents are paying my rent, I'm still a child. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5603.76s)]
*  It doesn't matter how old I am. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5605.84s)]
*  Right? That's right. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5607.04s)]
*  And there is a balance in every community [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5607.88s)]
*  where not all gonna be carpenters, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5610.0s)]
*  or plumbers, or electricians, right? [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5611.64s)]
*  Like you're not gonna be independent [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5613.320000000001s)]
*  as a person or a community across the board. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5615.360000000001s)]
*  But you would kind of hate it [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5618.8s)]
*  if we didn't have any carpenters in your community, right? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5620.12s)]
*  You'd hate it if you didn't have any plumbers [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5622.84s)]
*  in your community. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5624.72s)]
*  And we've gotten to the point as a country [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5626.280000000001s)]
*  where we don't make this stuff anymore. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5628.44s)]
*  And that's a real problem. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5631.44s)]
*  And I think it's just kind of an intuition way [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5633.04s)]
*  of getting at something that has been suppressed [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5635.679999999999s)]
*  for decades. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5639.839999999999s)]
*  What has been suppressed, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5640.679999999999s)]
*  and there are specific institutions [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5641.879999999999s)]
*  that have made it their mission to suppress it. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5643.5199999999995s)]
*  One is the Wall Street Journal, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5645.36s)]
*  the other is the American Enterprise Institute, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5646.44s)]
*  which for my whole life, 55 years, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5649.24s)]
*  have been sort of leading standards [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5651.5199999999995s)]
*  in the right-wing firmament. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5654.28s)]
*  AEI, Wall Street Journal, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5657.16s)]
*  like people really care on the right what they have to say. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5659.48s)]
*  And I can't wait for both of them to collapse. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5661.92s)]
*  I will celebrate, I really will celebrate [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5663.72s)]
*  when they go under, and I mean that. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5667.0s)]
*  But like why haven't people who wanna put the country first, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5669.04s)]
*  its actual interests first, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5673.28s)]
*  built their own institutions [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5674.48s)]
*  to rival the Wall Street Journal and AEI? [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5675.599999999999s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5677.88s)]
*  This has been my life's work for the last four years, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5678.76s)]
*  and hopefully over the next 50, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5681.84s)]
*  if I live that long. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5685.52s)]
*  50, how old are you Ross? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5686.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, you're big in the maha thing now, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5688.280000000001s)]
*  so maybe it's possible. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5690.84s)]
*  That's right, you know, get that 50 on. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5691.68s)]
*  Look, I think this is what is needed as new institutions. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5694.68s)]
*  That's why we created the Center for Renewing America, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5698.4400000000005s)]
*  because we wanted to make sure there was a home [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5700.4800000000005s)]
*  to give elites, both in DC and in the grassroots, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5703.320000000001s)]
*  this is actually how you do what's necessary to be done. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5708.88s)]
*  So like if President Trump gives a speech [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5711.76s)]
*  in the first term or you from your show [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5714.04s)]
*  or articulating something that must be done, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5716.28s)]
*  we felt there needed to be an institution [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5718.96s)]
*  to actually take that and turn it into the regulations, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5721.12s)]
*  translating into actually public policy. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5727.32s)]
*  And that has to be new. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5730.0s)]
*  Some exceptions exist. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5732.28s)]
*  I mean, Kevin is doing a great job at Heritage, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5733.6s)]
*  but that's the exception rather than the rule. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5736.12s)]
*  My view is that you've gotta create new institutions [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5737.76s)]
*  that are scrappy, are hungry. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5741.32s)]
*  It doesn't take them two weeks to write a paper. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5745.44s)]
*  It takes them one day to write a paper. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5747.44s)]
*  You get it out there. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5749.2s)]
*  And if that paper's not read, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5750.2s)]
*  you go and you like get it in front of people [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5751.759999999999s)]
*  so that they understand it. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5753.9s)]
*  And then when they have read it and you figure, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5755.28s)]
*  why haven't you acted on it? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5757.2s)]
*  What's, you know, like you have to work it hard. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5758.44s)]
*  And that's gonna come from not sitting around a board table [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5762.32s)]
*  at a prestigious organization. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5765.12s)]
*  That's gonna come from people who are hard and battle tested [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5766.5599999999995s)]
*  and really awesome in their mind [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5771.04s)]
*  as to what they think and what they know. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5773.12s)]
*  I mean, since we've moved toward an economy [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5775.9s)]
*  where like you can't really do anything [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5777.9s)]
*  without a billionaire on your side, I've noticed. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5779.24s)]
*  Luckily, you know, good people now have Elon Musk. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5781.96s)]
*  He's our billionaire, which is great. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5785.08s)]
*  But big picture, it's super bad [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5787.44s)]
*  to need a billionaire to do anything meaningful. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5790.56s)]
*  And you wonder, are Republican donors coming around [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5793.28s)]
*  to the idea that, you know, America needs to be saved [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5797.92s)]
*  and that what we've been doing isn't working? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5802.02s)]
*  Do you think they see this? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5803.9400000000005s)]
*  Look, there's a lot of awesome conservative donors. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5805.34s)]
*  There are? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5807.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You would know. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5808.740000000001s)]
*  And many of them are coming to our banner over time. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5809.580000000001s)]
*  I think the issue is, you know, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5813.8s)]
*  do they know about your organization, the impact? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5815.620000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of grift on the, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5817.9800000000005s)]
*  and that's the problem is like, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5819.9400000000005s)]
*  you've got to kind of show yourself. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5821.02s)]
*  There's so much grift. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5822.660000000001s)]
*  Right? It's unbelievable. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5823.740000000001s)]
*  You kind of have to acknowledge, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5825.4400000000005s)]
*  yeah, there's a lot of grift out here, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5826.860000000001s)]
*  but at the same time, do everything you can [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5827.9400000000005s)]
*  to just get up in the morning and do your job [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5829.82s)]
*  and do it effectively. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5831.54s)]
*  And then people come. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5832.38s)]
*  Where I feel like the issue is, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5833.54s)]
*  is that with everyone, you're educating them [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5835.099999999999s)]
*  on the same journey that I think you have. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5838.219999999999s)]
*  I think you've talked about it, and I know I have, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5840.099999999999s)]
*  of this trying to, like, [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5842.38s)]
*  what has been off about conservatism for a while [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5845.219999999999s)]
*  and been, I think, the reason why we have lost [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5848.58s)]
*  and been on the edge of tyranny. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5851.12s)]
*  And sometimes there are folks [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5852.98s)]
*  that still have viewpoints on that. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5856.0199999999995s)]
*  Like when we took Ukraine, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5857.5s)]
*  we were the first organization out [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5858.62s)]
*  to oppose Ukraine funding. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5860.0199999999995s)]
*  That was risky, right? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5862.32s)]
*  Because Putin had just invaded and gone over them. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5863.66s)]
*  We didn't want that, but we knew where this was headed, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5867.46s)]
*  and that was a long time for us to educate all states. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5870.82s)]
*  Can I just ask now, I'm being like mean and bitter, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5874.18s)]
*  but why would anybody who thought that was a good idea [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5877.18s)]
*  have power ever again? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5881.0s)]
*  Like, shouldn't that be a litmus test? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5882.82s)]
*  I do believe that Ukraine should be a litmus test [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5884.58s)]
*  for the national security team, for sure. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5887.42s)]
*  Well, it hasn't been, unfortunately. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5889.34s)]
*  Well, it's certainly in terms of getting a read [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5890.9800000000005s)]
*  on where someone is, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5894.46s)]
*  and then you can have whatever conversations [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5895.5s)]
*  you want to have with them. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5897.22s)]
*  That was obvious to me. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5898.86s)]
*  I'm just a stupid cable news host, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5899.9s)]
*  not a national security expert, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5902.38s)]
*  but I've been around it a lot. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5904.68s)]
*  I'm just trying to apply common sense. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5905.82s)]
*  Like, that was so obvious in February of 2022. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5907.18s)]
*  This was gonna hurt the United States in very serious ways, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5910.88s)]
*  and it has. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5913.82s)]
*  And it has. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5914.66s)]
*  So over time, that coalition, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5916.0s)]
*  that conversation we're having about what does conservatism [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5918.48s)]
*  need to be to save the country? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5922.799999999999s)]
*  Not protecting your little niche within that, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5924.919999999999s)]
*  but to save the country. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5927.639999999999s)]
*  You were given resources to do nothing else [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5929.24s)]
*  but to save the country, [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5932.32s)]
*  and that's what your donors are giving. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5933.799999999999s)]
*  That conversation and the ideas is why, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5936.4s)]
*  when you come to one of our events with our donors, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5938.24s)]
*  I hand out books. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5941.4s)]
*  Like, I don't want you to just necessarily [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5942.64s)]
*  read our policy paper. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5945.04s)]
*  I'm sure you're gonna do that anyways. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5946.68s)]
*  I want you reading Whitaker Chambers. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5948.200000000001s)]
*  I want you reading Rusty Reno, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5949.96s)]
*  Return of the Strong Gods, right? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5953.360000000001s)]
*  I want you reading this stuff. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5954.660000000001s)]
*  We're giving out Pat Buchanan books. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5956.76s)]
*  Like, I want the whole conservative movement [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5958.240000000001s)]
*  to be going deep in these books [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5961.02s)]
*  so that you're both enlightened, encouraged, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5962.88s)]
*  and you come out of fighting force, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5966.240000000001s)]
*  whether you are the practitioner here in DC, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5967.6s)]
*  the funder on the outside, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5971.02s)]
*  and that's a long-term project, honestly, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5973.14s)]
*  but I think it's one that's absolutely vital. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5977.860000000001s)]
*  Last question. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5980.22s)]
*  In retrospect, one of the things I'm most guilty about [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5981.46s)]
*  was being used by, well, Bill Kristol in particular, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5984.26s)]
*  but just as a young man, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5987.46s)]
*  I was used by the forces that control Washington [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5989.06s)]
*  to attack both Ross Perot and especially Pat Buchanan. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5992.1s)]
*  You know, whatever, they're human beings. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5997.1s)]
*  They have flaws, obviously, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=5998.5s)]
*  but big picture, they were kind of right [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6000.14s)]
*  about a lot of stuff, correct? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6002.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they were absolutely right. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6003.9400000000005s)]
*  They were, they were. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6005.14s)]
*  Yeah, and this has been an undercurrent [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6006.18s)]
*  that has been popped up at times, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6009.18s)]
*  but is largely suppressed by the Republican establishment [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6010.900000000001s)]
*  and their intellectual Praetorian Guard, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6014.76s)]
*  National Review and others, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6017.18s)]
*  and Pat Buchanan was a major opportunity [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6018.900000000001s)]
*  for it to punch through, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6023.38s)]
*  and then Donald Trump really punched through, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6024.38s)]
*  and now it's ascendant, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6026.42s)]
*  and it's about us going back and trying to think through, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6028.14s)]
*  like, what are some of these viewpoints mean? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6030.8s)]
*  Like, where were they right? [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6035.62s)]
*  Were wrong? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6036.46s)]
*  What does it look like in health? [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6037.58s)]
*  What does it look like with AI? [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6039.04s)]
*  What does it look like in all of these different areas? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6041.02s)]
*  But I think it's primarily remembering [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6043.740000000001s)]
*  that we're individuals with souls. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6046.14s)]
*  We're a nation. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6049.9400000000005s)]
*  We're not just an economy. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6050.9400000000005s)]
*  These are the kinds of kind of first building blocks [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6053.0s)]
*  that if you get in place, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6055.700000000001s)]
*  then you can have a much more coherent, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6056.74s)]
*  convincing and satisfying public policy life. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6059.0599999999995s)]
*  But ultimately, I think it's like Whitaker Chambers [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6062.26s)]
*  married to Pat Buchanan, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6064.9s)]
*  married to someone like a Donald Trump. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6066.179999999999s)]
*  I think that movement over time is something [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6069.46s)]
*  that trying to find how to give it flourish in life [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6073.46s)]
*  and institutions and will ultimately be successful [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6077.82s)]
*  in saving the country. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6081.78s)]
*  Man, if you wind up at this administration, [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6082.78s)]
*  I will sleep better, I mean that. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6084.5s)]
*  So thank you, Russ, I appreciate it. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6086.18s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Tucker. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6087.42s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6088.66s)]
*  I know. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6096.780000000001s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6097.62s)]
*  with everything at stake, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6100.200000000001s)]
*  Google would be putting its thumb on the scale [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6101.46s)]
*  and preventing you from hearing anything [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6104.18s)]
*  that the people in charge don't want you to hear. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6107.38s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6109.06s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6110.62s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6111.46s)]
*  but that's a waste of time. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6113.22s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6114.46s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6116.46s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that's true. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6117.54s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6121.54s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6123.58s)]
*  is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6125.599999999999s)]
*  Subscribe and you'll have a much higher chance [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6127.5599999999995s)]
*  of hearing what we say and we hope you will. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI&t=6131.46s)]
