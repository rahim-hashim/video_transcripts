# Steve Robinson Exposes the Chinese Mafia’s Drug Empire Flooding the US & Politicians Covering It Up
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc)
*  We recently had a remarkable conversation with a man called Steve Robinson, one of the last [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=0.0s)]
*  independent journalists in the state of Maine, and he told us a story that stunned us. It's about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  the Chinese takeover, the takeover by Chinese drug cartels of the largest state in the Northeast. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=11.36s)]
*  It's a story about what happens when immigration laws are ignored, when state and local governments [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  fail to do their duty. We have a documentary out about this right now. It's on TCN. The documentary [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=23.52s)]
*  is called High Crimes, the Chinese Mafia's Takeover of Rural America. It's shocking. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=28.96s)]
*  Watch it now. It's available only at Tucker Carlson.com. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=35.92s)]
*  Thank you for doing this. You're the best journalist in Maine. You're one of about six [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=59.6s)]
*  journalists in Maine. But if it weren't for you, I don't think anybody would have any idea what was [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=66.4s)]
*  happening in the state of Maine. So let's go to the story that has kind of defined your coverage [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=73.6s)]
*  over the last couple of years, and that is the, I don't think it's too strong to say, the takeover [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=79.28s)]
*  of rural Maine by Chinese drug cartels. I'll stand back and let you describe the scale of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=84.32s)]
*  this and what it is. Well, I mean, it's shocking. I would say there's probably 300 to 400 properties [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  throughout the state of Maine that are under the control of what the Department of Homeland Security [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=98.08s)]
*  under President Biden called Asian transnational criminal organizations. Chinese mafia, I think, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=102.88s)]
*  is a better term and an easier way to understand it. This first came to light in the end of 2023 [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=110.24s)]
*  when a reporter from the Daily Caller News Foundation, Jenny Tare, was a fantastic reporter, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  got a leaked memo that said, hey, there's 270 plus of these sites in Maine and there's another [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  800 in other parts of the country. And that caught my eye. I grew up in Maine, spent my whole life in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=128.48s)]
*  Maine, and I figured if there were 270 sites in Maine where this criminal activity was occurring, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=134.16s)]
*  I would be able to find it. And so I contacted Jenny and I worked with her and eventually got [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=139.92s)]
*  more information about some of these sites that she knew about, identified the property owners, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=145.6s)]
*  and we visited some of the sites, started identifying some of the patterns. And I basically [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=150.72s)]
*  looked at every mortgage record for the past six or seven years in every county in the state of Maine [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=157.6s)]
*  and all the electrical records for electrical upgrades, for commercial-grade power, which is [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=164.4s)]
*  required for these marijuana grows, some other financial records and mortgage documents, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=170.56s)]
*  and was able to identify well over 300 Chinese marijuana grows unlicensed operating in the state [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  of Maine just from looking at records and piecing the puzzle together and then decided I need to go [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=182.24s)]
*  visit them to see what the story is and to confirm it. And so I drove, I mean, easily 10,000 or more [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=187.76s)]
*  miles around the state of Maine to very, very distant remote places, schools, factories, former [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=193.84s)]
*  shoe factories, former scrap metal yards. You know, there's- [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  The detritus of the industrial economy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=205.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You know, there's one of these next to my high school basketball coach's house, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=208.16s)]
*  one of these next to, you know, the guy who ended up marrying my high school girlfriend. He's got [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=213.36s)]
*  a Chinese marijuana grow next to him. There's a Chinese marijuana grow next to the first place [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=219.76s)]
*  that I got drunk with my high school friends. There's a Chinese marijuana grow on my camp road [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=224.0s)]
*  that has since been busted. There's a Chinese marijuana grow on my dad's road in St. Albans. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  They're everywhere. They're in former schools, former nursing homes, and we were able to find [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=234.32s)]
*  them. It was easy to find. And it turned out that one of the first things I would do when I showed [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=238.88s)]
*  up and scoped something out, I mean, you can smell it, you can see the upgraded electrical work, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=243.76s)]
*  you can see the license plate out front from New York City. And you go and you talk with the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=248.72s)]
*  neighbors and the neighbors, you know, you just knock on the door and say, hey, I'd like to talk [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  to you about your neighbors. And they kind of get this look in their eye, like, finally, like, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=258.32s)]
*  finally somebody wants to come like hear what we've been going through, what we've been seeing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=262.8s)]
*  And they're eager to share their story. And the story is always that in the middle of COVID, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=267.76s)]
*  a young couple that spoke decent English, were of Asian descent, showed up, bought the house, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=272.8s)]
*  came over, introduced themselves, gave them a bottle of wine or a bottle of cognac, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=279.12s)]
*  and introduced themselves and said, you know, we're getting away from Boston or we're getting [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=284.32s)]
*  away from New York because of COVID. And, you know, this is just going to be our family getaway. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=288.24s)]
*  And then they never saw that couple again. And from then on, it was a steady stream of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=293.36s)]
*  other individuals of Asian descent who did not speak English, were not personable, seldom left [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=299.04s)]
*  the house. And every 30 to 40 days, a U-Haul would arrive, usually at dark hours, you know, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=304.0s)]
*  3am, 4am, and be there for about an hour and leave. And then there obviously was the smell of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=310.56s)]
*  cannabis, very pungent and all the windows blacked out and the electrical work and odd chemicals [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=316.56s)]
*  being dumped in the backyard and some other indicators. Sometimes they would burn to the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=321.84s)]
*  ground because they were trying to pass through too much electricity through. But I guess it was [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=326.0s)]
*  a period of seven or eight months I spent driving all around the state of Maine and seeing story [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=331.76s)]
*  after story after story and interviewing all of these people and seeing how scared people were, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=337.84s)]
*  how terrified people were, how well known the story was amongst people. Why were people afraid? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=342.32s)]
*  They were for a number of reasons, I think. I think there were some people who were afraid of being [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=348.88s)]
*  called racist. Everyone in Maine is afraid of being called racist, I've noticed. It's the main [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  weakness of the state. What I found was the exact opposite. I found that they were willing to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=359.04s)]
*  tolerate behavior from their Chinese neighbors that they would never have tolerated from Irish [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=364.72s)]
*  or French or English neighbors. Like absolutely, you know, illegal dumping, breaking the transformer [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  every other week and causing blackouts in the neighborhood. They would never have tolerated [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=376.48s)]
*  this behavior from white neighbors, but because of this inclination to not be smeared as a racist, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=379.68s)]
*  they were willing to tolerate it. But they were also scared because they knew the signs of a [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=387.12s)]
*  criminal organization. They knew what was going on. And the marijuana economy in Maine is big. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  It's bigger than blueberries, potatoes, and lobsters. So there are enough people in the industry [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=400.48s)]
*  who are talking about this. And so there was this kind of secret hidden knowledge of what was [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=405.6s)]
*  happening in this state, but it was like, you can't talk about it. I'm a little bit confused for a [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=410.16s)]
*  couple. I mean, there's so many questions. I'm glad we have time. Maine has effectively legalized [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  marijuana. Okay. So there are weed and some kind of criminal enterprise has funded all these weed [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  dispensaries, medical marijuana dispensaries are in every town. They're the only new buildings in [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=430.24s)]
*  those towns, as you well know. And the idea, the way that was sold, your dog's getting mad about [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=434.08s)]
*  this. He's very upset with what's happening to Maine. The way this was sold to Maine voters was [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=441.68s)]
*  we're going to take the crime out of marijuana. Like we're going to regulate it. If you want [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=449.68s)]
*  marijuana, you want cannabis, you can go and get it. It's got no weird chemicals. It's going to be safer. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=454.96s)]
*  It's going to be safer. Yeah. And the tax money too. The tax money is our schools are going to be so [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=458.88s)]
*  much better. Our streets will be safer. There'll be so much more revenue for all these wonderful [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=463.44s)]
*  things. No bigger group of liars than the marijuana peddlers. I have to know they're liars. I know a [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=467.6s)]
*  lot of them are liars. Anyway, whatever. This is the opposite of what was promised, correct? Yes. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=470.8s)]
*  I think that we unintentionally created a system that was so ripe for exploitation by criminal [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=477.04s)]
*  groups that you have to wonder if it was done intentionally. So why would they, I mean, there's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=484.96s)]
*  so much marijuana in Maine. Everyone you know grows marijuana in Maine. Its value's fallen [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=490.08s)]
*  dramatically. I don't know what they're selling an ounce of weed for right now, but like not. You [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=496.4s)]
*  can stuff your mattress for it. Forty or $50. That's crazy. If it's triad weed. Forty or $50 an ounce. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=499.52s)]
*  If it's triad weed. I don't smoke marijuana, but I did as a child. In 1983, it was $100 an ounce. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=505.2s)]
*  In 1983 dollars. So it's dramatically cheaper than it ever was. So what's the motive for illegal weed [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=511.12s)]
*  grows? Well, they have the advantage of not paying taxes, no regulatory compliance. They're [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=517.84s)]
*  not paying their labor a significant amount of money. They're using pesticides and fungicides [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=527.0400000000001s)]
*  illegally that reduce their product loss. They can also export marijuana. About two-thirds of [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=531.52s)]
*  the product that they grow illegally leaves the state of Maine. Legal growers aren't allowed to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=538.64s)]
*  do that because it's not federally legal yet. So they can sell into black markets like New York [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=542.08s)]
*  for a period of time, which was a black market early on into Maine's development of triad weed. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  Later it was a gray market where they legalized it, but didn't really have a formal system for [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=554.0s)]
*  the sale of marijuana products. So anytime you can bring your product from Maine to a black market [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=558.32s)]
*  state, you're going to get three or four times the price. And this is something that a Chinese [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=564.48s)]
*  criminal organization can do, but the mom and pop trying to run a cannabis edible store or whatever [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=569.28s)]
*  can't do. They can't export their product out of state. So if you have all these built-in cost [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=574.48s)]
*  advantages, you can get a significant amount of money off of it. And they also consider it very [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=579.04s)]
*  low risk. And they were right to consider it low risk because when the state of Maine legalized [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=583.8399999999999s)]
*  marijuana, just like what happened in Washington state and in Oklahoma and in California, it [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  changes the culture in law enforcement. We sent a signal to law enforcement that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=595.12s)]
*  marijuana was no longer a problem. It was legal. People voted, stopped paying attention to marijuana [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=599.92s)]
*  and cops who busted significant marijuana busts were kind of laughed at like, oh, that's just pot. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=605.6s)]
*  That's legal. Why are you doing that? Fentanyl is the priority. And we also have all kinds of legal [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  marijuana grows happening and that functions as camouflage for what the Chinese are doing. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=616.4s)]
*  So it might not be the most lucrative activity, but it's pretty damn lucrative, but it's low risk, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=620.32s)]
*  very low risk for them because at worst, you're going to get arrested during a mugshot taken. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=626.96s)]
*  You're going to get $2,000 bail and you'll be released and probably never have to show up at [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=633.6800000000001s)]

*  lucrative activity that they're engaged in. So the more you learn about what's in the products, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=648.4s)]
*  the food and the drugs that you put in your mouth, the more terrifying it becomes. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=653.92s)]
*  All kinds of ingredients you can't pronounce. You don't know where they're from. You probably [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=658.88s)]
*  don't want to know actually it's bad. And the effects are obvious in people's physical health [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=663.04s)]
*  and in life expectancy. So it's probably dawned on you by now, it is critical to seek out alternatives [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=668.64s)]
*  you can trust as alternative to this synthetic garbage that people put in their mouths. We [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  strongly recommend RE Fountain from Peak. It's a clean electrolyte designed for rest. It's got [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=677.6s)]
*  triple biomass magnesium and no sugar, no artificial sweeteners, all real ingredients. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=684.64s)]

*  morning. You said there were illegal Chinese cartel grows all around where you grew up. Where [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=731.68s)]
*  did you grow up and what does your family do? I grew up in Dexter, Maine. It's kind of in the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=738.4799999999999s)]
*  center of the state, southwest Penobscot County on the border of Somerset. My mom worked in [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  hospital. She was a medical assistant. My dad worked for a period of time at Dexter Shoe until [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=751.92s)]
*  our good friend Warren Buffett bought it and closed it and ruined the town of Dexter. Then [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=757.36s)]
*  he worked in car sales for pretty much the rest of my life. Your father worked in the shoe plant? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=762.08s)]
*  Your grandfather worked in the shoe plant? Yeah, my grandfather also worked in the shoe factory as [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=767.6s)]
*  well. Dexter shoes used to be a perceived brand. Probably 800 to maybe even higher than that if [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=771.04s)]
*  you include the Milo factory. So probably well over a thousand union jobs making shoes. But Warren [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  Buffett thought that he could do it better. Did he? No. And what happened to Dexter, Maine? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=786.24s)]
*  The town has collapsed. It's scary. It's sad. It's heartbreaking to return to. The public school is [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=793.76s)]
*  the largest employer in the town. My high school, my little league baseball coach used to own [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=800.64s)]
*  one of the general convenience stores in town. Not anymore. It's owned by a member of the Patel [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=808.48s)]
*  family. Crazy Bob's Discount Tobacco also owned by a member of the Patel family. Have they made [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=815.36s)]
*  it a lot better? No. No. I knew that. Yeah. I mean, there's I think seven Chinese marijuana [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=822.0s)]
*  grows that were operating in Dexter. Despite the fact that Dexter opted out of the state's legal [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=830.88s)]
*  programs. So these were de facto illegal. You could look at them and tell that they were illegal, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=836.16s)]
*  that they weren't licensed because Dexter did not participate in that marijuana program. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=841.84s)]
*  Yet for some mysterious reason, the Dexter police know where they are and haven't taken [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=845.76s)]
*  any action on that. Wait. So the town's economy collapsed when Warren Buffett came in and over [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  time shut down the factory. And then it was invaded by people from Asia who took over the businesses [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=859.6s)]
*  and then started seven illegal marijuana grows. Seven? It didn't happen that fast. It didn't [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=868.72s)]
*  happen exactly that fast. So I think Buffett's acquisition of Dexter shoe was in like 96 or 97. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  I remember it. Yeah. And it kind of, it limped along for a little while. And there were some [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=881.28s)]
*  other attempts. There were some other businesses in Dexter. It was a town of about 4,000 people [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=886.0s)]
*  at the time. I think it's now down to 3,500. But when I go home, I don't recognize anybody [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=890.08s)]
*  in Dexter anymore. And my family, my friends for the most part have all moved away. I see Dexter in [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=896.0s)]
*  the headlines a lot for fentanyl raids and busts, but the town has really been hollowed out. And I [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=901.92s)]
*  think it was the collapse, the economic collapse and the despair in the town just created low real [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=908.16s)]
*  estate prices for entrepreneurs from foreign countries to take advantage of. Yeah. And just [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=914.16s)]
*  bleed it of whatever was left. Yeah. And we've actually, we as in the United States have created [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=922.24s)]
*  programs that help them. We've taken money from United States taxpayers to help both the, I mean, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=928.72s)]
*  we don't necessarily need to get into the Patel Hotel Cartel, but they're taking advantage of [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=936.0s)]
*  small business administration loans. And it took until just recently with the election of Trump [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=941.0400000000001s)]
*  to stop SBA loans to foreign nationals and non-citizens. I don't know why we were giving [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=945.36s)]
*  SBA loans to non-citizens. That's interesting. I just want to, because I'm familiar with what [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=950.56s)]
*  you're talking about. I just want to say emphatically that there's been not only no improvement. So [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=956.4s)]
*  these stores, which are often very often the only store in a town. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=961.68s)]
*  Best pizza, best pizza, coffee, the centerpiece of the town, the town common. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=965.76s)]
*  It's the town hall. Yeah, of course. Everybody's there. And they've been taken over almost [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=971.3599999999999s)]
*  exclusively by foreigners from the subcontinent. And they have, I've been to many of them. They've [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=976.08s)]
*  all gotten much worse, much worse selling drug paraphernalia, just garbage products, hostile. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=980.72s)]
*  Have you seen any improvement? No. And they're also, I mean, they're selling [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  cannabis product derivatives that were legalized by the farm bill that legalized hemp and [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=993.84s)]
*  unintentionally created this huge world of dodgy unregulated drugs that are available for minors. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1000.4000000000001s)]
*  In many instances, it's these specific convenience stores that are selling these hemp derived [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1006.4000000000001s)]
*  products, which are, I guess, THC or marijuana adjacent will give you kind of a similar experience, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1011.36s)]
*  but are wildly under regulated and untested dangerous. Every illegal Chinese vape is for [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1018.08s)]
*  sale. I mean, it's the most degrading thing I've ever seen. It makes me want to get a gun every [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1024.08s)]
*  time I walk into one of these places. It's such a, it's just parasitic behavior in the most obvious [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1029.68s)]
*  way and a hostile. So, um, and there's no, there's, we have no, we have no immune system as a state [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1034.8s)]
*  to repel what's happening because there's not enough capital to come in. There's no, there's [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1042.8s)]
*  no competitor to foreign money coming in with an SBA loan and buying up to its delicatessen index. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1047.36s)]
*  There, there's no one else who could possibly buy that store and there's no, and there's no [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  one who would want to frankly. So I've seen, and I hate to get sidetracked, but it's, it's such, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1057.6s)]
*  it's such a big question in rural America who runs the general store, the convenience store, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1061.6s)]
*  the gas station store, whatever you call it. It's the, it's the center of every little town. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1066.7199999999998s)]
*  And if all of a sudden in the space of five years, they're all run by non-citizens from India and [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1071.28s)]
*  they're all getting worse and they're all engaging in business practices that are almost like [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1077.9199999999998s)]
*  intentionally degrading of the people who live there. Like, no, we only sell generic cigarettes, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1082.1599999999999s)]
*  illegal Chinese vapes and some kind of weird non-regulated narcotic and bongs and crackpipes. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1086.64s)]
*  That's literally what's happening. And there's garbage piled up outside. I mean, the whole thing [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1093.3600000000001s)]
*  is like beyond belief. You have to sort of wonder like, what actually is this? Are these incredibly [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1100.88s)]
*  profitable businesses? This seems like a scam of some kind. But last thing I'll say, I know this [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1106.48s)]
*  for a fact, a lot of these places, if you look at the tax records, they trade for, you know, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1110.64s)]
*  300 grand or something, but most of the transactions off the books in cash. So they're [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1114.08s)]
*  dodging taxes actually. And they shift around from one trust to another trust and then back [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1119.1999999999998s)]
*  to another trust. There's very complicated, very complex financial schemes at play. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1124.8s)]
*  This is clearly a scam. There's a criminal scam. I don't think it's just in the state of Maine. I [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1130.48s)]
*  think it's probably all throughout. I know it's in New Hampshire as well in Vermont. What is this [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1135.1999999999998s)]
*  scam? Well, they're certainly not making money off the hotels that they operate in the general [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1139.44s)]
*  stores. If you look at a town like Lincoln, Maine, something similar has happened where one family [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1144.72s)]
*  from away, from out of state has come in and purchased competing rival gas stations. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1150.96s)]
*  But there's one gas station that's still owned by a local. And so naturally the people who know the [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1157.52s)]
*  guy who owns the store and don't know the guy who owns the other stores will go and patronize the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1162.3200000000002s)]
*  guy that they still know. So as business has declined to these other general stores, somehow [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1166.96s)]
*  they're still thriving. And initially their employees are locals and Mainers, but then [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1172.8s)]
*  eventually there's a new class of employees who are brought in, who are brought in very likely on [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1178.72s)]
*  visas, who are also from away. So I think that if you look at some of the, from India, yeah, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1183.92s)]
*  from, I think that if you look at some of the cases that have been filed, even under the Biden [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  administration against operations that look a lot like what's happening in Maine, they're immigration [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1195.04s)]
*  scams. They're using these businesses as a pretext to get SBA loans and also to get access to visa [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1200.24s)]
*  programs so that they can sell legal entry into the country to people back in. So they're selling, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1207.6s)]
*  they're selling those visas. To be clear, I don't have proof that that's happening in [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1214.6399999999999s)]
*  Lincoln or Dexter, but there are indictments in, there's one I know very well in Texas, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1219.68s)]
*  where that's exactly what was happening. It's made every town where I've seen it and it's, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1225.68s)]
*  you know, a dozen or more worse. So that's kind of, you know, okay, there are a million scams, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  but like if you roll into somebody's town and degrade it on purpose and make it much worse, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1235.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, I think that's a moral crime. And there's been no response at all. Okay. Yeah. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1241.28s)]
*  And I was actually, I was asked about a food pantry operation that they were trying to set [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1245.76s)]
*  up in Dexter. They were trying to raise some money to, you know, help give out food to poor people. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1251.76s)]
*  And I asked, you know, how much of the new owners of Dexter Variety and Toots Delicatessen contributed [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1258.32s)]
*  to this charity operation, you know, their new pillars of our community and small business owners, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1263.6s)]
*  how much have they given? And I was never given a very good answer on that. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1268.24s)]
*  Yeah, the answer is zero, of course. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1271.04s)]
*  So you may have seen a recent story about a smartphone that got smuggled out of North Korea. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1272.48s)]
*  The device is programmed automatically to take a screenshot every five minutes. So the government [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1276.16s)]

*  state. So that seems like something that only happens in North Korea, but unfortunately it's [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1287.2s)]
*  not. It happens here too, all over the so-called free world. In the United States, for example, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1293.2s)]
*  data brokers monitor everybody's online activity, what you read, click, buy, more, everything you do, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1298.56s)]
*  and then sell information about you without your knowledge or permission to advertisers, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1304.6399999999999s)]
*  even data scammers, and by the way, other governments. ExpressVPN is a way for you to [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1308.24s)]
*  fight back. ExpressVPN is an easy to use service that hides your IP address and encrypts all your [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1313.12s)]
*  internet traffic that makes it unreadable to people who would steal your information and then [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1318.3999999999999s)]
*  sell it. It works on every device. A single subscription covers up to eight devices. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1322.96s)]
*  Tech experts consistently rank ExpressVPN among America's top VPN services. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1328.0s)]
*  There's a reason for that. You get an extra four months of ExpressVPN for free just by scanning [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1332.88s)]
*  the QR code on the screen or go to expressvpn.com slash Tucker and get your four extra months for [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1337.92s)]

*  subsidizing this, what's happening here. About, I would say, a third of the properties in the [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1352.96s)]
*  state of Maine that would go on to become illegal Chinese marijuana grow houses were purchased [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1360.4s)]
*  using mortgages through a program called the Community Development Finance Institution. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1366.72s)]
*  It's a designation that you give to banks. The entire purpose of the program is to help [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1372.24s)]
*  marginalized communities access financing. The idea is that if you were an immigrant in the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1377.76s)]
*  1990s, you couldn't prove regular income. You had irregular finances and trouble accessing a mortgage. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1384.8799999999999s)]
*  So they created this special program to take away some of the risk from the lender. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1392.56s)]
*  So there's one bank in New York, Quantik Bank, that has the CDFI designation and on their website [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1396.56s)]
*  they advertise that they'll help non-citizens, foreign nationals, buy property in the United [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1402.4s)]
*  States. This bank advertised on- I'm trying not to use the F word. Why would we be helping foreign [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1408.16s)]
*  nationals buy in places where there's a housing crisis and the people who are born there can't [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1413.0400000000002s)]
*  find a house to live in? What is going on? And then why under COVID would we [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1418.5600000000002s)]
*  supercharge the program with an additional tranche of funding? Why would we put that program on [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1424.4s)]
*  steroids? I don't know. I know that it was exploited. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1430.24s)]
*  Because you want to kill and replace the people who populate your country. That's why. Replace [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1435.68s)]
*  them with other people. Obviously. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1439.92s)]
*  Yeah. In looking at the mortgage records, having to actually look at the physical records themselves, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1441.36s)]
*  I cottoned on to this Quantik Bank pattern. And it's just a quirk of how the Registry of Deeds [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1448.4s)]
*  records work that you can search by the lender. And so I searched Quantik Bank just to see, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1456.32s)]
*  do they loan to everybody or are they just suddenly a new domain? And I would say 95% [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  of their loans were post-2019 and exclusively to people with Chinese names from New York and [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1469.84s)]
*  from Boston. And in further reviewing those records, I found that there were two individuals, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1476.32s)]
*  two loan officers who were originating almost all of those loans, 95% of those loans. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1481.6s)]
*  And one was a Taiwanese national and the other was a Chinese national who graduated from a [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1488.8s)]
*  university in China that's affiliated with the PRC's economic warfare program. And I actually [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1492.9599999999998s)]
*  got phone interviews with them. They're on our X page. You can go listen to them. I asked Ying [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1498.08s)]
*  Shan Wang, I said, did you know that these properties of all these loans that you're doing [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1501.76s)]
*  were becoming illegal marijuana grow houses? She said, what? No, no way. Well, I'll have to [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1504.8s)]
*  say something about this. We'll have to put a stop to this. Did they? I don't know. I'm unaware. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1512.1599999999999s)]
*  I am unaware. I know that there's been a lot of letters written by politicians about the CDFI [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1519.04s)]
*  program, about why we're doing this, but the horses left the barn at this point. I mean, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1524.8s)]
*  they have the properties now and they have the means to generate as much cash as they want. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1530.0s)]
*  This was a gold rush in Maine. That's what it was. When we legalized marijuana, there was a vote in [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1534.96s)]
*  2016. The state came out and said, yes, we want adult use marijuana legalized. They formalized [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1542.48s)]
*  the program in 2020 and created an adult use program and a medicinal program, which are very [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1548.48s)]
*  distinct. The medicinal program is vastly under-regulated compared to the adult use [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1553.84s)]
*  recreational program, which is counterintuitive, but the medicinal program is like the Wild, Wild [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1561.36s)]
*  West. When we did this, we created just a pig scramble for a $5 to $10 billion market for this [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1565.4399999999998s)]
*  drug. The forces that we unleashed and the forces that were brought to Baron, Maine to access that [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1575.12s)]
*  money, we weren't prepared for. The local police weren't prepared for it. The sheriffs [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1581.76s)]
*  weren't prepared for it. No, because they were told this was going to solve the crime problem [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1587.76s)]
*  associated with illegal drugs. If you legalize something, there's no more crime. In 2021 in [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1592.72s)]
*  Turner, Maine at 57 Conan Road, there's a hanger right next to Twitchell Airport. It's a disused [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1600.16s)]
*  airport. The police have been there many, many times. We got police records from early 2021 [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1606.64s)]
*  where they had been called there for what they were told was a hostage situation. When the police [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1612.8000000000002s)]
*  show up, there's Chinese individuals who only speak Cantonese running out in the woods, total [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1618.0800000000002s)]
*  chaos. They can't really discern what exactly is going on, but it's a civil dispute and they decide [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1622.5600000000002s)]
*  it's not their problem. In their notes, they say that they believe the property is under the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1626.88s)]
*  control of a quote, Chinese gang from New York. That was in early 2021. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1631.28s)]
*  That was in their notes? In the incident report, they say that they believe- [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1636.3999999999999s)]
*  Wasn't it their job to do something about it? You think? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1640.6399999999999s)]
*  There's never been any arrests made in connection with that facility, which functioned according to [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1645.36s)]
*  the state police as an illicit marijuana grow controlled by Chinese gangs from New York. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1650.6399999999999s)]
*  The office of cannabis policy, which regulates all of this has suspended numerous licenses for Chinese [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1655.28s)]
*  marijuana growers from out of state who are affiliated with that property. There's never been [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1660.0s)]
*  any arrests made at that property until December, last December, a guy named William Robinson, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1664.08s)]
*  no relation, was shot in the head there by a drug dealer. The guy who shot him was later, allegedly, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1671.12s)]
*  was later arrested hiding at a marina in San Diego. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1680.0s)]
*  You say there are, you believe, around 300 Chinese gang controlled drug operations in Maine. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1682.72s)]
*  There are grow houses, there are flop houses, there are prostitution houses masquerading as [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1693.6000000000001s)]
*  massage parlors, there are some, I guess, financial hubs that you might say in Kittery and Old Orchard [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1701.44s)]
*  Beach and southern parts of the state. There are other facilities that seem distinctly militaristic [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1709.92s)]
*  in character. What does that mean? Your hair stands up on end when you go by. I've knocked [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1717.52s)]
*  on the doors of a lot of marijuana facilities, but in Greenbush, in Greenbush, Maine, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1723.2s)]
*  Where is that? It's about 35 minutes north of Bangor, very rural, but there's an area where [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1728.8000000000002s)]
*  there are multiple adjacent properties, all controlled, all fenced off, motion sensors on [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1736.1599999999999s)]
*  the road so that they know if someone's coming well in advance. Blue-collar workers I've talked [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1741.6799999999998s)]
*  with who have had to come out and do some service at those properties have talked about being [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1748.24s)]
*  surveilled by crews of eight young Chinese men, close crop haircuts, fatigues. Fatigues? What [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1753.12s)]
*  there was described to me as fatigues, standing around the perimeter of the property and when [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1762.48s)]
*  they need to access the property to do some load testing, if they're, for example, an electrical [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1767.92s)]
*  worker, they're physically stopped and prevented from accessing the property and they're escorted [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1772.24s)]
*  off the property and two crisp $100 bills tucked into their back pocket and they say coffee money, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1777.84s)]
*  coffee money, coffee money, and they push them off the property. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1783.04s)]
*  Things are completely out of control in Maine, obviously. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1788.96s)]
*  Completely out of control. I should say for the record, prettiest state out of 50, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1792.64s)]
*  nicest people, lowest crime rate for my whole life, 56, so a long time. And you're describing [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1797.84s)]
*  something really, really dark. How many of those facilities have been shut down by state or local [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1808.4s)]
*  law enforcement? It depends on what you mean by shut down. You can execute a search warrant on [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1815.2s)]
*  one of these facilities. You can go in, you can arrest some people, you can destroy their plants, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1822.08s)]
*  but the very next day it can get spun up and all they have to say is that they're getting a license, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1827.36s)]
*  they're in the process of getting a license to operate legally and then law enforcement can't [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1832.6399999999999s)]
*  touch them. I saw this exact same, this exact thing happened in Franklin County. There was a [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1836.96s)]
*  raid at a location in New Sharon and I showed up the following day because I wanted to get, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1843.28s)]
*  I wanted to document it and there was a big white truck from Grow Generation, which is a [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1848.16s)]
*  marijuana growing supply company, a fairly big one in Maine, backed up and there was a crew of [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1853.8400000000001s)]
*  workers offloading material. So it had been raided the day before by the sheriffs and the following [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1858.0800000000002s)]
*  day they're spinning it right back up. And I emailed the sheriff and said, hey, just so you know, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1863.28s)]
*  these guys are right back at it. I'm watching them. You can come over here. And he said they say [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1868.88s)]
*  they're getting a license now so I can't touch them. And what we learned in January. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1874.24s)]
*  . . . So if I get pulled over without a driver's license and I say I'm going to get a driver's [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1879.04s)]
*  license, they let me go? I don't think so. No, no. They take my car actually. So how is that, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1884.0s)]
*  I mean, with respect, with actually with no respect at all to the sheriff you're referring to, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1890.32s)]
*  how is that? Like how is that? So it's kind of genius the way they've set up the scheme in that [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1894.8s)]
*  the property owner is never the one who is there growing the marijuana or picking up the marijuana [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1901.36s)]
*  or trafficking the marijuana. And so they're never held culpable for the activity happening [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1907.28s)]
*  at their property because they can always have plausible deniability. Oh, I was renting to my [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1912.3999999999999s)]
*  cousin. I was renting to a stranger. I found this guy on WeChat and rented the property to him. I [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1916.3999999999999s)]
*  had no idea this was going on. I'm so upset that this is happening. Thank you, law enforcement, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1921.84s)]
*  for doing this for us. So in January, the director of the Office of Cannabis Policy, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1925.92s)]
*  handpicked by Governor Janet Mills, a guy named John Hudak, admitted. What's his name? John Hudak. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1933.92s)]
*  John Hudak. He came from Colorado. He has a long career. He's been a huge success there, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1940.8000000000002s)]
*  the cannabis legalization. He's been involved in cannabis policy. Brookings. He totally destroyed [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1947.28s)]
*  Denver. He came from the Brookings Institute. If you use Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, then you're [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1951.92s)]
*  overpaying for your phone. That's just a fact. The companies don't want you to hear that, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1958.3200000000002s)]
*  but it's absolutely true. Why is that? Well, think about it. Your monthly payment [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1961.28s)]
*  funds thousands of retail stores, their retail stores you're never going to go to. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1965.04s)]
*  You're also probably paying for unnecessary perks you'll never use. There's a better way. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1970.0800000000002s)]
*  Buy what you need. It's called Peer Talk. Peer Talk uses the same 5G networks as those other [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1974.4s)]
*  companies, literally the same cell tower, so it's not off grid or done with a wire between cans. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1981.2s)]
*  It's the highest tech available, but Peer Talk doesn't charge for the add-ons that send most [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1987.28s)]
*  bills to the roof. Instead, Peer Talk gives you unlimited talk, tax, plenty of data for 25 bucks [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1992.32s)]
*  a month. 25 bucks a month is probably less than half what you're paying. You get the same service, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=1998.48s)]
*  exact same service. Go to puretalk.com slash Tucker. You save an additional 50% off your first month. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2003.52s)]
*  The switch can take less than 10 minutes. They do not hassle you, and you don't have to switch your [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2009.36s)]

*  Hudak, H-U-D-A-K. John Hudak. Okay. And he is in front of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2024.3999999999999s)]
*  testifying for the first time this year of this session, and he admits that he's been giving [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2033.76s)]
*  medicinal marijuana licenses to individuals that he suspects have ties to Chinese organized crime, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2039.5200000000002s)]
*  or he's giving licenses to people who provide addresses for their grows at properties that [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2046.16s)]
*  have been previously raided for their connections to Chinese organized crime. And his hands are [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2051.52s)]
*  tied. There's nothing that he can do about it. He somehow finds a way... How about say no? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2056.0s)]
*  That would be racist. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2061.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the state has no immune system. That's exactly right. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2062.56s)]
*  There's no immune system. We have no defense. And if you look at like, where I'm from, Dexter, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2068.16s)]
*  you have Dexter, Ripley, Cornyn, Cambridge, all these towns, three different counties represented, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2073.7599999999998s)]
*  but you've got one criminal group that's operating in three different counties. So three different [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2077.2799999999997s)]
*  sheriffs have jurisdiction and multiple different local police departments. And some of these towns [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2082.48s)]
*  don't even have police departments, but they're not, as a matter of course, sharing intelligence. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2086.88s)]
*  In order to take down a criminal operation that's straddling three counties, you need to get [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2092.8s)]
*  cooperation amongst these three sheriffs who don't just always cooperate. So it requires a [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2098.1600000000003s)]
*  Herculean effort amongst law enforcement to coordinate one of these crackdowns or one of [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2104.4s)]
*  these raids that are going to be effective at actually arresting people, detaining people who [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2109.04s)]
*  could be witnesses, who could explain more about what's ultimately happening. But by and large, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2113.84s)]
*  there's no effective enforcement and the Maine state police have been AWOL. Totally AWOL. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2120.72s)]
*  So just to be, I just want to make sure I understand this. You were tipped off the story [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2130.8799999999997s)]
*  by a Daily Caller News Foundation reporter who had a state generated list. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2134.7999999999997s)]
*  CBP. This was generated by Customs and Border Protection. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2140.48s)]
*  I'm so sorry. Okay. So it was the feds, but it was, I mean, a government agency identified. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2143.12s)]
*  These places. So it's not like you're just guessing. And the Maine state police, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2150.72s)]
*  that was a couple of years ago. They've done nothing. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2156.72s)]
*  They've been involved in three raids and two of them were in Belgrade, about a mile from the [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2159.2799999999997s)]
*  state police headquarters. And the reason they raided those is because six months before we [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2166.24s)]
*  started drawing attention to them, one of their troopers had been inside, seen 500 or 600 marijuana [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2172.72s)]
*  plants, talked to the Chinese individual who voluntarily let the trooper in. So all this is [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2178.8s)]
*  admissible. Talked to the Department of Agriculture, talked to the Office of Cannabis Policy, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2183.52s)]
*  confirmed that it was an illegal grow and didn't do anything to it for six months and allowed it [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2188.4s)]
*  to continue to operate. So it's my belief that those two operations in Belgrade were CYA. They [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2192.48s)]
*  didn't want it later to look like a cover up on their part. So this is just corruption. I mean, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2198.4s)]
*  you're describing corruption. What else explains it? The governor of this state has yet to utter [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2203.12s)]
*  a single word about a vast criminal conspiracy operating in her state as a result of this [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2211.3599999999997s)]
*  conspiracy. We don't even know how many people have been killed. In Freedom, Maine, there was a house, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2216.48s)]
*  555 Belfast Road, been busted by the sheriff out there for functioning as an illegal marijuana grow, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2223.3599999999997s)]
*  subsequently turned into a flop house and there was a carbon monoxide poisoning incident. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2229.52s)]
*  There were, we think, four or five Chinese migrants living there, poisoned by carbon [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2234.64s)]
*  monoxide, hospitalized, two of them died. Somehow, the exhaust of the heater just [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2240.48s)]
*  piped back in through the window. It was an accident, officially, on paper, is what law [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2249.36s)]
*  enforcement have determined. Somehow, the propane heater, the breeze must have caught it and piped [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2253.12s)]
*  it back in through the window. There was no outpouring of progressive goodwill or mourning [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2258.56s)]
*  for these poor Chinese migrants who died at a flop house in Freedom, Maine. But, I mean, it was [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2265.52s)]
*  an attempted mass murder, in my opinion. There's no way the exhaust just accidentally pipes back [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2270.88s)]
*  into the house. No, this was an attempted hit on Chinese migrant workers at a flop house. This was [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2278.56s)]
*  triad on triad violence, which we've seen, we've documented. There have been burglaries. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2284.72s)]
*  There was the shooting I just talked about at the Marijuana Grow in Turner. That individual, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2289.52s)]
*  after he shot, who was his friend in the head, turned to one of the witnesses, who I've talked [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2296.24s)]
*  with, and said that he was a hired hitman for the triad and that there were 40 more just like him. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2301.4399999999996s)]
*  Maybe he watched too many video games or too many movies or whatever and he was lying or [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2308.72s)]
*  maybe he was telling the truth. I don't know. So there's more than one Chinese criminal organization. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2314.72s)]
*  There are multiple families for sure. Multiple regions, I think, is safe to say. Yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2320.8799999999997s)]
*  And the governor has not said one word about this? No. Who is the governor? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2328.16s)]
*  Janet Mills. She was an attorney general under Governor Paul LePage. She was a district attorney [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2332.3999999999996s)]
*  before that. She's been a government employee for basically her entire life, came out of Farmington. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2339.9199999999996s)]
*  Dropped out of Colby. She claims on her own free will and then graduated from the University of [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2345.04s)]
*  Massachusetts in 1970, although she's not listed in the program for that graduation ceremony. It's [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2351.52s)]
*  the weirdest thing. But she's been governor now for about six, seven years. So it makes you wonder [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2357.52s)]
*  what is her position on illegal drugs, which are destroying the state. I think any fair person [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2367.6s)]
*  would say that. Yeah. The state under Governor Mills has embraced restorative justice and [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2372.0s)]
*  harm reduction and the idea that if you stop enforcing laws against drugs and you pass out [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2379.52s)]
*  needles and Narcan, that that is going to be good for society. I think the plain objective evidence [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2386.88s)]
*  is that that's been a complete failure. But on the, I guess the Chinese criminal conspiracy in [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2396.4s)]
*  the state, we've approached her at events and tried to ask her about it and she won't answer [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2402.7200000000003s)]
*  questions directly. Why? So that's the million dollar question. So do you have any evidence [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2408.08s)]
*  that suggests a motive for ignoring something this destructive? Well, part of it could just be ego. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2416.0s)]
*  It could just be that it's the main wire and it's, we are the conservative outlet in the state. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2423.68s)]
*  And maybe if she acknowledges the problem of Chinese criminal organizations in this state, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2429.7599999999998s)]
*  it's in some way validating the work that we've done to expose the problem. And if you accept [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2434.72s)]
*  that the work that we've done on Chinese criminal organizations in the state is legitimate, valuable [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2439.52s)]
*  journalism, then you have to ask, well, what about the other investigative projects that we've worked [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2445.12s)]
*  on, which I also think are valuable journalism for the state. So maybe it's just a simple- [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2450.0s)]
*  The only journalism in the state, let me just correct you, the only journalism in the state. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2455.36s)]
*  Well, all due respect to your friend, Steve Collins. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2460.24s)]
*  There's really, there's no journalism in Maine at all. 1.3 million people, largest state, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2463.44s)]
*  New England, bigger than the other five New England states combined. I mean, it's a real place. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2468.88s)]
*  No journalism. A lot of stenography. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2473.04s)]
*  What you're doing and propaganda. But so I'm just, but I'm interested, like that's a huge [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2475.6s)]
*  footprint across a huge state. So a lot of people know this is going on and she hasn't said word one, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2482.4s)]
*  much less done anything to stop it. It does feel like someone's getting paid. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2488.88s)]
*  I am increasingly of the belief that there's a lot of bribes being paid in the state. Small, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2495.36s)]
*  stuff to code enforcement officers, police departments. It's really the only way that [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2503.52s)]
*  explains the lack of action. And we were, we did discover in reviewing property records, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2507.6000000000004s)]
*  there was a raid. This was in 2024 in February that kind of targeted the area around my hometown, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2513.52s)]
*  the town that my mom grew up in. I mean, from this marijuana house that was rated in Carina, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2522.48s)]
*  you can see the church that my brother was married in and that my grandmother used to go to. It's a [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2526.32s)]
*  big, beautiful Maine house that will probably have to be destroyed now because of the poisons [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2531.36s)]
*  and the mold and everything that afflicted the house as a result of it becoming a marijuana [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2535.76s)]
*  grow. But there was this coordinated raid with the sheriffs, very effective law enforcement action. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2539.6s)]
*  And in the days after that, there was a real estate transfer done for a property in Carina, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2545.04s)]
*  Maine in the same town for a 12 acre property, a tear down, really like a hunting camp. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2550.08s)]
*  And it was a transfer of a property from a Chinese woman living in Massachusetts [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2555.76s)]
*  to another Chinese person living in Guangdong province, China. So it struck me as unusual. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2561.92s)]
*  Oh, did it? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2569.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2570.2400000000002s)]
*  A little weird? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2570.7400000000002s)]
*  It was a little weird. And then on the real estate transfer document, it said [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2571.52s)]
*  this was a gift to mother. And my mom was from Carina. And so I thought to myself, if I told my [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2576.32s)]
*  mom that for Mother's Day, I was giving her 12 acres and a tear down in Carina, Maine, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2583.52s)]
*  she would probably slap me. So again, this is an unusual gift to your mother. But what really struck [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2587.92s)]
*  me as unusual about it was the fact that the attorney who processed the real estate transfer [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2593.68s)]
*  was Paul Mills of Farmington, Maine, who was the older brother of Governor Janet Mills. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2598.48s)]
*  What? Wait, the governor's brother is involved in this? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2602.88s)]
*  The governor's brother has been involved in notarizing deeds for individuals connected [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2606.88s)]
*  to Chinese organized crime and was the real estate transfer attorney specifically for this property, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2614.4s)]
*  which he helped transfer as a gift to the ownership of a Chinese national who owns [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2620.4s)]
*  multiple marijuana grows in the state of Maine. And it was done days after a law enforcement action [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2626.4s)]
*  in that area. That's shocking. That's shocking. Here's a depressing but true statistic. Nearly [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2635.04s)]

*  I called Paul Mills and told him that I was from Massachusetts. I was looking to do a gift transfer [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2721.8399999999997s)]

*  and he told me that he didn't do work in that area. But you had evidence he had just done work [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2734.3999999999996s)]
*  in that area. So if you had said, I'm calling from Guangdong province and I'd like to open another [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2739.84s)]

*  or maybe it was an element of Chinese culture where they think that they need to pay some kind [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2756.48s)]

*  When have they done that before? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2766.72s)]
*  But actually, I called Paul Mills as myself and we had a 10 minute interview about this property, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2770.0s)]
*  and he said that a friend asked him to do it and I couldn't remember who. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2779.04s)]

*  He's the governor's brother, the sitting governor. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2788.0s)]

*  house and we passed out, I printed out 50 copies of this real estate transfer record and I passed [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2814.08s)]
*  them out to politicians, I passed them out to other reporters. I sat in the governor's lobby [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2818.64s)]
*  with a camera focused right on the door, just waiting for an interview and they actually [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2822.8s)]

*  I was like South Korea flying over North Korea, dropping flyers, trying to get people to pay [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2839.52s)]

*  No. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2848.8s)]

*  that suggests such a deep level of coordination and terrifying corruption. I mean, are you worried [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2855.7000000000003s)]
*  for your safety? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2862.1800000000003s)]

*  Of course. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2873.94s)]
*  You know, what exactly is the- [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2874.7400000000002s)]
*  If they're allowing Chinese drug cartels to control huge swaths of rural Maine and people [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2877.06s)]
*  are dying, a governor herself is saying not one thing, we're trying to stop it and the entire [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2882.34s)]
*  rest of the state's media is ignoring it. That sounds like a level of corruption that's like, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2887.14s)]
*  would have been unimaginable in this country five years ago even. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2892.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2895.54s)]
*  And if you're the one guy saying something about it, which you are, I don't know. I mean, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2897.06s)]
*  where does that leave you? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2903.06s)]
*  Before I'd even reported anything on this, I had an Excel spreadsheet working on a database, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2903.94s)]
*  keeping track of records of sites we'd flagged from financial records, tax records, electrical [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2911.54s)]
*  records, sites we'd visited and confirmed, sites where we talked with the neighbors. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2916.58s)]
*  And at that point, I'd identified maybe 150 or 175 of these sites and actually sent it to the [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2920.98s)]
*  Bangor Daily News because I hadn't reported anything about it. But I was scared. And I thought [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2926.02s)]
*  that if we all reported it at the same time, it would kind of diffuse the attention. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2937.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2941.7s)]
*  And I was willing to give up the, I guess, whatever, the prestige of being the one who gets the scoop [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2942.2s)]
*  to have us all come forward and report on this problem. And they've never used it. They've never [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2947.54s)]
*  reported on it. They've never touched it. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2952.98s)]
*  How? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2954.02s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, it's just maybe their pride of not relying on, you know, I'm not a [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2955.14s)]
*  journalism school graduate, so maybe they don't want to use it or some dirty trick by the [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2960.5s)]
*  conservative media that I'm trying to pull on them, but they haven't used it. And I, at the [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2965.94s)]
*  same time- [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2969.46s)]
*  Because it reflects poorly on the democratic administration that runs the state. Maybe that's- [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2969.86s)]
*  That's a- [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2974.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2975.46s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's a, sometimes the simplest explanation is the correct one. It's also could [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2976.1s)]
*  just be laziness, a lack of curiosity. And this is a story that can't be told merely sitting or [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2982.18s)]
*  discovered merely sitting behind your computer. You know, you have to actually be going out and [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2988.58s)]
*  talking to people and knocking on doors and taking some risks. It was around the same time, though, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2993.7s)]
*  that after I'd been out like the entire day, knocking on fields a lot in Madison and that area, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=2998.3399999999997s)]
*  and beautiful town. It used to be. And I realized, I was like, man, this is a real [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3006.98s)]
*  vast conspiracy. And it just kind of dawned on me how insane this entire thing was, that this was [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3015.78s)]
*  being allowed to happen in Maine. And I was like, law enforcement has to be on this. And I don't [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3021.62s)]
*  want to be the guy who comes along and reports on this and like dicks up this big investigation [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3027.94s)]
*  that they're about to close the loop on. So I drove to the Maine state police headquarters [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3032.98s)]
*  and I walked in with my laptop and I told the receptionist, I have evidence of a vast criminal [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3036.98s)]
*  conspiracy currently operating in the state of Maine. And I would just like to turn over some [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3041.94s)]
*  information to somebody, to anybody, because I don't want to interfere with some active criminal [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3045.38s)]
*  investigation. And I waited in the lobby for 15 minutes. And then some woman came out and said, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3052.34s)]
*  there's nobody here who can talk to you. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3058.66s)]
*  And I contacted the- [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3059.94s)]
*  Where was this? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3064.42s)]
*  This is right in Augusta, the Department of Public Safety building. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3066.18s)]
*  Augusta is the capital of the state? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3070.18s)]
*  Yeah. And then I contacted the- [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3071.62s)]
*  There's nobody here who can talk to you? This is in the public safety building in the state [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3074.82s)]
*  capital and you say, I have evidence of a vast criminal conspiracy. And you're a sober sane [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3078.7400000000002s)]

*  you are. And no one can talk to you? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3088.82s)]
*  Granted, it was 425. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3094.34s)]
*  Oh yeah, right. Okay. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3095.94s)]
*  It might've been a Friday, so they'd probably clocked out by that time. But I contacted the [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3098.1800000000003s)]
*  director of communications for the state police and reiterated what I'd said. And I contacted [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3102.82s)]
*  some other members of the state police that I knew through family connections, some fairly high [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3108.1000000000004s)]
*  ranking who used to be very big fans of mine when they heard me on conservative talk radio, but [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3113.78s)]
*  don't want to talk to me anymore. And reiterated what I'd said. And the communications director [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3117.7s)]
*  told me somebody would call me on Monday. And that must be 120 Mondays ago at this point. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3124.8199999999997s)]
*  So they have no interest in talking to me or hearing from me. The troopers I've talked with, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3134.3399999999997s)]
*  they're mystified by the decisions that their leadership are making as well. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3141.46s)]

*  And the only thing that I can do to fight back is to put a spotlight on it and to expose it. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3265.38s)]
*  It's like my riding around with my grandfather in a pickup truck in Ripley, Maine, and he sees some [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3275.14s)]
*  garbage on the side of the road and we stop and I ask him, what are we stopping for? He's like, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3282.58s)]
*  this garbage, we gotta pick it up. It's not our garbage. We didn't leave it there. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3287.3s)]
*  He's like, yeah, but I got trash bags and we got time and it's our town. This is our community. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3290.9s)]
*  You know, it's my version of that. We're taking out the trash. We're picking up our backyard. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3297.46s)]
*  That's what needs to be done. And there's no one else who's doing it. You know, I love this state. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3304.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't want it to become, you know, just like a festering gangbang for third world criminals. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3311.38s)]
*  And so it's becoming very fast, faster than I've ever seen anything change. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3316.66s)]
*  Okay, so now to the question of the watchdogs, the constitutionally protected watchdog class, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3321.3799999999997s)]
*  we call the media in Maine. There are three big papers, one in Bangor, one in Lewiston, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3328.4199999999996s)]
*  one in Vegas, in Portland, Press Herald Daily News, Sun Journal. And they, you know, they've [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3334.5s)]
*  been around a long time. They had big staffs at one point. Like where are they? Why no coverage? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3343.54s)]
*  It's blowing my mind. I mean, they'll cover something if there's a press release, you know, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3349.22s)]
*  if there's a raid that a sheriff does. I mean, Sheriff Dale Lancaster in Somerset County is [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3356.18s)]
*  probably the best sheriff in the state of Maine, probably the best law enforcement official in the [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3363.3s)]
*  state of Maine. Old school, no excuses, no BS, kicking doors in. You know, he's been responsible [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3368.98s)]
*  for the vast majority of the successful search warrants that have been executed and a lot of [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3376.66s)]
*  the arrests. He's been very successful and he'll put out a press release and there'll be some [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3382.7400000000002s)]
*  coverage, but they, you know, they'll be very careful not to note any of the patterns. You know, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3388.82s)]
*  they're very diligent about not recognizing the patterns. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3395.94s)]
*  You've already done the reporting. Like you've put online and unfortunately since it's Maine [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3398.9s)]
*  and it's considered far away and remote and people don't pay attention, it hasn't gotten the coverage [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3404.02s)]
*  it deserves in my opinion, but you've put the facts out there. Like they can follow up on that [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3407.46s)]
*  at any moment and they decided not to. So, you know, reprinting press releases is not journalism. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3412.9s)]
*  Of course, it's a transcription service. Who owns the media in Maine? Like who's responsible for this [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3418.34s)]
*  deliberately ignoring a crisis? So the largest newspaper company currently is owned by the [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3427.86s)]
*  Maine Trust for Local News, which is a subsidiary of the National Trust for Local News, which is a [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3434.98s)]
*  a nonprofit funded by George Soros. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3441.54s)]
*  Oh, so George Soros controls the media in Maine. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3447.3s)]
*  He funds it. He specifically funded the transaction to acquire these papers from Reed Brower [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3449.7s)]
*  along with Hans-Jörg Weiss, who's a Swiss national who made his fortune [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3455.2200000000003s)]
*  doing illegal bone cement experiments on humans, who's been in trouble in the past for illegally [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3460.42s)]
*  donating as a foreign national to U.S. political candidates, so has a knack for trying to influence [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3466.9s)]
*  American politics as a foreign national. Why would George Soros want to control the media in Maine? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3471.54s)]
*  Yeah, so Maine's, going back to the 1980s, Maine's been a cheap date for people looking to trial [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3476.98s)]
*  political ideas, you know, beginning with the shutdown of Maine Yankee, our nuclear power plant. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3481.94s)]
*  There's really just three media markets, like you said, just a handful of newspapers, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3487.62s)]
*  and if you want to get a ballot initiative done or something like that, it doesn't take a lot of money. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3493.3s)]
*  So you can come to Maine and you can close a nuclear plant, you can get a gay marriage referendum [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3499.1400000000003s)]
*  passed, you can get marijuana legalized as a referendum for a small amount of money, and then [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3504.1000000000004s)]
*  you can go to another state and say, well, we've already done it in Maine, we can do it in this state, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3510.26s)]
*  and so we become kind of a petri dish for political experimentation that particularly the progressive [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3513.94s)]
*  left has taken advantage of in a very successful way. Maine was always the whitest state in the [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3520.5s)]
*  United States, has long been, and was a target for that reason too, and they said that out loud, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3526.9s)]
*  Maine's too white, and so there is a sense in which it was targeted because of its demographics. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3532.82s)]
*  I mean, they've said that, I'm not guessing, at all. Yeah, I mean, going back 30 years, I mean, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3540.02s)]
*  under Governor John Baldacci, Lewiston famously became a sanctuary city for Somalis, and... [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3543.62s)]
*  Can you describe Lewiston? What does Lewiston mean? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3552.74s)]
*  The Atlantic, I think, described it as Little Mogadishu. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3557.38s)]
*  Lewiston, it's on the, it was a mill town. Yeah, it used to be, it was a Franco-American town defined [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3561.38s)]
*  by the immigration of French Canadians coming down to work in factories, so it was an urban [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3568.5s)]
*  Franco town. Textiles and paper. Yeah. And biggest mills in New England there, right on the [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3575.06s)]
*  Ander-Scargon River. Working class people, and then an adjacent town, Auburn, frequently referred to [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3580.1s)]
*  as LA, Lewiston-Auburn. It's, you know, I would say it's the second biggest metropolitan area in [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3585.46s)]
*  the state, but now I would say it's a no-go zone. It's not something that people feel safe. You [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3592.26s)]
*  know, the people who supported turning Lewiston into a sanctuary city for Somalis have now spent [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3600.98s)]
*  as much money as they can to get as far away from Lewiston as they can. What was the last time you [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3606.34s)]
*  moved to Lewiston? I have to drive through it frequently for work. How does it look? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3609.38s)]
*  Yeah, third world. I mean, it's not doing great, and there are people who will be [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3616.26s)]
*  you know, partisans for Lewiston, that it's on the verge of a comeback, and you get in trouble if you [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3622.9s)]
*  criticize Lewiston, but we cover police reports, we cover crime reports, we talk to Lewiston police [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3627.38s)]
*  officers. We know what's happening in Lewiston. There are 16 and 17 year olds engaging in gun [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3633.94s)]
*  fights on the streets, and when the police show up to talk to people, nobody will talk. People are [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3639.46s)]
*  getting shot, and nobody will talk. People who get shot won't talk about who shot them. So the [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3646.1800000000003s)]
*  police are frustrated, and they're all just, you know, looking at the clock and wondering when they [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3651.78s)]
*  can start collecting their pension. But it's just a symptom of the law enforcement is just retreating [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3656.1800000000003s)]
*  across the board, whether it's the crime that's happening, the drug crime that was happening in [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3665.46s)]
*  Portland, when they're basically allowing open opioid use and not arresting people, including [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3670.7400000000002s)]
*  people who are selling narcotics, whether it's the gun crime in Lewiston or the Chinese organized [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3677.14s)]
*  crime, all of this, there's just law enforcement have pulled back. What's so scary to me is that [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3682.98s)]
*  Maine is now considered a blue state. A lot of the state is not blue at all, is not in favor of [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3691.94s)]
*  this. It's the southern parts of the state, the coastal parts of the state, the first district [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3698.02s)]
*  that has been completely changed demographically, and now is, you know, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3702.7400000000002s)]
*  totally in the hands of the Democratic Party. But what's interesting is the Republican candidates [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3710.26s)]
*  in Maine, the ones who are lining up to run for governor, for example, in this coming election, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3716.82s)]
*  none of them, from what I can tell, have even mentioned demographic change, crime, and drugs. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3723.94s)]
*  Those are not issues that Republicans want to talk about, even though they are the issues. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3728.58s)]
*  They're the only issues. I think drugs, that I've seen a lot of them have talked about drugs, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3732.58s)]
*  but there's a lot of focus on the cultural war issues, you know, trans athletes, you know, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3738.74s)]
*  the governor is very focused on making sure that boys can participate in girls sports and dominate [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3745.62s)]
*  girls sports. But again, this isn't an issue. I'm against that. Okay, obviously, I think it's, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3750.18s)]
*  you know, it's a humiliation ritual, like so many of these things. However, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3754.02s)]
*  is that what destroyed Lewiston? No, that's exactly that's not that's not the big issue. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3758.2599999999998s)]
*  Right. So how many Republicans are willing to say like, Hey, how about no more Somalis in our state? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3762.66s)]
*  Like, no one voted for that? Why? What do you do? Why are you doing that? By the way, there are no [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3767.54s)]
*  jobs here. So like, why are you bringing poor people into a place with no jobs? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3771.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. That is a fringe radical opinion. That there is again, there is a tremendous fear of [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3774.42s)]
*  being socially ostracized. I think what happened, these people, I mean, I think you kind of [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3781.7799999999997s)]
*  popularize the term gay race communists. I stole it from someone else, but I do. Well, okay. Well, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3788.2599999999998s)]
*  I love it too. I think that the gay race communists increased the social costs of participating in [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3793.54s)]
*  the public sphere during COVID helped by COVID to such a significant degree that good conservative [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3800.18s)]
*  people who might not be explicitly political, but who just are conservative, inclined, they have a [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3807.3s)]
*  conservative disposition withdrew from politics. Because if you went to a school board, you went [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3813.86s)]
*  to a town council meeting and you spoke out, spoke your mind about what you wanted to see happen in [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3819.0600000000004s)]
*  your community. It wasn't just that you disagreed with somebody was that what you were a bad person. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3822.9s)]
*  And if you owned a business, well, there's gonna be a Facebook mob that was going to go give you [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3827.3s)]
*  a one star reviews and you were a bad person. We're going to drive you into the ground. If you [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3830.7400000000002s)]
*  don't want porn books with cartoon blowjobs in them in your kindergarten classroom, if you don't [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3834.02s)]
*  want that, you're a bad person. And so conservatives just said, you know what? Screw it. It's not worth [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3840.98s)]
*  my time. The cost is too high. I'm just going to go take care of my family and my church. I'm going [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3845.78s)]
*  to go fishing. I'm going to hang out with my rotary club. We ceded the public square to the gay race [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3849.14s)]
*  communists and they took over with zeal. I think that's a really crisp and accurate analysis, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3855.38s)]
*  but there's also the problem of how the state of Maine's government acted. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3863.38s)]
*  Right. So I have a friend, lifelong friend here who got into an argument with the state about [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3868.98s)]
*  COVID regulations. He had a restaurant and he came on my show on Fox and mentioned Janet Mills [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3876.9s)]
*  and she and the other women who run the state. I think the state is run entirely by women, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3885.62s)]
*  pretty much. It's a matriarchy. Almost every single official in the state is a left-wing woman, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3888.98s)]
*  angry left-wing white woman, some angry left-wing Somali woman. And gay white men from Portland. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3894.9s)]
*  And gay white men, same thing. The rainbow bullies. Yeah. They descended on him and drove him out of [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3899.38s)]
*  the state. They sent inspectors armed to shut down his business for criticizing her. And he's now [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3906.02s)]
*  operating a business in another state. He's been here his whole life, multi-generational. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3913.06s)]
*  So people are afraid of the state government under Janet Mills. Do you think that? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3917.8599999999997s)]
*  It's the biggest problem in our state. I mean, there is a... [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3923.46s)]
*  But it seems like, Janet Mills seems like a criminal. The state seems to be run like [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3926.9s)]
*  a criminal enterprise. That's my view. Every MaineWire reporter gets the spiel, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3931.54s)]
*  forget what you learned in civics class, we're reporting on a criminal organization. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3937.62s)]
*  They steal from people and then they hand out money to their friends and to a dependent class [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3941.94s)]
*  in order to buy votes. That's how you approach reporting on state government in Maine if you're [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3946.66s)]
*  a reporter from the MaineWire. How many reporters do you have working for you? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3951.2999999999997s)]
*  We have eight, we have nine full-time employees, including myself at this point. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3955.94s)]
*  So I'm not overstating it because probably unlike a lot of people watching this, I actually follow [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3960.74s)]
*  news from the state. I'm interested and I'm horrified. You really are the only organization [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3964.8199999999997s)]
*  covering... So you came from talk radio where you're giving opinions. Now you're really just [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3971.62s)]
*  pretty straight news reporter. Like, here are the facts that we found, we got in the truck, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3978.18s)]
*  we drove around, here's what we saw. I'm an opinionated guy. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3981.06s)]
*  I'm 100% but you're bringing new facts to the table. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3984.18s)]
*  I try to do the investigative journalism, but I also just try to be honest about my opinions about [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3987.7s)]
*  it. I try to be, yes, I'm conservative. Yes, I think it's a bad thing that Chinese criminal [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3992.2599999999998s)]
*  organizations have taken over my state. Yes, I think that's a bad thing, but I'm also going [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=3999.2999999999997s)]
*  to be able to report facts objectively. So how hard is it to hire reporters? Where [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4002.98s)]
*  do you get your reporters? Could you be bigger? I mean, why wouldn't you have a [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4008.18s)]
*  hundred reporters working for you? Could you do that? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4012.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if we had the resources and could find the people, I could keep a team of [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4015.54s)]
*  15, 20 reporters busy around the clock, full-time and pursuing stories. The list of [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4022.66s)]
*  investigative stories that we have to work on that are maybe not the same size and scope as [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4028.58s)]
*  Triad Weed is long, but there's so much organized crime and it's so overlapped with government. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4034.5s)]
*  Virtually every government program is being taken advantage of. The government itself is handing [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4046.98s)]
*  out no-bid contracts in a way that's hard to separate from organized crime. Yeah, I mean, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4052.26s)]
*  it's been very difficult to find people to move to Maine. I had really a heartbreaking moment [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4061.3s)]
*  hiring my most recent producer to do our own podcast and substack project. I'm talking with [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4066.5s)]
*  him. We grew up in Bangor, did everything right, went to high school, stayed out of trouble, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4073.46s)]
*  went to Hassan, got a degree in film production and is getting ready to propose to his girlfriend [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4077.3s)]
*  they've already proposed, so I'm not spilling the beans here. I said, so what's keeping you in Maine? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4086.5800000000004s)]
*  He said, we just haven't been able to save up enough money to get out. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4093.2200000000003s)]
*  That was like a fucking dagger in my heart. Imagine that. Just haven't been able to save [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4099.860000000001s)]
*  up enough money to escape Maine. It's like, where do you escape to even? I guess Texas, Florida, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4106.42s)]
*  Tennessee, some red states, some free states maybe you can get to, but hearing that from him was like, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4114.9800000000005s)]
*  man, so I think that's part of it. I would like Maine to be a place where people want to live, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4122.02s)]
*  but right now it's not. It's very hard to hire people who want to come here. It's like a [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4129.06s)]
*  deployment to a war zone. One of my reporters lives in Portland. I gave him a gun when I hired [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4134.5s)]
*  him and he said he was going to be living in Portland. All legally transferred by the way. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4141.06s)]
*  Yeah, whatever. I mean, when your government is committing crimes like this, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4147.78s)]
*  it's hard to take seriously their laws, which is part of the problem. Everything degrades. It's [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4153.7s)]
*  like, really, you're totally corrupt. You're allowing Chinese drug cartels to control my state [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4157.54s)]
*  and you're worried about whether I have the right license to carry a firearm up yours. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4161.54s)]
*  Pete Slauson But that phenomenon, by the way, has trickled down into all of the legal marijuana [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4165.22s)]
*  businesses who invested in some cases their life savings to build a business, do it legally, do [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4171.06s)]
*  things the right way. Now they're seeing that the laws are being enforced only against white people. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4176.42s)]
*  The marijuana laws are only being enforced against white people. So increasingly, you're [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4182.74s)]
*  seeing more people adopt the same tactics that the Chinese mafia is. Shipping out of state, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4187.94s)]
*  growing more than their licenses allow, cutting corners. There's a pretty famous case, a guy named [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4195.62s)]
*  Lucas Soroes in Farmington, Maine, who was, he set up a business called the Shoe Factory, which was [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4202.339999999999s)]
*  in an old shoe factory building where he built these rooms and people who wanted to grow marijuana [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4210.74s)]
*  could rent from him and they would grow their marijuana at this property and he got reported [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4215.7s)]
*  to the Office of Cannabis Policy and the Office of Cannabis Policy immediately referred him to the [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4221.54s)]
*  Drug Enforcement Agency, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency and the DOJ got on top of him [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4227.54s)]
*  and they wiretapped his phones, recorded his conversations with his father and are still, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4234.5s)]
*  to this day, pursuing a case to try to send him to prison for doing a smaller scale version of what [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4240.34s)]
*  they knew. They knew and I can prove that they knew because there's public documents and documents [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4248.42s)]
*  I've obtained through Freedom of Access Act requests, what they knew the Chinese organizations [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4254.74s)]
*  were doing at the same time, including at that facility in Turner where William Robinson was [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4258.82s)]
*  shot in the head in December. So they are, if you've got a French Canadian last name, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4264.9s)]
*  they're going to stick the DOJ after you. They're going to try to lock you in a cage, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4270.9s)]
*  but if your last name is Wu or Huang or Chen, you don't get the laws applied to you. You get arrested, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4275.299999999999s)]
*  you get $500 bail, maybe $10,000 or $20,000 if it's Somerset County, and then who knows if you show [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4283.78s)]
*  up at your trial or a few sentences. You're making me really radical. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4290.9s)]
*  To the governor's brother who's profiting, who has provably profited from this, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4296.82s)]
*  is anybody in main state media mentioning this? Is anyone following up on this? The governor's [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4303.94s)]
*  never responded to this. It's just like you report this and then it just disappears. National media [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4310.5s)]
*  reported on it. Yeah, I mean, plenty. I mean, they've got plenty of attention in the national media. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4314.82s)]
*  I've done a segment with CBS to their credit. Peter Schweitzer, who's a great author journalist [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4320.02s)]
*  who's spent a lot of time working on the China topic and the drug topic, helped me get in touch [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4329.7s)]
*  with CBS and they came up and did a segment on it. NBC later ripped off that segment and basically [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4335.38s)]
*  plagiarized all of my journalism, but that's fine. It's gotten national attention, but not the Paul [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4341.7s)]
*  Mills part of it. The local newspaper reporters don't seem to be interested in it. It's weird. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4346.26s)]
*  I've been accused of xenophobia for reporting on this huge criminal organization that took over my [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4356.1s)]
*  state and that's ruining all of these buildings. That's one thing. What do you do with that? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4364.26s)]
*  Oh, it's just idiots online, progressives, elected officials. The only time I've ever [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4368.02s)]
*  testified on a bill was when there was a lawmaker who introduced a bill that would have [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4375.14s)]
*  given Maine a little RICO statute to help crack down on organized crime operations like this. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4381.3s)]
*  I figured I'd testify because I've seen more of these than anybody in the state. At this point, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4387.700000000001s)]
*  I could be a self-anointed expert witness in Chinese marijuana. I've got a degree in Chinese [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4392.660000000001s)]
*  marijuana. I testified neither for or against this bill and just was there to answer questions about [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4396.9800000000005s)]
*  how this operates. As we included the clip in our documentary, they didn't want to hear. They shut [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4403.14s)]
*  down my testimony and said, can we hear from an actual expert about this? They pushed me out and [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4410.18s)]
*  they voted down the bill, voted against the only piece of legislation that would have empowered law [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4415.46s)]
*  enforcement to do anything about this. They've reacted very negatively and hostilely to my attempts [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4421.7s)]
*  to just show them what's happening in the state. I think we've gone above and beyond in terms of [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4429.3s)]
*  the evidence that we've provided, the documentation that we've provided, because we know that [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4437.54s)]
*  not being an established, being independent media, being conservative media, there's going to be a [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4443.06s)]
*  higher standard of proof that we have to meet. I think that we've met it and gone way beyond it [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4448.5s)]
*  over and over and over and over and over again. Still, they will not acknowledge it. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4454.1s)]
*  Specifically, when it comes to Palm Hills, who his clients are involved in more marijuana grows than [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4460.58s)]
*  the one we've reported on. There's a building in Sangerville, Maine right now. It's the biggest [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4467.700000000001s)]
*  building in Sangerville. It started construction in August of last year. It's just now finished [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4471.9400000000005s)]
*  and it's coming online. It's going to be a big, big, productive marijuana grow owned by [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4477.46s)]
*  the client that Paul Mills transferred the property in Cronutoo. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4484.1s)]
*  So, the point of Maine is its majestic nature. The governor, Janet Mills, who really can't overstage, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4490.820000000001s)]
*  really, it's shocking the more you know about Janet Mills, but they have bulldozed, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4501.46s)]
*  chainsawed, flattened, clear cut forests in Maine for solar panels because that's like [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4505.700000000001s)]
*  environmentally positive or something. I mean, it's like strange. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4511.86s)]
*  It's part of the criminal organization. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4515.219999999999s)]
*  It is and they hate nature. They hate nature amazingly. What's the environmental impact of [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4517.299999999999s)]
*  these grows? Every single house that has had one of these Chinese marijuana grows, the best use for [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4523.46s)]
*  it is potentially practice for the fire department. They all need to be torn down. They're super sites, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4531.0599999999995s)]
*  super fun sites. We don't even know the extent of the damage that's been done as a result of [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4537.3s)]
*  the Chinese pesticides and fungicides that have been imported from China illegally into California [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4543.62s)]
*  and then shipped to Maine and used at these sites as fume against. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4550.58s)]
*  Actually? [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4554.18s)]
*  Yes. California has a really bad problem with this. In the Siskiyou National Forest, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4554.900000000001s)]
*  they have what they call hoop houses, massive greenhouses. They are operated by Chinese [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4562.34s)]
*  criminal organizations there, often in concert with the Central American cartels. They've been [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4568.02s)]
*  investigating these from an environmental perspective because they've weakened their [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4574.5s)]
*  drug laws so much that no one cares about illegal marijuana, but they do care about water diversion [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4578.74s)]
*  to supply the cannabis and they care about the contamination of these pristine wildlife [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4583.46s)]
*  environments with the chemical runoff. So they have the environment police out there working [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4589.78s)]
*  to fight the Chinese mafia. They've found pesticides, fungicides, fume against in Chinese labeled [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4595.139999999999s)]
*  Mylar bags and they found some shipping labels that they were able to trace back to a property [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4603.94s)]
*  in California, which they obtained a postal warrant on and found that this particular house [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4610.74s)]
*  was also shipping to a grow supply store in Massachusetts and a house in Monmouth, Maine, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4616.98s)]
*  which is in Kennebec County, maybe 20 miles away from Augusta, the state's capital. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4623.379999999999s)]
*  It's on Academy Road, it's about maybe a thousand feet from a school. We went to the house and [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4630.259999999999s)]
*  knocked on the door to try to see if the owner wanted to talk. No one was there. It very clearly [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4637.0599999999995s)]
*  had been turned into a marijuana grow at one point, but was not active. And we went and talked [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4643.06s)]
*  with the neighbor who was a firefighter and he says, Oh no, it's active. There's people there [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4647.780000000001s)]
*  in the mornings around two o'clock in the morning to five o'clock in the morning and there's activity [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4652.42s)]
*  there. So we kind of drew the conclusion that potentially this was a shipping hub or receiving [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4656.580000000001s)]
*  hub for these pesticides and fume against and chemicals that were being sent, imported from [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4662.5s)]
*  China to California and distributed to Chinese marijuana. And they're not legal here because [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4667.700000000001s)]
*  they're poison. There's no licensed regulated use for many of these pesticides and fungicides. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4672.42s)]
*  Because they're so deadly for humans, but it's even worse than that. So they're using chemicals [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4684.02s)]
*  that are not licensed for use in the United States and are deadly. Sometimes some of them aren't even [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4694.02s)]
*  licensed for use in China, which is not notorious for their concern for environmental rights, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4700.9s)]
*  human rights, environmental degradation. But they're also not very well studied, used together [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4706.0199999999995s)]
*  in like eight of them together, 12 of them together. They're not studied when you burn them. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4714.099999999999s)]
*  They're not studied when you apply them to marijuana and eat the marijuana. They're not studied [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4718.82s)]
*  when you apply them to marijuana and smoke the marijuana. They're not studied when you use them [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4722.42s)]
*  in all these different combinations and then do a gas extraction process to extract the THC oil [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4726.1s)]
*  and a more potent version of this pesticide fume again. They're not studied at all. They were [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4731.780000000001s)]
*  unknown. They only identified a lot of these chemicals. They only identified a lot of these [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4736.18s)]
*  chemicals in California because they brought in the weapons of mass destruction unit from the Army [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4742.9800000000005s)]
*  National Guard because the conventional labs couldn't test for them. And there's no lab in [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4748.900000000001s)]
*  the state of Maine that can test for them that I know of. None of the cannabis labs can take [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4753.22s)]
*  cannabis grown at a Chinese marijuana grow that has used these pesticides and test it and determine [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4757.780000000001s)]
*  that it's contaminated. They may be now because I've shared the information with them directly [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4763.860000000001s)]
*  from the chemists in California who are identifying them and trying to lead the fight against them. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4768.820000000001s)]
*  They may be able to test for them now, but the consequence of it is that you could take a bit [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4774.740000000001s)]
*  of marijuana from one of these grows that's been treated with these heinous, deadly chemicals and [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4779.78s)]
*  test it at one of the labs and get an A plus. Test it approved. No bad chemicals. This is safe [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4786.5s)]
*  for consumption. Because you're not capable of testing these chemicals. Yeah, because it's [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4792.98s)]
*  just a different process. It's not like you put a sample of cannabis in a machine and it says, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4796.58s)]
*  here's everything that's in it. There's each different pesticide or bacterium or arsenic. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4802.34s)]
*  There's different processes to test what's in these. And people are putting this in their bodies? [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4807.7s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they don't know. They don't know. So these Mylar bags, well, first of all, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4812.5s)]
*  the house where we knew these products were being shipped, we knock on the door [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4818.34s)]
*  and do a story about it. And a week later, the house hits the market for sale. Not suspicious [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4822.34s)]
*  at all. And the following week, I get a call from a grandmother who had just taken a tour of the [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4828.66s)]
*  house as a prospective buyer with her two grandchildren. And she was calling me because [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4835.22s)]
*  she and her grandchildren immediately developed respiratory symptoms after walking through the [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4841.46s)]
*  house. And they were concerned enough that they Googled it and they found my article and they [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4845.62s)]
*  called me and they wanted to know, what do we do? We've just been exposed to dangerous, unknown [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4849.9400000000005s)]
*  Chinese neurotoxins. What do we do? Like, fuck the final, man. I'm just a journalist. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4857.46s)]
*  So Janet Mills is the steward of the environment, the big environmentalist governor. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4863.3s)]
*  Sure. Sure. Yeah. I mean, she's supported by the Natural Resources Council of Maine and the [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4868.34s)]
*  Maine Renewable Energy Association and all the other corrupt trade groups that turn out in profit [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4875.22s)]
*  from the sale of solar panels made by Chinese slaves in Western China. Yeah, sure. She would [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4880.580000000001s)]
*  position herself that way and presumably future Democrats will position themselves that way. But [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4885.860000000001s)]
*  these same Mylar bags, by the way, that we've seen in California that we've identified, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4891.86s)]
*  we know to a certain extent what these chemicals are thanks to the Weapons of Mass Destruction Lab. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4896.18s)]
*  The most recent bust in Somerset County by Sheriff Dale Lancaster, he photographs that he distributed [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4901.14s)]
*  with his press release the same exact bags. They're coming here from California, shipped here [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4907.14s)]
*  illegally from China being distributed here. And if they're in that one grow in Somerset County, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4913.3s)]
*  you can assume that they're in all of these grows and they dump mad science concoctions of [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4918.1s)]
*  pesticides with sawdust and ammonium nitrate and a little fuse and a half cup beer can. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4923.14s)]
*  And they let it smolder and the smoke fills the house and it covers the marijuana plants. And so [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4928.58s)]
*  the mites won't grow and the mildew won't grow. So you have minimal product loss. Are you serious? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4933.54s)]
*  It's very effective at mitigating any kind of pesticide or pest damage to your marijuana product. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4938.58s)]
*  But it coats every corner of the house and these dangerous chemicals. So we have no way of testing [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4944.900000000001s)]
*  for them. There's no real estate disclosure. There are houses right now for sale by the same real [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4952.02s)]
*  estate agent who tried to sell this fucking house to the grandmother I talked with. There are houses [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4957.14s)]
*  that are for sale right now on the market that have very likely been contaminated with these [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4962.900000000001s)]
*  pesticides or at a minimum the black mold that comes with a house that's kept at 99% humidity [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4967.700000000001s)]
*  and 80 degrees so that marijuana can grow. They're on the market right now being sold [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4973.62s)]
*  with no disclosure whatsoever. And this is a state with one of the most profound housing crises in [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4978.18s)]
*  the country because of immigration and Airbnb and big companies buying up residential real estate [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4982.099999999999s)]
*  like people can't afford houses here period. Yeah also just assholes from Massachusetts and [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4989.86s)]
*  New York moving here. Well I didn't want to say that but yeah. It's true. I'll just say for the [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=4993.86s)]
*  record if we're talking about mass deportation like the Massachusetts and New York. Mass deportation. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5000.98s)]
*  Yeah I get it. I've got some dirty jokes on that subject but I'm not going to share them. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5008.339999999999s)]
*  So it's reducing the amount of available housing for main people. It is poisoning the state's [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5016.419999999999s)]
*  environment which the government claims to be a steward of and they know it's happening [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5023.0599999999995s)]
*  right? I just want to be totally clear on. You're a journalist working with other journalists [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5030.5s)]
*  trying to expose the scale of this disaster, this crime but it's not like government officials don't [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5036.9s)]
*  know. I'm going to talk about the governor. Like people who run the town managers in all these [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5044.34s)]
*  little towns, the selectmen in all these little towns, they've got to know too right? Yeah I would [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5049.62s)]
*  assume. I mean I know that the Lincoln County Sheriff has videotaped surveillance evidence of [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5053.78s)]
*  illegal dumping going on out behind these sites. There's at Machias out in Washington County at a [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5060.66s)]
*  marijuana grow I visited there. You could almost study the ages of marijuana cultivation there by [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5067.62s)]
*  looking at the strata of the styrofoam or I guess fiberglass substrate that they start the marijuana [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5074.179999999999s)]
*  plants in because they were just layers and layers and layers and layers where they'd been [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5082.42s)]
*  growing marijuana because they just take it when they're done with it they throw it out in the [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5087.06s)]
*  backyard and so just the entire property is a beautiful farm in Machias that overlooks the [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5091.46s)]
*  water just like could be someone's paradise and the soil will be permanently contaminated with [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5098.9800000000005s)]
*  god knows what chemicals and fiberglass. It's everywhere distributed throughout the property. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5105.86s)]
*  Every single one of these places has like an unknown level of contamination, water [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5110.42s)]
*  contamination, soil contamination, the danger to people. The processes that are used to extract [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5116.74s)]
*  the THC and the CBD, the psychoactive useful chemicals in marijuana, these same processes [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5124.58s)]
*  also can collect the oil soluble pesticides and fungicides in higher concentrations. So when you [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5131.9400000000005s)]
*  concentrate the vape pen to 99% THC you're also concentrating some of these pesticides and [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5139.14s)]
*  fungicides and then those are being sold. I mean from the Chinese grows to two-thirds of them are [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5147.0599999999995s)]
*  leaving the state. They're being sold in New York, Massachusetts, the southeast United States, all [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5151.54s)]
*  over the place. People are unknowingly consuming these substances that have just not been studied [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5156.0199999999995s)]
*  at all. So we wouldn't even really know if somebody was experiencing side effects of [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5161.46s)]
*  unintentional exposure to some of these carbonate poisons. I mean there's so much that we don't know [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5167.46s)]
*  about the dangers of these chemicals and you can't help but wonder if that's intentional. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5175.38s)]
*  Pete Slauson Of course it's intentional. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5182.26s)]
*  Jared Slauson I've read Unrestricted Warfare. They explicitly [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5183.94s)]
*  contemplate environmental destruction and unrestricted warfare. The book written by Chinese [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5188.66s)]
*  colonels in 1999, which basically laid out exactly what they would do to us over the next 25 years. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5194.42s)]
*  And we know thanks to Philip Linzicki from the Daily Caller News Foundation who reported [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5201.62s)]
*  just last week that there was reporting we did in Dexter, my hometown, about a mile [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5206.58s)]
*  from where I grew up, at an illegal marijuana row. We found an abandoned BMW there and there [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5213.46s)]
*  were two shirts over the driver's seat and the passenger's seat that had Chinese writing on them [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5220.66s)]
*  for the Shih Tzu Association of New York. I was like, huh, that's weird. Took some pictures of [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5227.3s)]
*  it, didn't really think anything of it. This place, by the way, is like a mile from a military [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5232.5s)]
*  facility, US Army Reserve Garrison. And later, Philip was able to connect the dots between two [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5238.74s)]
*  individuals arrested in Carmel, Maine. One of them was Weizan Huang and a film from a Chinese [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5246.98s)]
*  Communist Party event in New York where two of these individuals who were arrested, they're mug [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5256.099999999999s)]
*  shots, they're on video at this event. And then Weizan Huang is featured, while he's out on bail, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5260.82s)]
*  by the way, is featured in Chinese state-run media back in his hometown doing classic United [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5266.339999999999s)]
*  front work, talking about how he's going to come back to the United States and he's going to bring [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5273.0599999999995s)]
*  home the bacon for his hometown, bring home American investment for his people. And he is [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5276.42s)]
*  the executive director of the association that those shirts were linked to. So thanks to, I guess, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5282.02s)]
*  the work we did on the ground and Philip's advanced knowledge of Cantonese Mandarin, the culture, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5289.62s)]
*  the language, and how these Chinese benevolent associations work. They're all front groups, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5295.06s)]
*  by the way. The Chinese consulate in New York should be gone. It should not be allowed to be [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5299.14s)]
*  operating in the United States. The president of the United States should close it down immediately, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5303.78s)]
*  all those Chinese consulates. They're military bases from a hostile foreign power. They should [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5308.0199999999995s)]
*  be gone and New York should not be allowed to issue licenses to foreign nationals because it's [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5312.58s)]
*  hurting every other state. But thanks to- Drivers licenses. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5318.259999999999s)]
*  Drivers licenses, their identity documents, the state of New York is printing false identity [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5322.099999999999s)]
*  documents for criminal organizations, aiding and abetting them. They're all coming here with [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5327.38s)]
*  drivers licenses from New York. And a month later, they get a license to grow marijuana here in the [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5331.3s)]
*  state of Maine, and it's a mess. But we're spending our time arguing about Israel and Iran and all the [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5336.02s)]
*  rest when the country's dying. It's the amount of energy that's being expended on things that don't [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5340.9800000000005s)]
*  really matter that much to the exclusion of things that really do matter, life and death questions, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5346.66s)]
*  like the ones you're describing, is really upsetting. And Iranians never come taking a [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5350.58s)]
*  shit in my hometown like the Chinese communists are. Nobody from my high school class has died [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5356.58s)]
*  from Iranian fentanyl. I guess if we take out their nuclear program, are we committing ourselves to a [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5363.86s)]
*  permanent technological subjugation of the Iranians forever? Are we gonna forever, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5373.22s)]
*  are we gonna 100, 1000 years from now gonna be keeping them no nuclear weapons? Is that [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5378.18s)]
*  what we're gonna do? Because they're gonna be pretty pissed off if you go take them out now. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5382.74s)]
*  Is that the position? Not to stray outside of my lane of expertise. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5386.82s)]
*  I don't think that anybody advocating for this cares, because they don't care about the country [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5390.42s)]
*  in the first place. Yeah, well, war is profitable. I wish that it was as profitable, like, how do you [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5395.54s)]
*  make it profitable to just enforce the laws that we already have here in the state of Maine? Like, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5402.0199999999995s)]
*  how do you just enforce the laws against people who are engaging in tax evasion? They're breaking [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5408.74s)]
*  the marijuana laws, they're breaking the environmental laws. In some cases, they're [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5413.7s)]
*  jumping their meter to steal electricity. There's not one Indian-owned convenience store that I've [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5417.22s)]
*  ever been to in Maine that's following tax laws. I mean, that's just a fact. Why aren't they being [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5423.54s)]
*  audited? We have the Maine revenue services, you know, they should be following up on that. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5428.9s)]
*  Yeah. So here's my question. You were speaking earlier about the unequal application of the law [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5432.42s)]
*  in the state along racial lines. So these grows are just proceeding unimpeded. There's no real [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5439.06s)]
*  penalty. People are dying, nobody cares. State's being poisoned, nobody cares. Jen and Mizzle's [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5446.1s)]
*  brother's making money from it. It's great. Media won't report on it. What would happen to you if [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5450.34s)]
*  you torched one of these places? Like, it's in your town, it's next to your house, there's a grow, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5454.580000000001s)]
*  you burn it down, no one's hurt, but you eliminate that problem from your town. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5459.780000000001s)]
*  What would happen to you if you did that? I would have a very good alibi. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5465.38s)]
*  And I want to say, I'm not even going to bother to save the record. I'm not encouraging that. It's [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5475.22s)]
*  not up to me. So I'm not getting involved in what people would do or not. One of them burned down, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5478.42s)]
*  by the way, just last Friday. Yeah. And Wilton. Yeah. A big one. A big one. And I was inside it. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5482.1s)]
*  And after it burned? Yeah, after it burned. I have an alibi for the time. Wait, let me finish [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5488.9s)]
*  my question. I'm just saying, anytime something happens to one of these, I have an alibi. I don't [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5495.219999999999s)]
*  know what it is yet. You're out of state. I was with Tucker. But if you're caught doing that, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5500.42s)]
*  I guess let me just say, you're busted by the police, the same police who didn't bust the Chinese [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5507.7s)]
*  drug cartel that was running the place, what would happen to you? I think I would go to jail [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5511.94s)]
*  for a very long time and probably under hate crime statutes, my jail sentence would be increased. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5515.86s)]
*  It would be a racist act of violence against a marginalized community. Marginalized community [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5523.7s)]
*  being the Chinese drug cartel. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's what I think would happen. How long's [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5532.179999999999s)]
*  your family been in Maine? Six, seven generations. I mean, since it was in Massachusetts, I mean, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5537.219999999999s)]
*  it was 1820, 200 years ago. Yeah. I mean, it's as far back as we care to look at that stuff. I don't [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5545.54s)]
*  know. One of my grandfather's, my grandfather's father was adopted. So there's some empty spaces [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5552.1s)]
*  there. So we don't know. But I mean, as far back as we've been able to research. So a foreign drug [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5560.5s)]
*  cartel can come to your town, destroy the town, commit crimes in plain sight. There's nothing [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5566.1s)]
*  anybody can do about it. But if having watched the total collapse of law enforcement, you decide [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5571.38s)]
*  to enforce the law informally by getting rid of the drug house, not hurting anyone, but just [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5577.22s)]
*  destroying the property, you go to jail. Yeah. That's tyranny, right? Or what would happen if [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5581.7s)]
*  I went to China and decided, hey, I'm going to go grow a bunch of pot and sell it illegally all [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5590.74s)]
*  around. Oh, and it's going to be poisoned too with poisons that I've illegally shipped in from [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5595.06s)]
*  the United States. Not saying we want to become any more like China, but the unequal application [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5600.5s)]
*  of the laws is so obvious that it is going to encourage this, what you're talking about, [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5607.46s)]
*  vigilantism. Because marijuana in Maine is such a huge business. We're known for lobsters, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5613.38s)]
*  blueberries, whatever. But if you look at it in terms of economic value, and if you add the gray [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5619.86s)]
*  market and the black market to what's actually being taxed, it's way bigger than blueberries, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5624.66s)]
*  lobster and potatoes combined in terms of its economic value for the state. And there are a lot [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5630.26s)]
*  of people who spend a considerable amount of their time, energy and treasure trying to build [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5635.54s)]
*  businesses around this, following the rules, doing the right thing, trying to follow these weird, [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5641.7s)]
*  murky, hard to follow regulations that change all the time. And the regulators are punitive. And if [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5646.42s)]
*  you complain about them on Instagram, they're going to give you a surprise inspection and write [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5652.1s)]
*  you a ticket, only if you're white. And all of these business owners are being put under because [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5655.860000000001s)]
*  of the unequal enforcement of the laws. Because the dumping of the Chinese grown marijuana, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5664.02s)]
*  which comes with all these built in cost advantages, you don't have to pay your laborers, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5670.1s)]
*  you can steal electricity, you can use pesticides and fungicides, you can grow way over the plant [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5674.58s)]
*  limits, you have no regulatory compliance costs. So you can go sell your product for half what the [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5678.74s)]
*  legal main business owners can sell. So they're going bankrupt, and they're looking at a government [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5683.94s)]
*  that's not enforcing the laws equally. And if you don't think that they're contemplating [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5690.34s)]
*  vigilantism, you're crazy. They absolutely are. They absolutely are. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5694.82s)]
*  Why wouldn't they just pay off Chanot Mills' brother even more than the [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5698.98s)]
*  Chinese drug cartels are paying him? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5702.58s)]

*  considered it. I don't know if she's open to bribes from the other side. I do know that [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5709.620000000001s)]

*  The highest ranking official for the Chinese consulate in New York was at her inauguration. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5726.660000000001s)]

*  be doing at Chanot Mills' inauguration as governor of Maine? That doesn't make any sense at all. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5738.900000000001s)]
*  According to Chinese state-run media, taking meetings with Senate President Troy Jackson, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5744.02s)]

*  How's that gone, by the way? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5760.18s)]
*  Objectively, I think that we have yet to devise a measure of political science or social science [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5763.14s)]
*  by which you could say the state has improved under Chanot Mills. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5769.9400000000005s)]
*  If they found one, I can't tell you. Nothing's gotten better. I think that the best example of [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5774.18s)]
*  the people of Maine lacking the immune system to repel something like this is Woodville, Maine, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5784.02s)]
*  which is a town of maybe 300, 350 people. It's Penobscot County, northern Penobscot County, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5790.34s)]
*  maybe 45 minutes to an hour north of Bangor. Pretty town. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5798.02s)]
*  Pretty, very rural. Really just like one road going through it and a lot of dirt roads. They've [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5802.42s)]
*  got a three-person selectman, Manfred's the chief selectman, great guy, no-nonsense man, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5808.74s)]
*  you'd love him, he'd fit in around here. They had an obnoxious Chinese marijuana grow right [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5814.34s)]
*  next to their town office. Right next to their town office. You could smell it. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5820.820000000001s)]

*  This used to be a lumber mill or a sawmill. It was like the days mill back in a former Maine. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5835.38s)]
*  It was a prosperous business that made lumber and wood for people to build homes so that middle [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5843.62s)]
*  class families could live in them instead of growing marijuana in them. This place was [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5848.26s)]
*  obnoxious. There was effluent always running across the road. The people were angry and mean [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5853.22s)]
*  and nasty and they wouldn't pay their taxes. Then someone would show up from New York and [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5859.3s)]
*  just slap $100 bills on the counter until the clerk said, okay, the taxes are paid and then [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5864.099999999999s)]
*  leave. At one point they had to call the animal control officer because there was a Cantonese [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5870.82s)]
*  speaking individual out in the front yard beating a border collie with a stick. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5877.7s)]

*  You'd have to ask Manfred. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5893.139999999999s)]
*  Look, I don't want to be judgmental, but you can't. That crosses so many lines. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5895.7s)]

*  They took the dog away. The dog was clearly very severely abused. When the animal control [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5904.66s)]
*  officer showed up, the guy just picked up the dog, threw him over and said, take him. No good. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5910.98s)]
*  I could see going into the town council meetings that I could see this happening, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5921.38s)]
*  the lack of an immune system to repel what was happening and cross the line from journalists to [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5927.38s)]
*  like, I don't know, local activists. I was like, why don't you guys just write an ordinance that [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5934.900000000001s)]
*  says that you can declare that an illegal cannabis business and start fining them $10,000 a day until [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5943.06s)]
*  they shut it down. If they don't pay the fine, then you put a lien against the property and turn [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5948.74s)]
*  off the electricity because if they can't have electricity, they can't grow marijuana. If they [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5954.18s)]
*  can't grow marijuana, they can't make money. They will leave. Just write an ordinance and do that. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5958.42s)]
*  They were like, geez, that's not a bad idea. And they wrote the ordinance. They passed the ordinance. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5962.42s)]
*  And 30 days later, I reached out and they were like, well, how do we enforce the ordinance? [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5969.46s)]
*  Well, get your court enforcement officer, as the ordinance says, get your court enforcement officer [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5975.780000000001s)]
*  to go declare it from an exterior inspection and illegal cannabis business and start issuing the [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5979.14s)]
*  fines. And I'm like, well, geez, I don't know if our code enforcement officer will do that. She's [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5984.26s)]
*  got a couple of towns she deals with. I don't know. I still don't know what the status of it is, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5990.42s)]
*  but these guys, this particular marijuana grow ended up applying for a license with the Office [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=5995.06s)]
*  of Cannabis Policy to grow legally. And when the inspector showed up, they were already growing [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6000.5s)]
*  hundreds of plants. And they couldn't explain to them that that's illegal and disqualifying for [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6006.1s)]
*  getting a license. But this is like the one place that ended up not getting a legal license after [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6012.660000000001s)]
*  being caught growing marijuana illegally. But it's still owned by Chinese nationals because [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6019.860000000001s)]
*  these are effective real estate investments too. The real estate is an effective way to hide capital [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6026.34s)]
*  from the Chinese government itself. That's happening all over the United States. And it's [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6031.62s)]
*  really affecting residential real estate prices, of course. And it's not just China that's dumping [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6037.3s)]
*  money here as a safe haven and destroying the ability of our kids to buy houses. You said [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6042.34s)]
*  something off camera, which I hope you will elaborate on a little bit. So one of, I think [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6048.66s)]
*  people listening to this who aren't familiar with Northern New England might say, well, wow, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6053.46s)]
*  the people sound pretty passive in the face of the total destruction of their state, their way [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6057.62s)]
*  of life, their culture, their economy, the land itself. How could they put up with that? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6062.9s)]
*  And you said something, oh, I think this is fair. You said, the best part of Maine is that people [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6068.98s)]
*  are instinctively hesitant to bother other people, but that's also a weakness. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6075.94s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you, Mainers don't want people up in their shit so they don't get up in other people's [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6080.9s)]
*  shit. And I'll say that there are, I was more scared knocking on some of the doors that I knew [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6088.179999999999s)]
*  Mainers owned the properties because they might answer with a gun. The Chinese, the individuals [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6098.82s)]
*  who are at these facilities growing marijuana, it's my belief. In most cases, they are victims of [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6105.62s)]
*  exploitation by criminal organizations. They're being paid maybe a thousand dollars a month. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6112.0199999999995s)]
*  They're being exposed to chemicals that they have no idea what the consequences of that will be, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6118.5s)]
*  the mold. They're living in conditions that any American would look at and be like, that's slavery [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6124.26s)]
*  or that's human trafficking. That is unreal. But they could be doing it voluntarily. I still think [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6129.14s)]
*  that they're victims, but they're very servile in most cases when you try to ask them questions [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6134.58s)]
*  or interview them and they can't speak English or they pretend they can't speak English and they call [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6142.1s)]
*  someone in New York and do an interview over the phone and they don't want to answer any questions. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6146.1s)]
*  But they very much, the people who are operating this know about that culture in Maine and they [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6151.22s)]
*  exploit it for a reason. They came to Maine with a playbook that they'd run previously in [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6159.7s)]
*  Washington State, in California, in Oklahoma to camouflage themselves within legal marijuana [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6166.26s)]
*  programs, but they knew that once they got to Maine, there was going to be this live and let [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6171.38s)]
*  live type culture and they took advantage of it. And that's what pisses me off so much. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6175.7s)]
*  The Yankee reserve, it's got the highest incidence of English ancestry of any state, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6179.86s)]
*  is what the world has done to Great Britain in the same dynamic. You come in [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6185.14s)]
*  living off the charity of the people who built the country and then you give them the finger, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6191.46s)]
*  then you destroy what they built, then you take more money from them and they do nothing. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6195.7s)]
*  And the only people who speak up about it get arrested for speaking up about it. Because [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6200.18s)]
*  you're leveraging Anglo-politeness against the Anglos is what you're doing. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6204.58s)]
*  Yeah. And they even have a word for, what is it, like BISO, the white liberals. They're very [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6209.14s)]
*  strategically taking advantage of this hesitant, this deep-seated fear amongst white people in Maine [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6216.02s)]
*  to be labeled as a racist or described as a racist. And there's even this stereotype about this [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6223.22s)]
*  rural redneck and it's true of Maine and it's true of any other state. Yeah, these people are just [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6230.34s)]
*  racist. And I encountered over and over and over again in every county that I went to, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6236.66s)]
*  people who went out of their way to be as fucking nice to these people as they possibly could. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6242.26s)]
*  In Franklin County, there was a guy who plowed them out for like two years because they needed [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6249.139999999999s)]
*  to have the driveway clean. Explain what plow out means. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6256.74s)]
*  Sorry. It snows in Maine for people who are unfamiliar. It snows. The Chinese were apparently [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6260.26s)]
*  unfamiliar with that. So this was one of the challenges they had to surmount as they're trying [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6266.18s)]
*  to make a marijuana pickup. When the U-Haul or the Sprinter van is coming to pick up 500 pounds of [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6271.3s)]
*  marijuana, you can't have two feet of snow in the driveway. So there was actually a marijuana grow [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6276.9800000000005s)]
*  that was on the Department of Homeland Security's list. And this is in Chesterville, Maine. It was, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6282.900000000001s)]
*  I think, 200 West Road. And they needed help plowing. So this Chinese guy walks up the [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6290.9800000000005s)]
*  driveway of their neighbors and holds out a phone. And it's a woman in New York who negotiates an [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6299.700000000001s)]
*  arrangement where they plow the guy out. And so they'd bring their tractor down and plow the [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6303.46s)]
*  driveway. And they did that for them for free. They didn't even negotiate a price. They were [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6308.5s)]
*  just like, yeah, we'll go plow you out. You're our neighbor. They did that for them. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6314.02s)]
*  That's what they're like. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6316.740000000001s)]
*  Because they were just like, it was a guy who- [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6317.3s)]
*  And then returned the Chinese poison their children. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6319.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6323.14s)]
*  Sorry, it's just true. But you've described the way every rural community, probably in the country, [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6323.62s)]
*  but certainly- [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6327.7s)]
*  No, they later abused that relationship to the point where the woman who was living at that [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6328.58s)]
*  property, I think she's in her 60s, a young Chinese man, maybe 20s or 30s, came over and [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6335.54s)]
*  asked the elderly Chinese woman if she would go mow the lawn for them. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6344.42s)]
*  So last question. It doesn't seem like, and you're the expert on politics in the state, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6354.9s)]
*  but it seems like it's pretty hard to make a change. The governor's leaving [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6360.9s)]
*  in the next election. Thank God. However, there are a lot of people like the governor [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6368.02s)]
*  in state government, like the whole state government, not the whole, but a lot of it is [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6372.58s)]
*  truly corrupt. So I don't know. I'm not that confident that anyone in Maine is going to [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6376.74s)]
*  fix Maine's problems. Can the feds do anything? Can the Trump Justice Department [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6382.419999999999s)]
*  begin to fix this problem? [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6387.62s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. And I think that you're seeing glimmers of that. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6389.379999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's fun to fight about the tranny stuff, okay? [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6395.379999999999s)]
*  But if you've got military age, male Chinese in uniform, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6398.74s)]
*  throughout the state, you've got thousands of Chinese here illegally working for drug cartels. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6405.94s)]
*  Like that's a national security threat, no? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6409.94s)]
*  They control the former Maine National Guard base in Gardner. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6411.54s)]
*  What? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6414.66s)]
*  Yeah. It's a former Maine National Guard base. It was decommissioned and sold. It's a big brick [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6415.139999999999s)]
*  military garrison surrounded by barbed wire, but there's an illegal Chinese marijuana grow [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6420.5s)]
*  operating out of that. It's about two miles from the state house. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6425.06s)]
*  Actually? [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6432.02s)]
*  Yeah. And just down the road from there, there's another one that is operating out of an old [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6432.740000000001s)]
*  meat walker. It used to be run by Johnny Wu. Johnny Wu lost his license. Ben Wang came in, [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6438.02s)]
*  and now it's operating under her license. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6443.14s)]
*  Okay. Sorry. We've been talking for almost two hours and every sentence shocks me. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6447.620000000001s)]
*  Okay. I think you've established this is an imminent national security threat. So what [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6455.06s)]
*  could the feds do and why haven't they done anything? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6462.42s)]
*  They need to treat it like a national security threat, first of all. I think that there's [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6464.26s)]
*  maybe an illusion that Maine doesn't have anything that's of vital national security [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6469.780000000001s)]
*  interest, but there are internet lines that run, international internet lines that run through [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6474.5s)]
*  Maine. There's Bath Iron Works, a defense contractor here. There's some military [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6482.1s)]
*  facilities and there's a huge, like a 5,000 acre, I guess a national guard complex in Woodville, [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6487.14s)]
*  the town where the border collie was being beat. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6497.3s)]
*  Well, there are also like training facilities in Maine that are widely known. There's the [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6502.34s)]
*  longest runway, I think, in North America, Bombard Runway in Bangor. There's also an [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6507.3s)]
*  incredibly long international border. Plus it's an American state. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6512.9800000000005s)]
*  So there's one of the oldest American states. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6517.46s)]
*  It needs to be treated like a national security threat and the northern border needs to be treated [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6519.38s)]
*  with the same seriousness that the southern border is, particularly our northeast border. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6524.1s)]
*  Right now we have basically the thin blue line protecting America from illegal aliens from [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6529.7s)]
*  Jordan or from Algeria or from China from sneaking across the Maine border are like [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6538.66s)]
*  19 and 20 year old cops from Fort Fairfield, Maine, happening to pull somebody over and [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6544.58s)]
*  see something that's not right and bring in CBF. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6550.98s)]
*  Yeah, especially in China controls Canada. I mean, Canada is now a colony of China, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6553.54s)]
*  which can be used for its resources, obviously. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6558.26s)]
*  Exactly. And they're exploiting that border. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6560.820000000001s)]
*  So to answer the question about what can the feds do, treat it like a national security issue. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6563.06s)]
*  That's what you can do. They've moved to see- [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6568.02s)]
*  Is that more effective than fighting about trannies? [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6570.5s)]
*  A tranny has never tried to kill me. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6575.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not for trannies. Not that I know of. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6579.9400000000005s)]
*  Spending many hours on TV barking about trannies. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6582.02s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6584.74s)]
*  Now this is real. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6587.06s)]
*  In the scope of things that are affecting the quality of life in the people of Maine, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6589.46s)]
*  the transgender athletes, with all due respect to the female athletes who lose to the male athletes [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6593.860000000001s)]
*  who are pretending to be women, it's not as big as this. Not at all. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6600.820000000001s)]
*  No. Yeah, exactly. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6605.14s)]
*  And it needs to be treated like a national security threat and there needs to be a whole [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6607.22s)]
*  of government response to it. You need to use the Environmental Protection Agency to go after these [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6611.54s)]
*  facilities that we know are using unregistered poisons. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6615.46s)]
*  The problem is, is that the weed scammers are not just Chinese. They're American too. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6619.14s)]
*  Walk them up. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6624.9s)]
*  There's a lot of- [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6625.62s)]
*  Walk them up. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6626.58s)]
*  There's so much money. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6627.06s)]
*  I know. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6628.02s)]
*  No, I mean, I have a million friends who grow marijuana. I'm not against everyone who grows [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6628.5s)]
*  marijuana. I'm saying, I know a lot of people who grow marijuana. I think because they're afraid [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6632.74s)]
*  to smoke marijuana from the Chinese drug cartels because it's poison. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6638.42s)]
*  With good reason. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6642.02s)]
*  Or whatever. This is an agricultural state. A lot of people grow marijuana. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6642.66s)]
*  I don't use it, but I get it. I'm talking about the organized money interests in the United States [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6645.78s)]
*  who are constantly lobbying the federal government for their own economic benefit. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6653.3s)]
*  There's a lot of that. Billions of dollars of that. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6658.82s)]
*  Well, I would say Bobby Kennedy should treat this like a national health emergency. It is. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6661.46s)]
*  Whatever your feelings are on legal marijuana, it's here. It's happening. People are consuming [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6668.9800000000005s)]
*  it. It's more popular. There are more daily active marijuana users than daily active [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6673.54s)]
*  alcohol users. This happened just, I think, within the last year or two. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6677.7s)]
*  It's happening. To the extent that these illicit Chinese poisons are making it into that supply, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6682.18s)]
*  it is a national health emergency and it needs to be responded to it just like that. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6687.54s)]
*  But there are powerful economic interests that align with what the Chinese are doing in [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6693.46s)]
*  the Baptist and bootleggers fashion. There are marijuana companies that want to become [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6700.42s)]
*  the Bud Lighter Coarser Light of marijuana. What do they benefit from? A harsh, strict regulatory [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6705.3s)]
*  environment that they can comply with easily. Costs that they have the capital to deal with, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6710.82s)]
*  but the little mom and pop cannabis producers don't. They tolerate and allow and maybe encourage [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6717.62s)]
*  this kind of wild, wild west of which the Chinese marijuana growers are a part. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6724.74s)]
*  Because they know that the Chinese criminal organizations polluting the marijuana environment [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6728.58s)]
*  in Maine will lead to calls for greater regulatory crackdown and a compliance regime that works [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6733.3s)]
*  favorable to their long-term economic interests. There are wealthy companies that give a lot of [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6739.86s)]
*  money to politicians. I would look into who were the biggest donors to Governor Janet Mills' [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6746.26s)]
*  inaugural committee in 2019? Who were they? Big cannabis companies. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6753.38s)]
*  I should just say you're the son of a man who worked at the shoe factory, but you have a fancy [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6759.54s)]
*  college degree. You've got a million different potential life paths and you've chosen to stay [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6766.9s)]
*  in Maine and do this job making much less than you could have made if you'd left with your college [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6772.1s)]
*  degree. And I'm just grateful that you did that. Well, thank you. This is making a difference. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6777.94s)]
*  Thank you. I'm grateful for the help and encouragement that you've given me and [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6782.98s)]
*  the attention to be here. Well, no one else is doing it. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6789.54s)]
*  I know. Why is it falling to you to do this? [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6791.78s)]
*  Honestly, Tucker, you're like my psychotherapist because I feel like I'm Mugatu and Zoolander. I [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6795.62s)]
*  feel like I'm taking crazy pills. As I drive around and I see all these marijuana sites, I'm like, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6802.0199999999995s)]
*  how has it taken this long for somebody to tell this story? So finally for somebody else to be [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6806.099999999999s)]
*  like, yeah, that's a fascinating story. It feels gratifying to the work that we've done. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6812.26s)]
*  And I have to say that it's been like a team wide work that my reporters have had to tolerate me [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6818.34s)]
*  just disappearing into the woods of Maine where there's no cell phone signal for days at a time [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6826.66s)]
*  to do some of this work. And our digital media producer, Graham Pollard, he's one of the best [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6830.58s)]
*  in the country and he single-handedly put together the documentary that we made on this. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6835.860000000001s)]
*  And he's just so wildly talented. And a lot of this, I don't think I could have done [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6840.34s)]
*  without their help and their assistance. And also the readers and supporters of [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6845.219999999999s)]
*  our organization, The Maine Wire, and a lot of the people who were very brave and gave us tips [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6851.46s)]
*  anonymously, people in government, people who work for utility companies, town officials. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6857.0599999999995s)]
*  Once the initial story started coming out, people came to us with a lot of [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6862.9s)]
*  harrowing information that they were too scared to put their name to, but ended up being very [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6868.58s)]
*  useful to us in connecting the dots and being able to tell the story that we've told. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6874.259999999999s)]
*  Godspeed, man. I think you're in danger and I know that you are in danger. So thank you for [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6881.38s)]
*  doing this anyway. Thank you. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6886.259999999999s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising. That's [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6892.099999999999s)]
*  what they do. But on another level, it's shocking. With everything that's going on in the world right [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6897.22s)]
*  now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics, with the wars, one the cusp of [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6901.22s)]
*  fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information rather than more. And that [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6906.5s)]
*  is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. That's [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6912.66s)]
*  a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it, a way that you [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6918.900000000001s)]
*  could actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. The way to do that on [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6923.0599999999995s)]
*  YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe. Hit the little bell icon to be notified [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6928.5s)]
*  when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6933.78s)]
*  actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2AVar-XNc&t=6939.379999999999s)]
