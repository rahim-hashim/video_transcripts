# Neil Oliver How Banks Took Over Empires, and the Truth About WWII, Brexit, & COVID
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ)
*  I find it really strange that people aren't able to make the distinction between regimes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and populations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6.04s)]
*  Well, the whole thing is the same. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7.04s)]
*  If you're angry with the Putin regime, okay, but why would that automatically make you [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=9.72s)]
*  say that you hate Russians? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=15.44s)]
*  But also, compared to- [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=16.44s)]
*  There's 140 million of them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=17.44s)]
*  You can dislike Macron and like French people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=18.72s)]
*  Why can't people make the dist- why do you have to be at war with an entire population [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=21.64s)]
*  just because you don't like the regime? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=25.64s)]
*  It's insane, but moreover, I can like or dislike anyone I want because I'm an adult man and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=27.0s)]
*  I'm not a slave, so I can have any opinion I want. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=33.12s)]
*  We discriminate by nature. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=35.36s)]
*  It's in our nature to discriminate. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=36.36s)]
*  But also, it's my birthright. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=37.88s)]
*  You can't tell me who I have to like and dislike. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=41.36s)]
*  And I'm not going to submit to that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=45.0s)]
*  Last night, we were talking at dinner and you expressed some views and I thought to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=57.0s)]
*  myself, I'm eating with a conspiracy theorist. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=70.52s)]
*  Well, I think if you're not a conspiracy theorist by now, you're not paying attention. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=72.56s)]
*  You are often described that way. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=78.56s)]
*  Does it rattle you? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=80.44s)]
*  Well, it was probably a time when it would have done, but I've gone through this process [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=83.28s)]
*  in the last four years of realizing that I spent the first 50-some years of my life believing [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=89.36s)]
*  and trusting a certain worldview that with Covid and everything thereafter, all of that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=96.68s)]
*  fell apart. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=105.48s)]
*  It's like picking a thread on a tapestry. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=106.48s)]
*  The whole thing just fell away into... [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=110.2s)]
*  Once you lose all of the things that you had taken for granted and trusted, then I suppose [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  almost by definition, you're in territory that others who aren't on the same path as [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=120.44s)]
*  you would call conspiracy theorists. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=124.92s)]
*  But it's really just, you think, well, if I think now that they were lying to me about [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  that and that and that, were they telling me the truth about anything at all? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=131.76s)]
*  And you're aware that some of it must be true, but it's early yet. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=137.8s)]
*  I've only been in this revelatory process. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  The scales have only fallen from my eyes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  My naive trust that I placed in the establishment and in the institutions that I placed in without [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=150.4s)]
*  really thinking about it terribly much. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, you were part of the establishment and you worked for BBC. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=158.12s)]
*  Well, I worked for BBC in as much as I was doing contract work for BBC. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=160.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=164.52s)]
*  I was never directly employed by the British Broadcasting Corporation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=165.52s)]
*  I'd be brought in to do a project and a production company would pitch a project. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=168.24s)]
*  I would be the presenter that was associated with that project and I would be paid by the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  day for the duration of the project and then I wouldn't be working for the BBC. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=177.84s)]
*  I'm just saying that people watched you on BBC. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=181.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure they did. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=184.0s)]
*  I wrote a column for the Sunday Times in Scotland. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=185.0s)]
*  I had been for a while the president of the National Trust for Scotland. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  At one stage I was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=193.32s)]
*  I was certainly associated with and part of the infrastructure of the establishment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  That's absolutely the case. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  But I did all of it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=206.72s)]
*  I hold my hands up and say I did it in a naive way without really interrogating the integrity [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=207.72s)]
*  of those institutions. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  It was just- [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=217.48s)]
*  Oh, I'm not judging you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=218.48s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=219.48s)]
*  I just trusted that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=221.44s)]
*  I've always been a political atheist struggling to vote in general elections, but usually [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=222.76s)]
*  trying to vote for someone to make plain that I was taking part in the democratic process. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=229.0s)]
*  But I've never been affiliated to any political party, any ideology. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=234.72s)]
*  I think I thought that the powers that be had mine and my family's interests at heart, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=244.64s)]
*  whether they were red or blue or whatever. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=251.16s)]
*  I thought basically they're going to keep the lights on. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=254.4s)]
*  They're going to make sure there's food in the supermarkets. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=257.04s)]
*  They'll maintain the roads. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=259.92s)]
*  There'll be schools open. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=260.92s)]
*  There'll be a hospital if my family needs it, regardless. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=261.92s)]
*  But now I just don't feel- well, I now know that the establishment doesn't have mine or [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=267.08s)]
*  my family's interests at heart. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=272.68s)]
*  And that's hard. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=274.4s)]
*  It's like a grieving process, I think. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=275.4s)]
*  The analogy I would make with that, the five stages of grief that we're supposed to go [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=277.84s)]
*  through, the shock, the denial, the bargaining, the anger, the various stages that you're [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=281.08s)]
*  supposed to go through. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=287.24s)]
*  I'm still, I'm probably four years in just coming to that point where I'm making peace [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=288.24s)]
*  with the fact that it's my responsibility that I didn't see the reality. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  That's me. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  So for a while I was angry with them and I still am angry with them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  But baddies are just baddies. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=309.36s)]
*  Baddies do what baddies do. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=312.12s)]
*  My problem is that I feel, oh, it's my fault. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=313.76s)]
*  I should have seen that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  I should have- [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=318.92s)]
*  I'm with you 100%. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=319.92s)]
*  I should have understood. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=320.92s)]
*  How could I have been so stupid? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=321.92s)]
*  So I just think it's really interesting that there's an overwhelming amount of evidence [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=323.76s)]
*  to support what you just said. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=327.92s)]
*  That the people in charge do not have your or your family's interests at heart at all. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=329.28s)]
*  In fact, they're working against those interests day and night for whatever reason. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=332.92s)]
*  I don't think any honest person can deny that at this point, four years in. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=337.76s)]
*  Why, well, compound question. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=341.96s)]
*  What percentage of your friends in 2020 arrived at the same conclusions you have arrived at? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=347.72s)]
*  And what's the difference between you and those who didn't admit what was happening? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=353.98s)]
*  I would say I've lost touch with everyone from before. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  Really everyone? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=367.04s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm still obviously, I'm still my family. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=368.04s)]
*  into which I was born and also my married family, my in-laws. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=372.36s)]
*  We've all remained as close as we ever were, although, you know, there were differences [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=377.92s)]
*  of opinion about whatever, what COVID was about the products, the jabs and so on. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=384.06s)]
*  So there were differences of opinion, but it didn't cause any ill feeling or any schisms [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=390.24s)]
*  there. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=395.76s)]
*  We're still fully, we're still, it's all very loving and close, but work colleagues, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=396.76s)]
*  friends, you know, people that I had known in some instances from university days, people [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=404.36s)]
*  that I had worked beside. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=408.96s)]
*  Broadly, broadly, I've lost touch with all of them. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=410.92s)]
*  There's a handful of people, literally, you know, count on the fingers of one handed people [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=413.92s)]
*  that as it turns out, ended up with all of the same suspicions and have ended up every [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=418.52s)]
*  bit as conspiracist as me. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  As I'm sure you would testify, well, I don't know, I'm not going to, I'm not going to, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=426.44s)]
*  you know, prejudge your experience, but those people that I partied company with, that void [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=431.04s)]
*  has been filled. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=439.12s)]
*  That vacuum drew into a whole other cast of people, in many cases, very unlikely and unexpected. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=441.04s)]
*  It was very, it was Trudy and I, my wife and I, we would laugh about, you know, who are [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=449.04s)]
*  you on the phone? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  I would come off the phone from now and I would say, and it would seem so bizarre and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=454.96s)]
*  so unlikely. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=458.56s)]
*  People that a few years ago, I never imagined I would ever have a conversation with, not [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  for any particular reason, but I just didn't expect to be pulled into their orbit or them [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=464.64s)]
*  into mine. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=469.24s)]
*  So I've been through this process of, of shedding one carapace, feeling very exposed, I suppose, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=470.76s)]
*  like something that has cast like a crab without its shell until the shell hardens again. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=478.4s)]
*  You know, so very raw nerves jangling, but now it's forming again. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=483.68s)]
*  And I would say I was supposed to torture that analogy a little bit. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=489.92s)]
*  I feel a little bit bigger. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=492.04s)]
*  You know, I feel as if I have grown because I wouldn't go back if I could press a button [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=493.04s)]
*  and make the COVID debacle not have happened. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=500.08s)]
*  I wouldn't because the, what I've learned and what I feel I now understand, or, or at [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=503.16s)]
*  least that, which I think I now have enough wit to ask the relevant questions to better [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=510.12s)]
*  understand, I wouldn't exchange where I was for where I am now. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=516.4s)]
*  So back to a shallow, dishonest life. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=521.36s)]
*  You know, and I did, I lost all those affiliations that I had, you know, because of the kind [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=523.64s)]
*  of television persona that I had when I was making soft history and archeology documentaries, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=527.92s)]
*  you get invited to be patron of this representative of that, you know, just people want affiliation [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=537.36s)]
*  with you. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=543.6s)]
*  So, you know, I was, I was connected to combat stress, which was a veterans charity and I [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=544.6s)]
*  was connected to, uh, you know, the, the association of lighthouse keepers. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  And is that a big one in Scotland? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=555.64s)]
*  No, it's a very fringe little group that people that look after the lighthouse keepers. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=556.92s)]
*  As I say, you know, I had an, I had an agent and I had, uh, I had a column in this Sunday [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=564.36s)]
*  Times. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=569.84s)]
*  I had been the president of the national trust. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=570.84s)]
*  I was a fellow of the Royal society and all of that's I'm not anymore. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=571.84s)]
*  I'm not any of those things anymore. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=575.08s)]
*  They all distance themselves from me one by one like dominoes dominoes toppling and it [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=576.36s)]
*  hurts at the time or the first one does like the first punch in the face, you know, you [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=582.52s)]
*  never get, you know, every punch you get there after is sore, but it doesn't have the shock [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=586.6s)]
*  value of the, of the first one. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  Uh, and so once the party company with the one, Oh yeah, yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=593.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=598.44s)]
*  I can see that coming. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=599.44s)]
*  And it's just a, it's just a process that I'm glad to be on for me, for us, my family. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=601.08s)]
*  I've been, this is, I think of this as the great sorting. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=608.76s)]
*  I mean, under this immense downward pressure exerted on the West over the last four years, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=611.4s)]
*  people sort of wound up on one side or the other and it's not a clean political divide. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=617.44s)]
*  It's not even a political divide. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  As you pointed out, it's not left, right, you know, laboratory, whatever, but I've never [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  figured out and I've thought about it a lot. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=627.4000000000001s)]
*  What is it in people that compelled them to move to one side or the other, particularly [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=629.72s)]
*  to the side you're on? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=636.36s)]
*  You said it's unlikely people that you never thought you'd be talking to. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=637.36s)]
*  Like what do they all have in common? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  It's a question that, you know, Trudy and I and others in a small group of like-minded [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=641.44s)]
*  people, that is the $64,000. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=648.6s)]
*  Okay, so you've thought about this. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=650.92s)]
*  As they used to say, what is the, what's the common denominator? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=652.24s)]
*  What's the unifying feature? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't really know. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=656.76s)]
*  I think it's, I think there has been a great sorting. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=658.36s)]
*  I think this, what happened in 2020, 2021, the choices that we were invited to make, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=663.28s)]
*  you know, pick a side, are you going to be with us or not? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=671.64s)]
*  And a large number of people decided to be with the part, to remain part of the main, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  the liars and other people pulled back from it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=682.24s)]
*  This was the great sorting of our generation. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=686.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=689.1600000000001s)]
*  The first big sorting like that, that has been for decades. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  And I think in some of it, I think was simply down to people's natural, you know, amygdala [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=696.44s)]
*  fight or flight response to threat. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=701.88s)]
*  I think some people, you know, people, you don't know until whatever the gunfire starts, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=705.04s)]
*  whether you can't predict it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=709.7199999999999s)]
*  You think you're brave. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=711.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=712.9599999999999s)]
*  And you know, people like, you know, people at Jordan Peterson, you know, have articulated [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=713.9599999999999s)]
*  it very well that the culture of movies that we were all invited to watch growing up, you're [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=717.8s)]
*  invited to think in World War II, you'd have been with the French resistance. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=727.9599999999999s)]
*  You would have hidden your neighbors because the black van was outside going to take them [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  away. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=733.3199999999999s)]
*  That's how people are invited to think that they would be the maverick. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=734.6s)]
*  You would be the one that stands in the face of the tide. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  And then it happened. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=743.08s)]
*  Before people realized what happened, they had been sorted in that way. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=745.12s)]
*  And I think the really part of what's really difficult now is that there's no going back. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=750.72s)]
*  And yet we're all still living together. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=758.72s)]
*  We're all still, all the people are broadly still there. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=760.96s)]
*  Those that jumped one way and those that jumped the other. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=764.9200000000001s)]
*  And we have to find this way to go on because we were invited to see what some, what a lot [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=769.0400000000001s)]
*  of people were prepared to do. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=777.96s)]
*  One of the most difficult parts of it, it sounds silly now because it's really a detail, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=779.96s)]
*  quite early on when the mask mandate was still very much everyone had to wear a face mask. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=789.0s)]
*  And I was, I was having to go up and down to London for work. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=793.88s)]
*  I was flying home every Sunday morning and it would be, I don't know, British Airways [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=798.36s)]
*  flight or whoever. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=803.26s)]
*  And I wasn't wearing a face mask and under any circumstances. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=805.12s)]
*  And I would go through the airport, which was difficult enough. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=811.38s)]
*  Wait, if I can just ask you to pause, why weren't you wearing a face mask? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=814.0s)]
*  Would it just be easier to do what everyone else does and be obedient? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=817.12s)]
*  Why are you so disobedient? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=820.32s)]
*  Well, again, I was always, I was always a rule keeper, a law abider. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=821.32s)]
*  I've always had, you know, I've never, I've never been a protest or I've never been an [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=827.2s)]
*  activist, anything. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=830.52s)]
*  I'm very much a, I'm a, you know, I just was always, I wasn't really paying attention. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=831.52s)]
*  That's the truth of it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=838.52s)]
*  I just wasn't really watching what was going on. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=839.52s)]
*  We were making archeology documentaries. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=841.36s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=843.16s)]
*  I had my own things going on, but to get back to the plane. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=844.48s)]
*  So it would be awkward enough. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=846.64s)]
*  People watching you in the airport, but then I would go up the steps of the plane, the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=848.78s)]
*  crew, the cabin crew would be masked and they would say, you're not wearing a face mask. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=852.76s)]
*  And I would say, no, I'm not wearing a face mask. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  Are you exempt? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=861.8399999999999s)]
*  Some of them would say, and I would just say, yeah, I'm exempt because in my head I was [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=862.8399999999999s)]
*  because I thought I'm a, as a human being, I'm definitely exempt from this nonsense. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  So I wasn't even lying in my own head. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=870.16s)]
*  I thought, no, I am exempt because there's no point in this. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=872.08s)]
*  I'm not a slave. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=875.36s)]
*  You turn right down into the body of the plane and be 299 people with face masks on glaring, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=876.36s)]
*  glaring at me. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=882.88s)]
*  And I would think it's, it's, it's this close. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=883.88s)]
*  You know, if, if someone gave the signal to, you know, let's pin this guy down in the aisle, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=887.72s)]
*  let's eat him. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=892.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=893.08s)]
*  You could see suddenly you could see, I am actually at risk here, not from the establishment [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=894.08s)]
*  necessarily, not from the government in this moment. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=899.24s)]
*  I'm just, I'm just because I have made myself conspicuous. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=902.28s)]
*  I have stood out from the norm and anything could happen in the next five minutes. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=906.0799999999999s)]
*  And I'd have to do the long walk down to my seat, 27E or something, some middle seat. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=912.4s)]
*  And I have to get into it. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=916.88s)]
*  And sometimes people either side of me would ring the service bell, put the light on, ask [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=918.3199999999999s)]
*  to be moved to get away from me. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=922.92s)]
*  And of course they couldn't because it was a full flight. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=925.28s)]
*  And then I would have to sit for the hour and 15 minutes or whatever of the flight back [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=927.04s)]
*  up to Edinburgh as pariah and then get off the plane and I, and then rinse and repeat, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=930.78s)]
*  do it next week, do it next week, do it next week. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=936.62s)]
*  Did it? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=938.9s)]
*  It just, like I said, that's a silly anecdote. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=939.9s)]
*  It's not silly at all. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=942.62s)]
*  It's totally real. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=943.62s)]
*  And everybody's suddenly you suddenly I saw people and he's saying, gosh, it's, you could [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=944.62s)]
*  suddenly see how things happen. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=949.14s)]
*  Questioned you had thought, I wonder how they got that to happen in Germany in the thirties. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=951.1s)]
*  I wonder how they got that to happen in the terror in France and the, you know, of course, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=954.42s)]
*  19th century. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=959.38s)]
*  I wonder how they got that to happen in Russia. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=960.38s)]
*  Well, I don't ask myself that anymore. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=963.06s)]
*  Because you think, oh. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=964.9799999999999s)]
*  You may have come to the obvious conclusion that the real debate is not between Republican [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=967.02s)]
*  and Democrat or socialist and capitalist, right, left. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=970.7399999999999s)]
*  The real battles between people who are lying on purpose and people who are trying to tell [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=976.2199999999999s)]
*  you the truth. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=980.88s)]
*  It's between good and evil. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=982.42s)]
*  It's between honesty and falsehood. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=983.8599999999999s)]
*  And we hope we are on the former side. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=986.76s)]
*  That's why we created this network, the Tucker Carlson Network, and we invite you to subscribe [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=989.56s)]
*  to it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=993.16s)]
*  Go to Tucker Carlson dot com slash podcast. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=994.16s)]
*  Our entire archive is there. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=996.8s)]
*  A lot of behind the scenes footage of what actually happens in this barn when only an [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=997.96s)]
*  iPhone is running. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1002.24s)]
*  Tucker Carlson dot com slash podcast. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1003.84s)]
*  You will not regret it. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1007.98s)]
*  So you said that in public. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1009.36s)]
*  You said famously something close to what you just said, which is, oh, now I understand [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1010.96s)]
*  how totalitarian movements sort of move downward into the population. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1016.0s)]
*  And the population, by and large, supports some genocidal agenda that normal people wouldn't [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1021.56s)]
*  support. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1026.28s)]
*  But they do support it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1027.28s)]
*  And you said that and you were attacked as a bigot for saying that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1028.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1031.32s)]
*  But you must have been on the same. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1032.32s)]
*  Surely you were getting the... [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1035.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1036.36s)]
*  What was your experience? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1037.36s)]
*  Don't pay any attention at all. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1039.08s)]
*  So I'm sure I've been called every name. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1040.4s)]
*  I don't care at all. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1041.84s)]
*  I had checked out mentally for sure. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1045.2s)]
*  But what is it about why? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1048.84s)]
*  You know, you've clearly been more sort of, I suppose, bullheaded, stubborn about things [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1050.72s)]
*  and being prepared to stand in the face of things for longer than me. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1055.84s)]
*  So what's in... [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1059.02s)]
*  When you were asking me what did I think was the common denominator, what was uniting all [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1061.06s)]
*  of the people that were refusing to go along with it? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1066.48s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1069.48s)]
*  Well, I just grew up in a different way. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1070.48s)]
*  So I just knew that the majority opinion was not always right. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1072.12s)]
*  I always felt that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1076.6799999999998s)]
*  And I knew that I didn't care what people thought of me except the people I love just [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1078.2399999999998s)]
*  because of the way I grew up. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1083.9199999999998s)]
*  So it was not hard for me at all to take a position that is different from everyone else's. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1087.3999999999999s)]
*  I only care about the people directly around me. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1093.4399999999998s)]
*  So that's just my temperament. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1096.4799999999998s)]
*  What about then the plight of a concept like democracy? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1097.4799999999998s)]
*  We talk a lot. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1101.3999999999999s)]
*  We're brought up in the West to talk about democracy and liberty and freedom and rights. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1102.3999999999999s)]
*  What do you... [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1111.1599999999999s)]
*  What's your take on the reality of what democracy even means now? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1112.28s)]
*  Because for me, I have been forced through a process of thinking about what democracy [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1118.0s)]
*  even is and wondering what it is that we had that we called democracy. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1124.1s)]
*  And certainly wondering what it is that we have now, if anything, of that which we used to call democracy. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1131.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, democracy, at least in my view, I mean, it's been redefined to mean democracy is a [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1136.1399999999999s)]
*  system of government in which the people in charge, whether the elected officials, the [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1140.58s)]
*  agency heads, the people who run well-funded NGOs, when their views are represented, even [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1146.4199999999998s)]
*  though they may constitute 2% of the population's views, when those views are represented, when [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1153.4199999999998s)]
*  they're fully in charge, you can do whatever they want. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1158.34s)]
*  That's democracy. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1159.8999999999999s)]
*  That's not my view of democracy. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1160.8999999999999s)]
*  My view of democracy is much more primitive, kind of the peasant view of democracy, which [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1162.1s)]
*  is it's a species of private property. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1165.3s)]
*  It's ownership. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1167.4199999999998s)]
*  I am a citizen of this country. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1168.6999999999998s)]
*  I was born here. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1170.22s)]
*  So were my parents. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1171.22s)]
*  And I therefore have a share in this. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1173.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm a shareholder in the country. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1175.34s)]
*  Like I own part of this mine, actually. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1177.06s)]
*  No, I own one 350 millionth of it, but it's still ownership. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1178.8999999999999s)]
*  It's still a share. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1183.74s)]
*  You can't treat me like a slave or even your servant because this is my place. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1185.7s)]
*  And that's what I think democracy is. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1194.1s)]
*  It's almost like a temperamental... [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1195.74s)]
*  It's a description of the certain worldview that you have about your government and your [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1199.18s)]
*  relationship to that government. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1203.66s)]
*  So that's how I feel about it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1204.74s)]
*  It doesn't mean that if 51% of the population wants something, it gets it every time. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1206.94s)]
*  We have a representative democracy, a constitutional republic, as I'm often reminded. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1211.22s)]
*  But basically, if you have a system where the people in charge don't care at all about [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1215.42s)]
*  what the population thinks, we know for sure that's not democracy. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1219.14s)]
*  I mean, what did you think it was? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1222.46s)]
*  Well, as you just said, I, in a state of semi-slumber, just imagined that I was represented in the [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1225.42s)]
*  places of power by the fact that I was able to vote. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1237.42s)]
*  And I now realize that voting once every four or five years is nothing at all. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1243.6200000000001s)]
*  That's a completely meaningless transaction to me now. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1249.38s)]
*  It always was. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1253.18s)]
*  I mean, I see now why I was, oh God, it's a general election. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1254.18s)]
*  I better vote for somebody. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1257.9s)]
*  I was always very disconnected from it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1258.9s)]
*  But now I partly think that that may have been some kind of semi-instinctive realization [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1262.7s)]
*  that it was meaningless anyway. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1267.7800000000002s)]
*  I worry now about quite a lot of people around me talk about direct democracy as a solution [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1272.5s)]
*  to our problems. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1281.86s)]
*  It's always this Swiss model that's quoted, referenda about this, that, and everything. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1284.62s)]
*  Sort everything by having a referendum about it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1290.9399999999998s)]
*  Having gone through the last four years, that worries me because if there had been a referendum [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1295.1799999999998s)]
*  about face masks or lockdown or, God forbid, mandatory jabs, we'd have got all of them. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1301.26s)]
*  The majority vote would have enacted all of those things, mandated jabs, longer, tighter [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1311.66s)]
*  lockdowns, face masks, and all of the rest of it would have been enacted by direct democracy. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1318.7s)]
*  I think the problem you've got there is the majority, you better hope they come to your conclusion. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1325.42s)]
*  Because otherwise, if we take the step of thinking that direct democracy is the way [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1337.02s)]
*  to get us out of these problems, well, in short, I live in fear of direct democracy. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1343.5800000000002s)]
*  So why do you think they're saying that? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1349.1000000000001s)]
*  People leave out, I'm very familiar with Switzerland. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1351.06s)]
*  I have ancestors from Switzerland, spent a lot, went to school in Switzerland, been there [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1353.7s)]
*  almost twice this year. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1357.7s)]
*  I'm not an expert on Switzerland, but I know it well enough to say conclusively their political [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1358.9s)]
*  system works because they have a Swiss population with certain attitudes that have evolved over [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1363.3s)]
*  a thousand years. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1368.74s)]
*  It works for them. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1371.7s)]
*  They vote twice a year and all this stuff. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1372.82s)]
*  The cantons have a lot of independent power, very weak central government, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1374.74s)]
*  But that works with Swiss people. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1379.78s)]
*  They're changing the population of the West and particularly of Europe so fast that you [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1382.18s)]
*  sort of wonder, like, what is that? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1390.1s)]
*  I mean, the idea that there is a thing called a Britain or a Spaniard or a Frenchman or [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1392.98s)]
*  Portuguese people or Belgians or people from Liechtenstein or whatever, that there are [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1399.06s)]
*  sort of populations, indigenous populations in these countries that have a certain national [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1403.94s)]
*  character and language and shared history. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1408.82s)]
*  All of that is being obliterated by mass immigration. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1411.7s)]
*  It's on purpose. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1416.6599999999999s)]
*  It's against the will of the populations, existing populations of those countries, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1417.78s)]
*  and it's clearly tied to political power. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1421.7s)]
*  Am I missing something? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1425.3s)]
*  I mean, look, this is my view from 3,000 miles away. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1426.02s)]
*  No, without a shadow of a doubt, I think the same thing is happening right here. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1428.6599999999999s)]
*  It's obliterating the United States, but it's harder for Americans to fight back against [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1434.58s)]
*  it because there's no, I mean, our indigenous population, you know, or the American Indians [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1438.42s)]
*  who aren't even really the indigenous population, but whatever, they were here before [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1443.8600000000001s)]
*  the Europeans arrived. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1447.0600000000002s)]
*  They replaced another population was here before them, but whatever. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1448.9s)]
*  The point is we don't have kind of the, we don't feel we have the moral standing that [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1451.54s)]
*  say the Scots would have. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1456.9s)]
*  Scotland was never or has not been in a very long time and a colonial power. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1459.0600000000002s)]
*  Like what, why are they doing this to Scotland? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1463.7s)]
*  Identity is a sense of identity, personal identity, you know, the sovereign individual. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1465.62s)]
*  And then that coming together to be, you know, maybe a sense of community in your town. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1472.1s)]
*  Then, and it broadens out to national identity is problematic. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1478.34s)]
*  I'm utterly convinced that there's a, there's a, just a huge centralization of power going on. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1484.7399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1490.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, that there's a, there is a, you know, there's a, an anonymous faceless cabal of people [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1490.82s)]
*  whose names we don't know, whose faces we wouldn't recognize, who are centralizing power. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1495.94s)]
*  And for the first time, the technology is enabling that to be global. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1501.7s)]
*  People have tried it in the past, you know, whatever people have tried to be, have been [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1506.02s)]
*  totalitarian in the past, but it's the technology and the, and the reach has never enabled a tyrant [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1510.5s)]
*  to control the whole world. But that is there now. And I think that's what we are, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1518.98s)]
*  what we are hurtling towards. And, you know, people like Eric Hoffer and the true believer and so on, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1523.6200000000001s)]
*  you know, he, he wrote so effectively about how every mass movement has sought to take away people's [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1529.94s)]
*  national identity and their personal identity. So they want you to, they want you to, they want [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1537.3s)]
*  each individual to turn their back on their parents and on their family as being, you know, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1543.14s)]
*  you can do better than these people. Their ideas are outmoded. You know, they've, they've messed [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1548.9s)]
*  you up and you'd be, you'd be better off without that influence. And likewise, they want to cut [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1553.6200000000001s)]
*  people away from their national roots, their sense of belonging in a place and their sense that they [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1558.5s)]
*  are British or that they are French. Because once you get people deracinated in that way, cut away [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1563.8600000000001s)]
*  from their roots. And the process is also about making people ashamed of their history, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1570.34s)]
*  be it their own family history or their national history. So that there's nothing in the past, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1577.78s)]
*  but things to be ashamed of. So you get people to disavow the past, to disavow their parents, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1582.4199999999998s)]
*  to disavow the family, to disavow the, the nation as it's been understood. And then those people [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1588.1799999999998s)]
*  are just dots on a spreadsheet. They're just, they're just flickering dots on a screen that [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1594.1799999999998s)]
*  can be put anywhere. And you have, and now you have a global population that don't belong [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1598.58s)]
*  or feel connected to anywhere. And so you can put them anywhere because they have no roots. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1605.46s)]
*  And that's been tried over and over again. All the great faiths have done something, attempted [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1612.4199999999998s)]
*  something similar. All the great ideologies, all the isms, fascism, communism, whatever, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1617.46s)]
*  they all seek to do the, to, as Hoffer explains it in True Believer, they all apply the same tools [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1624.58s)]
*  to get people disconnected until you're just a lone individual that's ready to don a uniform [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1630.82s)]
*  and do something new in the face of utopia. You know, the, the nowhere place that is the ideal [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1636.8999999999999s)]
*  future. That's easy to sell people because it doesn't actually exist. But it, what it means [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1643.1399999999999s)]
*  is total destruction. I mean, I see mass immigration in Europe as a form of warfare against [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1647.06s)]
*  the indigenous population. They're being destroyed and degraded. Very obvious to me as a serial [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1652.9s)]
*  visitor to that continent over 50 years. And it gets worse every time I go there. But I noticed [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1658.26s)]
*  that the people who are from there, whose parents were born there, whose ancestors are a thousand [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1664.42s)]
*  years ago, in your case, wearing like face paint and skirts with spears or whatever, scary Highland [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1668.9s)]
*  tribes, like none of those people feel free to stand up and say, what are you doing? Like, no, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1676.1000000000001s)]
*  you can't flood my country with people from another place because they're not Scottish. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1681.86s)]
*  And I am, and you're wrecking my country. Why can't that's not racist? That's just obvious. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1685.3799999999999s)]
*  And it's also, I mean, it's also important to remember all the time that these people are [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1689.1399999999999s)]
*  being uprooted and moved in their turn as well. Oh, I agree. All, everyone. And so, you know, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1693.1399999999999s)]
*  so what happens is yes, people, indigenous populations are being flooded by people from [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1699.3799999999999s)]
*  elsewhere, but those people have been uprooted by this, you know, by, by the same, you know, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1704.82s)]
*  by the same forces of chaos and disruption. You know, the West has done God awful things to one [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1710.6599999999999s)]
*  country of the Middle East and elsewhere, one after another African countries. And those people [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1716.82s)]
*  are, are, are cut, have been cut away from the roots and they're on the move as well. So everyone's [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1721.6999999999998s)]
*  victim in this, everyone, and where people turn up in large numbers where they, you know, from a, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1727.6999999999998s)]
*  from an ethnic and cultural inherited point of view don't belong, but that's also not their fault. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1734.58s)]
*  You know, they're, they're pawns on the board as well. And of course, what happens is that the, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1739.5400000000002s)]
*  the people, you know, the resident, the incumbent population feel threatened by the arrival of the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1745.0600000000002s)]
*  new and they get angry with the incomers when really we should all link up. Everyone should link [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1750.3400000000001s)]
*  arms and say, who did this? Like calm down everyone. Just for let's, let's sort out exactly [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1756.18s)]
*  how this has happened. Are we being manipulated? Why are you, why are you, who's moved you here? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1761.7s)]
*  You know, so it's important because that you fall, you fall so readily into that. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1766.74s)]
*  I agree. But do you have that conversation in Scotland specifically? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1770.42s)]
*  It's very difficult because of course, everything, any kind of descent, any kind of, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1774.34s)]
*  of raising a voice in that way, it brings out the same predictable tools from the toolbox. So you [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1780.18s)]
*  get, you just get caught, you know, I've, I've long ago, you know, I've been described as anti-Semitic [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1787.1399999999999s)]
*  for one reason and another, I've been described as quite supremacist for one reason and another. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1793.14s)]
*  You know, I've had all the labels and you know, you said right at the beginning, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1798.8200000000002s)]
*  you're now known as a conspiracy theorist. They're almost badges of honor. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1804.18s)]
*  If you're not being tarred with those brushes, then you're not, you're not doing your bit [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1809.14s)]
*  because if you can immediately, that old line about, you know, that you're over the target when [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1814.0200000000002s)]
*  you're taking flak, if you're being, if they've got to go, if they've got nothing better than [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1818.42s)]
*  to call you anti-Semitic, white supremacist, whatever, then you think, oh, I must be, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1823.22s)]
*  I must be doing something right because that's just the same old box of clumsy, blunt tools [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1827.94s)]
*  that get brought out to shout down anyone who's actually asking important pertinent questions. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1834.9s)]
*  But we're not going to answer them because we're not going to give them the answer because the [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1840.26s)]
*  answer will expose us, the baddies even further. So let's just, let's just dismiss them as [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1842.9s)]
*  is, does it still work in Scotland in the UK? Well, I think as I say, because many people [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1848.26s)]
*  are now finding that it's a badge of honor to be, you know, I've been, I've been a putin [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1854.98s)]
*  apologist stuff at that one flung at me. I've been all sorts of things just because I've, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1859.7800000000002s)]
*  I've said, you know, we're jumping into all of these stories at the moment in the, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1865.14s)]
*  in the third act was actually the expression that Jimmy Doar used to me when I had him on my show [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1869.14s)]
*  the other week. And he said, you know, everyone was invited to join the Ukraine story in the [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1874.3400000000001s)]
*  third act. But you know, there's pages and pages of this, of this play before you get to the Russian [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1878.1000000000001s)]
*  tanks, trundling across the Ukrainian border. You're coming in late. You've joined the cinema [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1885.94s)]
*  in the last, in the last- Well, there'd been a war in progress for eight years. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1889.8600000000001s)]
*  And, and, and now it's, you know, now it's Israel Gaza and everyone's invited to like that all [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1893.46s)]
*  started on October the seventh. And you go, no, no, no, no, no. So, so it's all, it's all obvious. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1898.9s)]
*  It's all obvious stuff. And because those turn spotlights onto places and stories and back stories [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1903.94s)]
*  that the, that the troublemakers, the original troublemakers do not want to be confronted with [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1913.22s)]
*  then hence shutting everything down, censorship, labeling, you know, dismissing people as, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1917.86s)]
*  you know, well, whatever, whatever bad name they can think of. How long do they take you to get, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1925.1399999999999s)]
*  to decide you didn't care what they called you? Again, it's, again, it's that thing about, you [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1930.34s)]
*  know, the first time you get punched, it hurts, but worse than the pain, it's the shock. But then [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1934.8999999999999s)]
*  the next time you get punched, you think, Oh yeah, that's, that's that again. And I suppose [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1940.1s)]
*  around the time, because I came into all of this, I suppose, or I was seen to come into all of this [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1947.78s)]
*  around COVID and lockdowns and vaccines for children and all of the rest of it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1953.3s)]
*  But then, as I say, once I picked that thread and then everything started to, then the big tapestry [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1958.1799999999998s)]
*  all started to fray and unfurl. Then the next thing that came up then was Ukraine. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1964.58s)]
*  And suddenly people who had, there was this loose coalition, I suppose, this fragile thing of people [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1970.1s)]
*  coming together around the COVID debacle and asking the right questions and being militant [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1977.78s)]
*  enough and saying, no, there was a cohesion there. But the Ukraine, it was as though the powers that, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1983.6999999999998s)]
*  right, we've been rumbled on COVID, let's get a war going, wars are great. And then, and so Ukraine [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1989.86s)]
*  started and a lot of the people that had been, that had briefed, it was like in awakenings, you [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=1997.54s)]
*  know, the Oliver Sacks, Robert De Niro movie, it was like people had briefly come awake. Just when [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2002.4199999999998s)]
*  the Ukraine war started, they all just went back to where they had been before, listening to the [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2008.8999999999999s)]
*  propaganda, just taking the official line, accepting the official narrative. And so I suppose [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2013.62s)]
*  it was when I started being accused of being an apologist for Putin, I thought, I've already been [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2020.7399999999998s)]
*  an aluminium tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist, anti-vaxxer, you know, granny killer. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2028.4199999999998s)]
*  Now I'm a Putin apologist. Well, fair enough. I've seen the way this works. And now that I've [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2035.1399999999999s)]
*  collected that badge, like a scout, I can put that one on my sleeve as well. Now I'm a Putin [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2041.62s)]
*  apologist. And I definitely don't, I really don't care about it. Because if you're not being, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2045.6999999999998s)]
*  if you're not being accused of being a whatever label, then you're not in the debate. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2052.02s)]
*  I just reject the whole premise, which is that some group of people who really kind of hate you [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2058.5s)]
*  or have contempt for you at the very least can decide who your enemies are, and then require you [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2063.7799999999997s)]
*  to agree with them. I've never had really strong feelings about Russia. I certainly wasn't mad at [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2070.18s)]
*  Russia. Why would I be? They never did anything to me. But like Toria Nuland in our State Department [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2076.2599999999998s)]
*  decides, well, they're our main enemy for whatever weird reason she has for deciding that. And now I [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2081.46s)]
*  have to sign on to that. Like I'm an adult man. I can decide who I like and who I don't like. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2087.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't, the whole idea of it. Well, get on board. Well, I don't know. Maybe I don't want to. Like [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2091.54s)]
*  what? Who would go along with that? How could any adult allow some far away office holder, agency [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2096.58s)]
*  head or NGO director to decide what their opinions should be? What are your opinions as a father of [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2103.38s)]
*  three, a married man with a job, like what you have to believe? Does that seem weird to you? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2108.66s)]
*  It does seem, well, it does seem weird to me. I think people are frightened. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2113.62s)]
*  Of what? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2118.9s)]
*  Well, you know, I've, as I was talking about that experience on the plane with my bare faced, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2119.4s)]
*  literally, you know, defiance of that, that Dick tat, it's extremely uncomfortable to stick out, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2126.84s)]
*  to put your head up, to be noticed. Yeah. I suppose, you know, actually in answer to your [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2134.84s)]
*  earlier question about what would be a unifying, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2142.76s)]
*  characteristic of people that said, no, I suppose I had already had a long time of being recognisable [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2149.8s)]
*  to some people because of the kind of tele, I have low level familiarity, celebrity, whatever. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2159.4s)]
*  Some people would recognise me from television documentaries that I had made. And so I had grown [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2165.1600000000003s)]
*  a kind of a, a harder shell about being looked at and, you know, whispered about it, noticed. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2169.56s)]
*  So that sticking out in that way, I was already slightly familiar with. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2176.2s)]
*  Whereas I think for, for people who had had, who had enjoyed complete anonymity, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2181.8799999999997s)]
*  and then it came to say the COVID thing and not wearing a face mask or asking questions about [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2187.0s)]
*  what was, what the, what the children should or shouldn't put in their bodies. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2191.3199999999997s)]
*  It's very uncomfortable to, to stand up and be noticed, to be visible. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2195.64s)]
*  And so because I had, I suppose had a little bit of, a little bit of, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2201.8799999999997s)]
*  I'd grown a little bit of a callous, a little bit of hard skin about being noticed because I had, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2205.64s)]
*  I was a face from television. I suppose made it a little bit less uncomfortable for me [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2210.68s)]
*  to then be spotlight about for the first time in my life, controversial issues. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2215.8799999999997s)]
*  I'd never been controversial in my life, but at least I was slightly, you know, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2221.7999999999997s)]
*  slightly familiar with being noticed. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2228.12s)]
*  When you started to get attacked as a bigot, a crazy person, white supremacist, whatever that is. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2230.44s)]
*  How did the people you love, like how did your wife react? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2237.08s)]
*  Well, you know, Trudy's here and Trudy's in this room and we've been a hundred percent together [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2241.4s)]
*  on all of it. She's never blinked, you know, from, from it all, from it all began. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2250.84s)]
*  And so I've always had that absolute, for so many people where a split happened between partners [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2255.64s)]
*  over some of this, I can't imagine how awful that must be because it's hard enough. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2266.44s)]
*  I can't imagine it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2271.08s)]
*  I can't imagine it, but we've always been a hundred percent together on it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2271.8799999999997s)]
*  And even where in our wider families, you know, where people, you know, took the jabs and whatever, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2274.92s)]
*  there's never been any, never been any trouble with being noticed. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2279.56s)]
*  There's never been any, never been any trouble differences of opinion and people thinking, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2283.16s)]
*  what was the right thing to do? What was the wrong thing to do? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2288.7599999999998s)]
*  But no ranker, no, you know, no, no, no shouting, no, nothing like that. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2290.7599999999998s)]
*  And so I've always, I've mercifully, thankfully, I've never been more grateful in my life for, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2296.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, for Trudy because of the way that she responded. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2303.16s)]
*  But it's a big change. I mean, if you're, you know, if you're married to someone who's on television [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2305.88s)]
*  and she's famous for, I don't know, his views on the Vikings and everyone kind of likes you for that. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2310.36s)]
*  And all of a sudden he's being called, you know, a white supremacist. That's a big change. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2314.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yes, it is. But as I say, she just never blinked. You know, she didn't blink. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2319.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, you are blessed. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2325.2400000000002s)]
*  In the game of chicken, she just didn't blink. She knew, she knows me. She's known me since I was 19. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2326.04s)]
*  And, you know, when it comes to being called things like anti-Semitic or racist or misogynist [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2332.1200000000003s)]
*  or whatever, whatever, repute and apologists, she knows me. So she doesn't have to wonder. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2338.04s)]
*  Is he? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2344.44s)]
*  You know, because she just, she just knows. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2345.08s)]
*  She's smiling. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2347.88s)]
*  No, you're just really, really fortunate to have that. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2349.4s)]
*  Well, well, well, yes, yes, fortunate. But we also, I suppose, you know, you have to kind of think, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2353.16s)]
*  well, we probably, you know, chose one another and stayed for reasons. And then you think, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2359.48s)]
*  as it turns out, you know, this being, you know, this being a testing situation, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2367.7999999999997s)]
*  this would be part of why I chose this person. Because one way or another, I think I probably [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2373.0s)]
*  knew that she'd be like this in a situation like this, you know, and me for her, you know, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2379.0s)]
*  we would just, we just back each other up, which does make you very invulnerable because this whole, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2385.3999999999996s)]
*  this whole process has absolutely, in a way that's cliched, you do get confronted with what matters. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2391.48s)]
*  You know, and we've, you know, when it, you know, we've, I mean, we're just, we're very, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2399.96s)]
*  we've been thrust into this from really a very recognisable and ordinary lifestyle. You know, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2406.76s)]
*  we've got a mortgage and we've got, you know, and we depend on a, on a regular income to keep the [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2411.0s)]
*  wheels on the wagon, like, like, like, like everybody else, you know, the vast majority of people. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2415.1600000000003s)]
*  And, and so we, so we identify and have that commonality with, you know, that's why I think [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2420.44s)]
*  a lot of people, you know, write letters to me from all over the world and they, and they stop [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2426.44s)]
*  me in the street to talk to me because, you know, I think they instinctively realised that I'm not, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2430.36s)]
*  you know, a credentialed academic and I'm not an expert on this, that or the other. I'm very much [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2435.1600000000003s)]
*  just a regular person with, with the same, with all of the same concerns that they've got. Kids at [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2439.88s)]
*  school, you go, all of it, the, the, the people were, you know, were able to, were able to [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2446.44s)]
*  identify with. But when I say that I've been confronted with what really matters, you think [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2453.32s)]
*  all that stuff about, you know, whether you have, could afford us whatever, I don't know, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2459.0s)]
*  you know, a second home or, or, or luxury cars or all of that, all that cliched stuff that, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2463.8s)]
*  that people are encouraged to think about. And you think, God, no, what really, what really [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2468.44s)]
*  matters is spending 24 hours a day with somebody that backs you up. And my kids are the same, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2472.2s)]
*  you know, the kids were, they came through the whole, they were under pressure at the time to, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2479.24s)]
*  to take jobs, you know, you won't be able to go to the gym or you won't be able to go to, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2483.56s)]
*  you know, you won't be able to have your socialised and won't be able to travel. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2486.7599999999998s)]
*  And they were rattled by that. They were, you know, younger then, you know, they were teenagers [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2490.2799999999997s)]
*  when all of that happened, very, you know, impressionable and vulnerable, but, but we got [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2494.3599999999997s)]
*  them through that, but they didn't, you know, they didn't, they didn't, they, they ended up [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2497.88s)]
*  choosing not to take the, you know, take the jobs either. And I cannot put into words how much [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2502.36s)]
*  that means to me that they didn't get polluted with that product. That, that's it. That's [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2510.04s)]
*  everything to me. Nevermind the fact that Trudy and I didn't, the fact that it didn't go into them, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2517.0s)]
*  that there's not, there's no, there's no salary you could give me. There's no, you know, there's [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2523.08s)]
*  no bonus you could bung me that would, that would make any difference. So it's, it's all, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2528.04s)]
*  it's all of that. And so it's been, it's hard to talk about it in many ways without, you know, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2534.3599999999997s)]
*  without sounding almost like you're patronising people, but you know, the, the extent to which [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2539.3999999999996s)]
*  I've been reminded about what's important in life is worth, is worth all of it. You call me any name [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2545.8799999999997s)]
*  you want because I know who I am and you know, my family know who I am and I can look at my kids [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2553.08s)]
*  and my wife in the eye and she and mine and think no matter what, literally no matter what happens, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2560.2s)]
*  we, we made the right calls. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2567.7999999999997s)]
*  Soterios Johnson It does seem like obviously you're from a different, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2569.88s)]
*  slightly different culture than we're from here in the United States. You, it's a much smaller [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2574.36s)]
*  country. It's an island in the middle of a freezing sea and there does seem to be a greater [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2580.36s)]
*  level of conformity in the UK than there is the United States. And- [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2586.76s)]
*  Do you think so? Is that how it strikes you? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2590.28s)]
*  Soterios Johnson It does. I mean, it's a more obedient culture. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2592.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, you never had a wild west, you didn't have gunfights or you haven't, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2595.48s)]
*  you know, since Christianity showed up, et cetera. But it, it does seem, and I'm judging this from [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2598.76s)]
*  your media landscape. It seems like you and Russell Brand, maybe there's somebody, George [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2605.08s)]
*  Galloway, there don't seem to be many dissenters. Describe the media in the UK right now. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2608.92s)]
*  John Greenewald Oh my goodness. I have to be careful with my [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2615.48s)]
*  flowery language. Soterios Johnson [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2617.88s)]
*  Go crazy. John Greenewald [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2619.4s)]
*  Well, I'm appalled. I'm just simply appalled. The, we don't have anything that passes, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2620.44s)]
*  in the same way that we don't have any representation in parliament. We don't have [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2628.52s)]
*  any, we don't have any representation in the mainstream media. That was- [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2632.12s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Like at all, right? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2637.88s)]
*  John Greenewald That was another aspect of what was so [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2638.84s)]
*  unbelievable and so discombobulating and stressful about all of this. Because in the early weeks and [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2642.12s)]
*  months of what was going on from 2019, 2020 onwards, there was that period of waiting for [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2647.56s)]
*  the people, the silverbacks of the media world to stand up and do what was required to be done, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2652.92s)]
*  which was ask some questions. Don't, don't propagandize. Don't just give us the, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2659.32s)]
*  the government line and the, and the pharmaceutical line on all of this. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2665.88s)]
*  Soterios Johnson You stop lying. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2669.7200000000003s)]
*  John Greenewald Challenge it. Who's, so that incredible [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2670.6800000000003s)]
*  period of waiting and every single one of them failed the test. All the, all the mainstream [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2674.52s)]
*  channels, all the big titles, you know, the Telegraph, the Times, the Daily Mail, the works, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2681.08s)]
*  they all, they all swallowed it and pumped it back out again. So the media is, we don't have them. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2687.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, we don't have a media worth its name and journalism in Scotland, for example, had a proud, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2696.4399999999996s)]
*  proud, proud history of journalism. Dundee were truly studied to be a journalist. DC Thompson, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2703.24s)]
*  you know, an iconic publishing name in, in Scottish journalism. Duke Jam and journalism was the cry [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2709.0s)]
*  from Dundee and a proud, proud history of being ready to hold to the fire, the feet of those in [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2715.24s)]
*  authority and overnight either it had, either it had slipped away and we hadn't noticed it was only [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2722.2s)]
*  exposed by COVID or, or it, or it slipped away as soon as the COVID debacle started. And then, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2730.3599999999997s)]
*  and then realizing you're part of that process of casting around, looking for the card, we can't be [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2738.04s)]
*  the only people that think this is bonkers and bollocks. There must be other people like this. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2745.08s)]
*  And then that process of going online and as you say, Russell Brand, God bless him. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2750.04s)]
*  You know, he was already, he was an established podcaster. You know, he already was, he was already [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2754.2s)]
*  there doing other things. And when all this started, he was suddenly to the fore, you know, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2758.68s)]
*  asking those questions. Other things is an understatement. I mean, he was from a completely [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2764.2799999999997s)]
*  different world. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He had no incentive to get involved. But when it was, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2768.12s)]
*  when it was required, he was suddenly, he was there and we were watching, we were consuming [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2771.08s)]
*  Russell Brand as much of it as we could get. And we were watching you and we were watching [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2776.04s)]
*  George Galloway on the mother of all talk shows and the, you know, these funny things, these [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2780.6s)]
*  constellations, you know, all the other stars went out in the night sky and a few, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2786.52s)]
*  suddenly all these new constellations appeared and you're looking at, you're looking, thank God, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2790.44s)]
*  right? We can listen, who can we listen to today that, who may have many points of view that [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2794.7599999999998s)]
*  in other subjects and other concerns I might not agree with, but they're certainly asking some of [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2800.28s)]
*  the right questions about this. And, you know, so the new media stepped into the, stepped into the [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2805.5600000000004s)]
*  fray. And if anyone, and they are, people were surprised to see me, a guy that used to make [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2811.88s)]
*  documentaries about Stonehenge and the White Cliffs of Dover and, you know, in waterfalls and [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2819.6400000000003s)]
*  Purple Mountain Majesty and all of that. If they were surprised to see me suddenly, you know, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2825.0s)]
*  spotlight on a, on live television, asking questions about and refusing to comply with this, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2831.0s)]
*  that, and the next thing, if people were surprised to see me cast in that role, well, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2837.32s)]
*  not half as surprised as I was or Trudy was, you know, looking at me going, how did this happen [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2840.12s)]
*  to you? How have you ended up doing this? Well, that's a very good question. I really don't know, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2845.08s)]
*  but it's like the bit in the, it's like the bit in airplane, you know, where the pilot's [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2849.08s)]
*  dead with food poisoning and the co-pilot's dead and all the, and some, some, you know, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2852.36s)]
*  schmuck has to come from the back of the plane and sit, but because nobody else is going to do it. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2857.56s)]
*  You know, a lot of people were suddenly cast into that unlikely, into that unlikely role [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2861.48s)]
*  and have taken the dog's abuse for having done so. And their only crime has been to say, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2868.1200000000003s)]
*  hang on, I've got, I've got a question before we all leap into the abyss of [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2874.76s)]
*  all of this totalitarian regime. I'd quite like to ask a couple of questions just before we all go. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2882.28s)]
*  And, you know, and some of the hardest criticism has come from people that you [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2888.92s)]
*  would have thought ostensibly would have been on your side. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2891.96s)]
*  I mean, you live in a place where there are, I really don't think the American might, we often [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2895.48s)]
*  complain about our media, which is Stalinist, completely Stalinist. They serve the people in [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2899.48s)]
*  power. They'll tell any lie. It doesn't matter to them at all, but I think it's much worse [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2903.24s)]
*  in the UK. That's just my observation. I mean, I did watch some of your guys, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2908.52s)]
*  you know, eating hamburgers and saying, you get a free one of these if you get your job and, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2912.2s)]
*  Oh, it was totalitarian. And dancing alongside, you know, you know, people dressed up as hypodermic [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2917.0s)]
*  needles. And I know, I mean, I remember all of that, but so, so yes, it's, it's, but it doesn't [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2922.2s)]
*  seem like any dissent is allowed in your country. For example, tell us about the Scottish [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2927.9599999999996s)]
*  hate speech law. Oh, well that I would say that's part and parcel of something that seems to be [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2932.92s)]
*  happening around the world in a certain kind of Western country, which is to say either [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2938.84s)]
*  small countries with small populations or quite large land masses, but small populations. So, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2946.12s)]
*  you know, Canada, Australia, but places like New Zealand, the English sphere, the English speaking [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2950.76s)]
*  world, but then, but then something's equally sinister also happened in Israel. You know, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2956.28s)]
*  where Netanyahu said, make my people the petri dish of the world, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2961.56s)]
*  experiment on these here lab rats. So again, a small, a small population with, with a, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2966.36s)]
*  with an authoritarian leader that just offhand just decided to do what he wanted, but that was [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2972.7599999999998s)]
*  true of all of them. So, and yes, Britain, but then Scotland obviously has a devolved [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2977.24s)]
*  a administration based in Edinburgh empowered, empowered to do, to take a certain amount of [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2982.84s)]
*  decisions separate from Westminster in London. And we've been under the thrall of, of a, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2991.6400000000003s)]
*  of an administration in Edinburgh led by the Scottish national party for what seems like a [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=2999.32s)]
*  thousand years. It's been like an SNP Reich. It doesn't seem very Scottish to me at all. Well, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3005.0s)]
*  I got, I first got into, I first put my head above the parapet and got into trouble as a, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3012.3599999999997s)]
*  as a contrarian all the way back in 2014, actually, because that was the time of the referendum on [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3017.8799999999997s)]
*  whether or not Scotland would remain part of the United Kingdom or would strike out as a, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3025.48s)]
*  as a, as a separate entity. And God forgive me, I had kind of been keeping out of it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3029.3999999999996s)]
*  I was just, I had my opinions, but I was keeping out of it relatively late in the day, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3035.9599999999996s)]
*  coming up to the vote. I think it was the Telegraph, but one of the big broadsheet [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3040.36s)]
*  newspapers asked me for, what do you think? Would you write us, you know, a thousand words [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3045.56s)]
*  about what you think? And I wrote that, well, to cut a long story short, that I'd prefer to [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3050.1200000000003s)]
*  stay part of the United Kingdom. Cue the, a probrium from the nationalists, those who, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3054.52s)]
*  and, and, and because of it, I had made television like the history of Scotland and I had been seen [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3062.36s)]
*  as a certain kind of Scottish TV presenter. I think a lot of people made the broad assumption [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3066.68s)]
*  that I was probably nationalist in my politics, which I never have been and, and, you know, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3070.44s)]
*  never will be. But, but, but none of that. So I got, I got into, I got into trouble then. And so [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3076.2s)]
*  I've been on the, I've been under attack from the SNP and its little wizards ever since then. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3082.68s)]
*  So I have, it's, it's, it's important probably in the context of this conversation to make [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3091.56s)]
*  plain that it actually wasn't COVID that I first got into trouble. It was, it was the independence [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3095.56s)]
*  referendum. And so Scotland is run by, by low caliber people, low caliber cacostocracy, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3100.52s)]
*  you know, government by the worst of people. And, you know, the, the SNP started, you know, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3113.24s)]
*  started out famously, well, not, it didn't start out, but at the time of the referendum, it was [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3118.36s)]
*  led by Alex Salmond, who at least was a, you know, he was an able, sure-footed politician [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3122.76s)]
*  and a good auditor. You know, so he had some, he had some game, but subsequently it's been [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3129.5600000000004s)]
*  Nicholas Sturgeon and it was Nicholas, then more recently Hamza Youssef and now he's fallen on his, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3135.88s)]
*  fallen over his own feet and he's been replaced by another one, another, you know, another [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3141.7200000000003s)]
*  nonentity, but it was Nicholas Sturgeon through the, through the COVID debacle. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3146.6s)]
*  And they just seemed to, they reveled in, she reveled in the power and she reveled in, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3151.72s)]
*  you know, appearing every day to count death tolls and insist on the continuation of lockdown and [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3157.08s)]
*  cutting the six inches off the bottoms of doors in school classrooms to let air circulate. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3162.7599999999998s)]
*  And insane. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3167.88s)]
*  Is she a pretty smart, happy, well-balanced person? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3169.56s)]
*  I would say no, no, no. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3172.52s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3173.7999999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3177.3999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3178.04s)]
*  No. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3178.52s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3178.68s)]
*  No. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3179.16s)]
*  So you have in the SNP in Scotland, people who are drunk with the idea of power, you know, they [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3180.7599999999998s)]
*  really, I mean, the very idea that the people, that a majority would have, would have put that [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3188.3599999999997s)]
*  bunch actually in control of an independent country makes my blood run cold because it was [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3192.2799999999997s)]
*  a close run thing for a while, but it's gone now. The threat's gone for a generation, if not forever. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3195.8799999999997s)]
*  But so they're inept, they're cacastocratic. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3204.04s)]
*  And when it came to the hate crime legislation, they just seem to go for one offensive, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3210.4399999999996s)]
*  irritating policy after another. They attempted a named persons bill in recent history where they [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3219.72s)]
*  were trying to insinuate between every child and their parents, a named person. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3227.08s)]
*  That could be a teacher, it could be any figure. That person would have been encouraged and the [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3233.64s)]
*  child would have been encouraged to establish a relationship with that named person. If there are [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3240.52s)]
*  things you don't want to talk to mum and dad about, you could talk to this named person. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3244.92s)]
*  And your parents would never need to know that those conversations had taken place. This was [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3249.72s)]
*  the named persons bill. It was eventually knocked back at the Supreme Court. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3254.52s)]
*  But this is an attempt to destroy the family. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3258.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's would certainly be, that was my interpretation of it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3260.2s)]
*  What's the other interpretation? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3263.48s)]
*  Well, it was supposed to be... [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3264.6s)]
*  The government has more authority in your home than you do. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3266.28s)]
*  It's the same reason for clamping down on the internet. It's for the safety of children. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3269.0s)]
*  That's what they always say. It's about protecting children from this, that and the other. And of [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3274.04s)]
*  course we know it's got nothing to do with that. It's just about taking control of the internet. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3277.24s)]
*  So the Named Persons Act was... Yes, but in line with that idea of if you want to lead a popular [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3280.68s)]
*  movement, you have to separate the children from their parents. You've got to put pressure [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3286.7599999999998s)]
*  on the family until the family fractures. It took the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3290.36s)]
*  to finally turn back and stop the named persons bill. But it'll be in someone's drawer somewhere. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3295.72s)]
*  Still under consideration. The hate crime legislation was just... So it's important [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3304.12s)]
*  not to come in on the SNP and the third act, so to speak. We've got a long history of this [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3309.16s)]
*  kind of behavior. And when it came to the hate crime legislation, that was a pet project of [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3313.08s)]
*  Hamza Yousaf, who was the sometime justice minister. He always failed in every post but fell [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3319.96s)]
*  upwards. So he was justice and failed and got promoted up to health and failed and was promoted [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3325.3999999999996s)]
*  up to whatever, one inappropriate appointment after another. And the hate crime legislation [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3331.3199999999997s)]
*  was very much something that he championed. And what was it? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3338.12s)]
*  Well, you see this manifestation of it in Canada. Trudeau has brought in similar legislation. I [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3342.04s)]
*  don't know if it's called the hate crime. It's almost the same name, but you see it all over. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3349.08s)]
*  The same thing is happening in Australia. The attempt by these would be these tin pot dictatorial [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3354.92s)]
*  politicians to have control of what people say and what people think. Hamza Yousaf wanted to [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3361.88s)]
*  criminalize what people were saying in the privacy of their own homes. So the idea was that if mom [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3368.12s)]
*  and dad were having a conversation in front of the television one evening and dad said something, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3373.2400000000002s)]
*  if the child inadvertently repeated it in school the next day, let's say, my dad said so and so, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3379.16s)]
*  the police could come to the house hypothetically and say to the father, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3386.52s)]
*  what was that you were saying in this house last night? We've got your child's, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3393.32s)]
*  that was the level of it. So is Hamza, I mean, that's totally North Korean. I don't even think [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3397.7999999999997s)]
*  that happens in North Korea actually. He's gone now. But is he considered, I mean, he should be [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3402.04s)]
*  expelled from your country for doing that in my opinion, but is he considered a villain? I mean, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3407.08s)]
*  how could he? It's so evil. Yes. Yes. You would think that any rational person would respond to [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3412.52s)]
*  that kind of notion in the same way, but look at the way it's happening all over. It's not just [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3419.08s)]
*  happening in Scotland. It's happening all over. It's part of a pattern of behavior of a certain [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3422.36s)]
*  kind of controlled leader in one Western country after another who are demonstrably working from [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3428.68s)]
*  the same script. It's no coincidence that all of these Western regimes in these countries are [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3437.4s)]
*  taking similar steps at the same time. They're not acting independently of one another. They're not [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3446.12s)]
*  all having these dreadful ideas independently at the same time. This stuff is part of the same [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3452.04s)]
*  pattern that we saw during lockdown where suddenly it was everyone was saying build back better. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3458.76s)]
*  Everyone was saying narrow window of opportunity. Everyone was saying safe and effective, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3463.08s)]
*  clearly centralized scripts. It was a pandemic of the unvaccinated. I think we can agree on that. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3468.28s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. That was a favorite. But what is that? What are we looking at? Who's coming up [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3472.6s)]
*  with these ideas, these talking points? What's the point of it all? I don't want to be a conspiracy [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3478.68s)]
*  nut, but the level of coordination suggests that there is some sort of body atop all of this [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3485.16s)]
*  controlling everything. What else does it suggest? It feels as though, I think it's getting harder and [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3493.96s)]
*  harder to overlook what seems like the certainty that we're on the cusp of change, a paradigm [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3499.64s)]
*  change. I would say that we're being herded towards feudalism. Most people, for most of [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3509.32s)]
*  5,000 years of human history, most people pretty much live in serfdom. In a feudal state, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3520.04s)]
*  you can describe it any way you like, but it's a narrow, very, very small group at the top with [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3529.8s)]
*  everything, with all the castles, ownership of everything. Everyone else is so far beneath them [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3534.52s)]
*  as to be at insect level and treated accordingly. That is what we're going back to. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3541.32s)]
*  Really up until the 19th century. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3548.7599999999998s)]
*  It was the way of it for everyone everywhere. The kind of way of life that has been possible [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3551.24s)]
*  for some of us, a relative handful in the scheme of things, a blinking of an eye in the great story [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3557.08s)]
*  of human civilization, a tiny, tiny lucky group for a couple of hundred years in the West were [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3563.08s)]
*  able to live lives of unbelievable liberty and opportunity and equality and aspiration. If you [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3570.04s)]
*  wanted to, you could get whatever you were capable of achieving for yourself. Enough generations have [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3578.68s)]
*  taken that for granted that now it has fallen. People think that food in the supermarkets [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3586.6s)]
*  lights on in the dark, police on the street actually care about the people rather than [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3596.7599999999998s)]
*  being enforcers for the establishment. They think there's been a misconception that somehow [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3601.96s)]
*  it's just in the natural order of things, that society works like that. Just the merest glance [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3606.2s)]
*  at the rest of the world at the moment, never mind 5,000 years of history, will show that the [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3612.84s)]
*  possibility of living the kind of lives that some of us have been able to live for a very brief [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3617.6400000000003s)]
*  period of time is vanishingly, it's impossibly unlikely what we've had. But too many people have [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3621.56s)]
*  finally been taking it for granted one after another. Now those who would return us to feudalism [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3628.44s)]
*  have seen, saw the opportunity and have been working towards it. And populations all over the [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3637.16s)]
*  West taking it for granted, being tolerant, being nice, keeping their heads down in return for safety [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3644.68s)]
*  and convenience have laid themselves open. They're not in a fit state to defend themselves against a [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3652.92s)]
*  well-organised, well-motivated small group that wants to return the whole thing to some sort of [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3661.64s)]
*  some sort of neo-feudalism. But I mean, that's not to say it's too late. You know, I don't want to be [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3666.36s)]
*  I don't want to be completely negative here. That I do think it's still possible. I think enough [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3673.0s)]
*  people have realised, are realising all the time. And I would say, I think... [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3679.2400000000002s)]
*  Wait, may I assess one thing? So are you suggesting, it sounds like you are and you probably are right, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3684.6800000000003s)]
*  but that some kind of feudalism is the natural state of man? Radically hierarchical societies [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3688.84s)]
*  are just natural. Yes, yes, absolutely. People enslaved, you know, slavery is a, you know, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3694.52s)]
*  is a natural state. Of course. It just is. You know, it's been a reality for so many, for such [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3701.4s)]
*  a large part of everyone who's ever lived or died. Well, of course. Through history. But I think, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3709.96s)]
*  you know, when, when in 2016, you know, when we had Trump elected here and Britain voted Brexit, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3716.52s)]
*  subsequent to that, we got Covid and goodness knows what all. Trudy said, perhaps she wasn't [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3729.48s)]
*  alone, but she was the person that I heard say it. She said, those two things were not supposed to [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3737.8799999999997s)]
*  happen. They were not in the script. Somebody took their eye off the ball and allowed a figure [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3743.72s)]
*  like Donald Trump to be elected in America. That's right. And for the population of Britain, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3750.04s)]
*  by a narrow margin, but nonetheless, by a majority to leave the European Union. And Trudy said, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3754.12s)]
*  everything we've had since has been a sustained punishment beating to put those populations back [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3759.56s)]
*  in their box. So everything that's happened, including the evaporation of your southern border, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3765.3999999999996s)]
*  all of that, all of that that's happened has been a panicky response by that, by a narrow group [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3772.2s)]
*  that saw two things happening off script that were of great significance because it was democratic. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3781.64s)]
*  You know, that those were popular votes and now populism is being stamped on all over the, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3787.7999999999997s)]
*  all over the world, the tractors, the truckers revolt, the farmers protests all across Europe. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3794.2s)]
*  All of these things are being mischaracterized by the authorities as far right as extremists, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3798.68s)]
*  you know, all of the same, all of the same labels. Because in both cases, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3803.96s)]
*  the people didn't get what they voted for. I mean, Trump was not able to govern. No, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3807.3199999999997s)]
*  very effectively. It couldn't build the wall that he promised was investigated and spied on from, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3811.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, the very first day. And I don't think you guys got Brexit. You voted for Brexit, right? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3818.2s)]
*  Absolutely. 52%. I think it was 52. Yeah. 52 to 48% in favour of leaving the European Union. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3823.3199999999997s)]
*  And from the moment the ink dried on that decision, all of the powers that be in the [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3830.04s)]
*  establishment, in the civil service, all of it across the political parties, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3837.08s)]
*  moved heaven and earth to thwart that decision. And so it's been Brexit in name only, Brino, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3842.52s)]
*  that they've called it because it's now worse. I would say that the situation for those people [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3851.4s)]
*  that aspired to Brexit, they've got less now than they had before the vote happened because they've [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3857.7200000000003s)]
*  been so comprehensively punished and Brexit has been so eviscerated. The very concept of it has [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3864.84s)]
*  been so hollowed out that the people that wanted it have got less than nothing from it because it [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3870.84s)]
*  was populist. And notice also that in the last four or five years populist has become a pejorative. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3876.76s)]
*  How can people use the word democracy to describe your country? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3883.32s)]
*  Well, we don't. That's why I have these fundamental problems about, we certainly [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3886.36s)]
*  don't have democracy. I wonder when democracy went away. I wonder for how long it's been standing. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3890.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, what's your guess? I really, gosh, I mean, in my most [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3897.32s)]
*  conspiratorial moments, I think something began to happen all across the West [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3903.88s)]
*  after the second world war. Clearly. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3911.1600000000003s)]
*  Really from the middle, during the war and after the war, I think the moves, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3914.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know if it started then, but I think there was a gear shift. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3921.7200000000003s)]
*  Have you been to Tokyo? Have you been to Japan? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3924.76s)]
*  I have filmed in Tokyo. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3926.76s)]
*  So then you sort of wonder when you go to Japan, if you go from London to Tokyo, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3928.84s)]
*  there's no evidence that the side that won actually won and the side that lost actually lost. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3934.6000000000004s)]
*  If you didn't know the history, you would think, well, obviously Japan won the war. Look at it. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3941.4s)]
*  Obviously England lost it. Look at England. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3945.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3949.0s)]
*  What is that? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3949.48s)]
*  Yes. I mean, there are all sorts of things that are confusing. I'm not a historian. I love history. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3950.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm fascinated by history. My shelves are full of history books. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3954.84s)]
*  So how many books have you written? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3959.7200000000003s)]
*  Written? Oh, 12 or 13. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3962.2s)]
*  I think it's fair to call you a historian. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3966.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, but I'm not an academic. I don't have any. Nor do I want to be. I never really have [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3968.2799999999997s)]
*  had that. It's not in my nature. I'm not really... Anyway, so it means that I'm prepared. I'm [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3973.3999999999996s)]
*  perfectly happy to be at home to unorthodox ideas about history because I don't have any [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3979.9599999999996s)]
*  academic... I don't have a professorship to defend. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3987.4799999999996s)]
*  Maybe that's why you can see the world clearly. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3990.2s)]
*  And I sometimes wonder if I have a unique, a USP, a unique selling point. I think it may be that [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3991.96s)]
*  the things that I have said over the last few years, everyone knows they're true. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=3998.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4006.2s)]
*  It's just that for whatever reason, I've said them and I've had the opportunity and the platform [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4007.8799999999997s)]
*  from which to say them. And because I am just a regular person saying what every other regular [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4015.4s)]
*  person knows is true, that's my... But we've wandered off... [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4023.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that's a great... You're qualified enough. You're not an Oxford Don, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4030.76s)]
*  but you've been right about a lot of things. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4034.2000000000003s)]
*  So I've got basic questions about the Second World War. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4035.8s)]
*  Okay. Well, what are they? Like clearly something important changed in the West in 1945. What was [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4037.88s)]
*  very interesting to me is that Hitler and Stalin were together at the beginning of it. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4044.04s)]
*  And when Poland was invaded, Britain said, we will do whatever it takes to restore [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4052.2799999999997s)]
*  freedom and democracy to the people from whom it's been denied, stolen. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4058.7599999999998s)]
*  And then what happened, Neil Oliver? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4063.9599999999996s)]
*  And then you've only got to read any coverage of the Second World War to know that at the end [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4065.9599999999996s)]
*  of the Second World War, Poland was left swallowed whole by... [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4073.48s)]
*  Well, they handed it to Stalin. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4078.36s)]
*  So the stated objective... [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4080.36s)]
*  What is that? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4082.84s)]
*  The stated objective of Britain declaring war at the time was, well, you didn't do it. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4083.64s)]
*  You didn't do that. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4090.68s)]
*  Well, you didn't even try. And in our country, it's illegal to criticize Winston Churchill. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4092.12s)]
*  He's the greatest hero in world history. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4096.68s)]
*  And when you look at the murkiness that happened at Yalta, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4100.12s)]
*  you know, between Roosevelt and Stalin and Churchill and the fact that, you know, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4103.879999999999s)]
*  agreements were arrived at somehow where many people who wanted whatever you would call West, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4111.639999999999s)]
*  the West, they wanted to be the West. They were just allowed to be swallowed whole by [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4120.12s)]
*  the communist bloc. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4125.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, to the most violent totalitarian in history. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4127.719999999999s)]
*  So they handed these countries, they went to war to protect the sovereignty of these countries [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4130.76s)]
*  that they then handed. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4136.04s)]
*  And people were being chased back across specified lines back into the arms of... [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4137.0s)]
*  So what is that? Clearly, clearly there's lying here. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4141.64s)]
*  So what's the truth? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4145.08s)]
*  So we started there because we were speculating about when they all started to go wrong, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4145.72s)]
*  when the slide towards, you know, neo... [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4153.400000000001s)]
*  Anything that ends in ism is the same. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4156.2s)]
*  You know, whether it's fascism or communism or any of these things end up with piles of [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4159.0s)]
*  corpses. You can't get a cigarette paper between these, between any of these ideologies. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4163.88s)]
*  So it's important not to be distracted by whether or not it's national socialism or [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4168.5199999999995s)]
*  communism or whatever. They're all the same. They're good for a handful of people and they're [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4172.679999999999s)]
*  catastrophic for everybody else. And so clearly, clearly something shifted up a gear in the West, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4177.0s)]
*  in the middle of the... [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4185.8s)]
*  In the during the second world war and after, and has been moving faster and faster ever since. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4187.400000000001s)]
*  And I think there's been an extraordinary gamble taken now because even people who were in a [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4195.8s)]
*  state of semi slumber like myself were aware of notions like a social contract. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4208.68s)]
*  You know, that I was, that we as citizens would be represent, you know, no taxation without [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4215.400000000001s)]
*  representation. You know, we would be, we would have our views represented. We would have our [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4223.88s)]
*  liberty defended. We would be, we would be, we would be safe in peaceful countries. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4229.24s)]
*  And in return for that, we would pay tax and we would submit to certain otherwise, you know, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4236.360000000001s)]
*  onerous restrictions on you can't do anything. You've got to be agreed to be policed by consent [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4241.56s)]
*  and so on and so on. And that's okay. So there's no social contract. There's a quid pro quo there [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4247.160000000001s)]
*  for people. There's a reason for people to comply because there's something in it for them. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4253.8s)]
*  Liberty, aspiration, hope, all of that being protected by legislation and a constitution [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4259.240000000001s)]
*  and all of that. The gamble that's been taken now is that all of that is supposed to, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4267.16s)]
*  is being taken away. Everything that the people, all of the inducements to be law-abiding, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4272.68s)]
*  peaceful citizens is being taken away. And what do I get in return? Nothing. You're going to get [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4280.92s)]
*  a digital ID. You're going to get central bank, digital currencies. You're going to live in 15 [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4289.08s)]
*  minute cities. You know, you're going to have your, we'll tell you what to eat. Your currency [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4293.56s)]
*  will be programmable. So we'll have complete moment to moment in real time control of everything [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4298.200000000001s)]
*  you do, everything you want to do. Now that's a heck of a gamble for a very narrow group of [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4302.92s)]
*  people to take with billions of people because there's nothing in it for the people. There's [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4311.160000000001s)]
*  nothing in it for them. And I think, I think they have fumbled to the ball. I think that's [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4317.08s)]
*  where there's hope because not 50%, not 51% of the people have realized that and would do anything [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4324.2s)]
*  about it, but history shows that it never, it never requires, it only takes 5% or 10% of people [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4331.64s)]
*  to cotton on and do something about it and make the difference. And I think that on the, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4338.2s)]
*  in the final moves towards this kind of neo-feudalism, they have exposed themselves. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4342.84s)]
*  They've gone galloping towards the finishing line too early in the wrong way. And too many [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4349.320000000001s)]
*  people have seen it. And I think in there somewhere is hope and it's probably enough hope. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4355.72s)]
*  I wonder though, I mean, it does seem two things. It seems like they're pushing the population, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4362.84s)]
*  not just of your country or mine, but really of most Western countries, right to the point [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4368.44s)]
*  of revolution. Like how about we give you nothing and you shut up and take it. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4373.4s)]
*  Yeah. And erase all hope for a future for your children or grandchildren, even having children [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4379.48s)]
*  or grandchildren. It's quite a gamble to take. But the gamble is that the technology is evolving [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4385.48s)]
*  so quickly that it'll allow them to harness, you know, the surveillance state and various [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4393.24s)]
*  tools of violence that are so overwhelming that there's nothing the population can do anything, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4400.36s)]
*  could do about it. You know, drones and AI are going to be enough to sort of force people to [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4404.679999999999s)]
*  accept this. That's how I read it. It's possible. Yes, of course it's possible, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4409.08s)]
*  but I think it's incumbent upon us to be optimistic that that's not what happens. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4413.719999999999s)]
*  You know, I think there's an absolute obligation. It's beyond a right. It's an absolute obligation [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4420.200000000001s)]
*  to be positive. I struggle with it. I mean, I have to be yanked back onto the path of righteousness [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4428.200000000001s)]
*  by Trudy all the time because she is by inclination more positive than I am. But nonetheless, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4433.72s)]
*  you know, I lean to the dark side all the time. Well, Scots have dark souls, don't they? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4439.64s)]
*  Yes, we are. It's never difficult to tell the difference between a Scotsman and an array of [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4444.04s)]
*  sunshine as the saying goes. But you have to, it's, when we spoke earlier about being brought to [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4448.6s)]
*  terms with being made to confront what really matters, and it is difficult to talk about it [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4461.400000000001s)]
*  in many ways. It almost makes a person blush because of the things that you find yourself [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4468.280000000001s)]
*  having to say. But, you know, the Constitution of the United States, you know, the First Amendment, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4473.88s)]
*  at times like this that these things are suddenly, a light comes on inside them and suddenly everyone [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4481.639999999999s)]
*  sees them as though for the first time. It's only because they're being threatened that people see [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4488.04s)]
*  them. You know, the language, you know, the inalienable right is so important, you know, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4495.96s)]
*  that you know this, you get this at school, but, you know, the inalienable is to say that your [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4504.52s)]
*  freedom is not, you're born with it. It's there, it's from God. It certainly isn't given to you [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4510.44s)]
*  by any person and it can't be taken from you by any person. But the third and most important bit [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4517.4s)]
*  about inalienable I only really began to contemplate in recent years is that even if you [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4523.56s)]
*  want to surrender your freedom, you can't because it's inalienable. You are lumbered with it. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4527.72s)]
*  You're stuck with it. It's like your leg. You can't, it's part of you, your freedom. And it's when [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4535.88s)]
*  it's challenged in this way and it's under freedom and people talk about freedoms as though it's [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4542.6s)]
*  plural. There's only freedom. It's a single thing. And because it's inalienable, it's at the moment [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4547.88s)]
*  when it's being threatened that people, none of us has any, we have an obligation to defend it. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4554.360000000001s)]
*  You don't get the choice. If someone offers you slavery, will you be my slave? You can't [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4560.6s)]
*  because it's your inalienable right to be free. You can't surrender to slavery. It's not your [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4566.92s)]
*  thing to give away. And that's why some of this, I suppose, had to happen. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4573.96s)]
*  People need to see the freedom of speech being taken away by hate crime legislation, hate speech [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4581.56s)]
*  legislation or whatever. They need these things to happen before you look again at what freedom is, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4587.8s)]
*  what democracy might be, what it is to have inalienable rights. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4595.88s)]
*  We don't have the option to give these things up even if we're broken and we want to. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4604.36s)]
*  I think these are profound verities. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4612.68s)]
*  . What's the tipping point? What's the point at which you won't have optimism? [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4614.5199999999995s)]
*  What's the point at which? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4619.48s)]
*  Never. You can't. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4620.5199999999995s)]
*  Good. Well, good. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4621.72s)]
*  Well, you can't because that's what I mean. Because you're not, it's not, you're not allowed. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4622.5199999999995s)]
*  You're not entitled to give up because it's in the nature of inalienable rights. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4629.0s)]
*  You even if unto death, you know, they can, you know, we'll get, you know, you may take our lives, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4635.4s)]
*  but you'll never take our freedom. You know, the oft quoted line from Braveheart. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4641.48s)]
*  That is just it. So there's nothing to be pessimistic about essentially because the [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4646.12s)]
*  option to give up is not there. You don't get to give it up. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4650.68s)]
*  Do you think that totalitarians will win on? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4655.72s)]
*  No, no, they won't because, because I believe I also think a lot nowadays about natural law. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4657.8s)]
*  You know, I read about common law, which has become an obsession. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4664.200000000001s)]
*  And I read about natural law and whether you're religious or not, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4668.52s)]
*  if you, let's say you just, if you accept an intelligent universe, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4674.5199999999995s)]
*  and then natural law says that the intelligent universe does want the best for you. Unlike our [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4680.44s)]
*  regimes and our establishments and our powers that be the universe is there for you to be the [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4687.96s)]
*  the best expression of yourself and consciousness that can be. And all of that can be subverted [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4695.96s)]
*  by evil. It a bit like a, if you can hold a ball under the surface of water for as long as you've [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4705.08s)]
*  got the strength to do it, but the ball wants to be somewhere else because that's the, that's in [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4712.76s)]
*  the natural order of things. And eventually the totalitarians will run out of the strength [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4718.12s)]
*  to subvert the, the way that things are supposed to be. And you can't, it's difficult to put a [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4724.76s)]
*  timeline on these things. You know, I wouldn't say that we're going to see the end of it in our [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4731.88s)]
*  lifetimes, you and me, and it might be for our children to see the end of it, but it will end [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4736.36s)]
*  and the, because the natural law will reassert itself. I didn't, I didn't, another of the things [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4742.68s)]
*  I was sort of sleepy about in a state of slumber about, I didn't really think about faith. I've [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4751.16s)]
*  always been a person of faith quietly. I don't go to church, but I believe in a, in a transcendent [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4758.599999999999s)]
*  intelligent entity. And I think that was brought home to me and the light came on in it for me [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4767.72s)]
*  during this time as well, because so many people wrote to me, thousands of people wrote to me from [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4777.4s)]
*  all over the world. This game started where people, one woman wrote a letter to me and addressed it to [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4782.04s)]
*  Neil Oliver near Stirling Castle, Stirling, Scotland. And the letter came to me and I thought, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4787.879999999999s)]
*  well, that's impressive. The postman managed to get that to me. And I put a picture of it on social [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4794.36s)]
*  media and without thinking, and it opened floodgates. And now I've had thousands of letters [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4798.5199999999995s)]
*  like these. And so people were writing to me without knowing my address. And the vast majority [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4803.32s)]
*  of the letters were about, this is a fight between good and evil. This is a fight between right and [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4808.2s)]
*  wrong. This is about light and dark. It was, it was that, it was as fundamental as that for, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4812.84s)]
*  for most of those people that were writing to me and perversely, you know, in an upside down way, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4820.12s)]
*  it was becoming aware of evil in the world around me that made me think there will be, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4826.28s)]
*  what's the opposite of evil? There must be good. There must be good because I see the evil [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4833.72s)]
*  and every, you know, every force has its equal and opposite. So there must be good. There must [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4840.5199999999995s)]
*  be God or there must be, because I've seen the alternative. I've seen the adversary because it's [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4847.32s)]
*  it's stalking the land at the moment. The badness is visible. And that was, you know, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4855.08s)]
*  that's part of the, the profound realignment that I've been going through. Or it really is [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4861.639999999999s)]
*  just an awakening. I mean, that's how that's a hackneyed term now, but being awakened. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4865.96s)]
*  Do you see it happening to others around you? Yes. Yes, absolutely. More and more, more and more [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4870.44s)]
*  people are saying it and it doesn't, you know, differences are never made by the majority. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4875.16s)]
*  Not really. That's not how it works. You know, the, the, the, the crucial thing is invariably [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4881.8s)]
*  done by the one or just a few people who are right. You know, when, you know, when you, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4887.96s)]
*  when you, sometimes you'll be sitting at a dinner table with friends and family and whatever, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4896.360000000001s)]
*  and you see something and the whole place just breaks up a great, perfect line. You just say [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4901.320000000001s)]
*  something and everyone laughs. And if you think often, most often you didn't, you didn't even [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4907.32s)]
*  think of the line. You didn't compose it. It's just there and you said it and everyone laughs [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4914.44s)]
*  because what you said in, it's not just funny. It's also true, right? People can instantly, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4920.759999999999s)]
*  true runs through people, you know, like lightning through a lightning conductor. It just, oh, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4929.0s)]
*  it runs through you and you feel it. And that, I think that's what's happened for a lot of people. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4933.32s)]
*  A lot of people are able to identify very readily with, with what's wrong here, which is simply an [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4940.2s)]
*  inversion of natural law that, that evil has, is trying to assert itself. Freedom is being taken [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4946.12s)]
*  from people from whom it cannot be taken, but with, but with the ending of those people themselves, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4953.0s)]
*  these fundamentals are happening. And I do genuinely hand on heart thinking of people think that [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4959.8s)]
*  don't just think it, they know it because it's true. It's, it's true. And people feel it. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4965.16s)]
*  It's a, I think what you're saying is absolutely right. True things are, they resonate. There's [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4973.8s)]
*  like a tuning fork inside you that starts to hum when you hear something that you know to be true. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4979.0s)]
*  It almost doesn't need to be explained. So when you hear it, you know it. But I think there's a [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4984.76s)]
*  step from that experience to using the word God in public in the, in the secular West. Are you hearing [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4989.320000000001s)]
*  that more? Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And, and I feel good about it. And, and I think part of why [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=4995.0s)]
*  I feel good about it is because it's, it's coming at me in various shades. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5002.360000000001s)]
*  being, you know, people of Christian and, and Islamic faith are talking to me. And up there and [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5007.48s)]
*  inter alia, they're, they're, they mentioned, they talk about everything, but they talk about [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5017.0s)]
*  faith and good and evil. And I hear within the, within the Christian community, I hear from [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5021.16s)]
*  Catholic and Protestant and, and they're all saying the same thing because the, the, the, the only [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5026.04s)]
*  important bits of any of those messages are the same anyway. And they're all, they're all, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5033.88s)]
*  again, it's the truth. So it's, it's, it's striking. It's chiming with me. It's, I can, you know, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5042.2s)]
*  I can feel it because it's evidently true. And so I don't, I don't have any, I don't have any quam [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5047.8s)]
*  about invoking God because, you know, I'm pretty sure I've caught sight of the devil. It's so [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5052.52s)]
*  interesting. Like everything, not everything, but a lot of things that I thought 20 years ago are [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5060.2s)]
*  completely ridiculous. Now I was utterly wrong. And one of them, we were told for so long that [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5064.84s)]
*  Muslims are your enemy. And I want to say I'm not a Muslim and I'm completely opposed to mass [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5070.36s)]
*  migration period. I don't care of anybody. I'm just against it, but it hasn't turned out that way. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5075.639999999999s)]
*  And I have to say you Galloway, of course, Russell Brand, it feels like the people who hate you the [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5081.4s)]
*  most in the UK are educated white liberals. And it feels like a lot of Muslim immigrants are [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5089.56s)]
*  open to what you're saying and agree with you. That's my impression as a foreigner. Do you feel [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5097.64s)]
*  that? Yes, yes. They are, because I, you know, I think it's often, it's much more important just [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5101.080000000001s)]
*  to see a person first. Of course that's true. I know you know that, but that's, that's the thing. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5106.280000000001s)]
*  And so I don't, I don't always think about this information is coming at me from a Christian or [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5110.92s)]
*  from a Muslim. Well, in our country, I mean, it's a different experience, but after 9-11, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5115.0s)]
*  I'm not, again, I'm not Muslim, not going to become Muslim. I don't agree with Islam, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5119.56s)]
*  but we were told again and again, and everybody in the world that I lived in [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5123.400000000001s)]
*  seemed to agree with it that Muslims is Islam. That's our enemy. I don't know if you had that [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5128.200000000001s)]
*  experience in the UK. We definitely had that here and it's just interesting. But again, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5134.280000000001s)]
*  that's, that's all part of that divide and conquer. You're absolutely right. I just did not perceive [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5139.080000000001s)]
*  that at the time because I mean, well, you've made me think about it. You know, you, you spent [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5143.4800000000005s)]
*  years in, in Washington, DC, only 35, not a big deal. You see, I'm, I, I hold my hand up and say, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5148.2s)]
*  I absolutely, I grew up with absolute certainty that America were the good guys. I watched the [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5157.08s)]
*  West wing, almost all of it. And I thought that, you know, as long as there's Democrats in the, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5162.84s)]
*  in the West wing, you know, the, the white-hatted cowboys are out there making sure everything's [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5168.36s)]
*  going to be good. God help me. You know that I went, I went, Oh, Jed Bartlett. Whoa, fantastic. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5174.12s)]
*  And now I think, Oh, how, why did I ever, why did I ever think that? Now you were in the belly of [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5179.96s)]
*  the beast. What is it? What, what is it with these people? You know, these people that, you know, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5189.0s)]
*  that I'm not going to, why name any names? You know, these people that have gone in skinny and [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5193.72s)]
*  come out fat with money, with lobbying and goodness and insider trading and all of the rest of it. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5197.4s)]
*  So they've got more money than creases and they're still there in the dotage, still at [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5203.96s)]
*  what drives it. What makes these I miss, I miss the whole thing. I didn't grow up worrying about [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5211.32s)]
*  money and just being as honest as I can be. So I never really thought of money as a huge motivator [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5218.6s)]
*  in people's behavior because it never was for me. What's motivating these people? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5223.56s)]
*  Clearly money is part of it. I, I was just late to that understanding. You know, we all have [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5227.56s)]
*  blind spots and failures and that was definitely one of mine. I just didn't, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5232.28s)]
*  I didn't see how corrupt it was because I couldn't imagine, like I would never say something I, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5236.2s)]
*  I don't believe for money. I just would never do that. It would never even occur to me to do that. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5241.96s)]
*  So, um, I didn't grow up like that. So the idea that other people were saying things they knew [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5245.4s)]
*  to be untrue for money, that like I never, I was shocked. It took me decades to figure out [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5251.0s)]
*  what's going on. And you hear people say, Oh, it's all about the money. And I'd be like, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5257.8s)]
*  that's bullshit. It's not, you know, we just have different views, different ideologies, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5261.08s)]
*  different worldviews. No, a lot of it was just about the money. And I just did not perceive it. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5265.16s)]
*  But how much money can a, can a multi-multi-millennial? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5270.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I agree. I mean, I've never been that well, that is absolutely right. First of all, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5273.32s)]
*  you know, getting out of debt, I do think is a massive blessing. And if you can get out of debt, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5278.44s)]
*  it just means you're not controlled. And there is an inherent freedom in that. And debt is slavery. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5283.88s)]
*  We love debt in the United States. We have a debt-based society, you know, lending money [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5288.44s)]
*  and interest. That's like the main thing that we do in the United States. I think it's disgusting. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5292.12s)]
*  I've always thought that. Um, so if you can get out of that, it's clearly liberation. But beyond that, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5295.56s)]
*  like, is it going to make you happy? No. I mean, I've just lived around rich people [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5302.2s)]
*  my whole life. So I know that that does not make you happy. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5306.68s)]
*  So if we accept, but if we accept that money's part of it, it must be more than that. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5309.0s)]
*  So what is the, what is the, what is the, because [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5312.44s)]
*  you know, you, one does end up with fewer and fewer options when it comes to explaining what's [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5316.2s)]
*  going on. And it just feels like it, you know, it does begin to feel as if it's in the service [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5322.76s)]
*  of some kind of dark. That's what it feels like. I mean, it is, it is in this, in the service of [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5327.88s)]
*  darkness. There's no kind of rational explanation for transgenderism. You know, that's just, you're [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5332.44s)]
*  sterilizing kids. There's no upside that could ever justify that. You're doing it for killing people. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5338.84s)]
*  As you know, the U S government has, I hate to say it as a patriotic American, but it's been a force [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5345.08s)]
*  for, for killing for a long time. What is that? And again, there's only a spiritual answer, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5351.0s)]
*  I think, to that question. I don't see a rational one for sure, but I also think it's recognizable [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5357.5599999999995s)]
*  in a temporal framework as hubris. It's the belief that you are God, that you have greater powers [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5363.24s)]
*  than any man actually possesses, greater foresight, greater wisdom, greater power. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5371.64s)]
*  And that is like the oldest trap there is. Like that is the story of history is people, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5377.0s)]
*  you know, convincing themselves that they're more than human. And, and that's, that's how you [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5382.76s)]
*  destroy yourself in the society that you lead for sure. And so what happens to what is, is, has the, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5387.240000000001s)]
*  has the American Republic fallen? And is it just something? The Republic is long gone. I mean, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5393.4800000000005s)]
*  the second you allow an intel agency to murder your democratic, radically elected president, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5399.4s)]
*  as we did 62 years ago, and then sort of ignore that it happened and be like, I don't think that's [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5403.24s)]
*  really what happened. Shut up. No, it's not. If you allow unelected bureaucrats to murder the guy [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5407.4s)]
*  that the majority elected, like just by definition, the system is not what they say it is, obviously. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5415.879999999999s)]
*  But I do think I agree with you 100%. And I agree with our, you know, long departed president, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5422.6s)]
*  Dwight Eisenhower, that it really was the second world war in ways that I don't understand, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5429.56s)]
*  but it's demonstrable, change the nature of the country, change the relationship [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5435.08s)]
*  between the population and its government. Can I ask you a question that I always think about, but [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5441.240000000001s)]
*  I'm, UK specific question. So 1914, UK, England, Britain, whatever we're calling it, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5444.6s)]
*  you know, is running the world, you know, and doing, I would say a pretty good job, not perfect [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5454.6s)]
*  job, pretty good job, putting in railways and spreading Christianity and being kind of pompous, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5459.64s)]
*  but basically being a fairly benign colonial power as colonial powers go. There's a war, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5465.400000000001s)]
*  four years, the smartest people in the country are all killed for no obvious reason. The country's [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5471.32s)]
*  really weakened by that war. The United States becomes a preeminent power in the world by 1919. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5475.96s)]
*  So it's a huge loss for Great Britain. I would say the first world war again, for no real reason. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5483.639999999999s)]
*  20 years later, your leaders tell you, got to do it again, for reasons that are clearly fake, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5489.48s)]
*  liberate Poland and then hand it to Stalin. That's not the reason, obviously. Democracy is not the [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5495.4s)]
*  reason. And then the country is really like wrecked and the empire collapses and it becomes sad. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5500.52s)]
*  Is there bitterness about that? Like, why wouldn't that be the, the bitterest thing that ever happened [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5506.200000000001s)]
*  in the history of your country? Are people still, do they talk about that? They brought us into two [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5511.0s)]
*  wars. It just destroyed us. All these cool things that we had, this great society that we had, we [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5515.160000000001s)]
*  made the, I think there's a, I think there is a, I think there is a, a, a, a lingering sadness, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5519.64s)]
*  but what about anger? Like your leaders said that there was no reason to join either war. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5527.24s)]
*  Well, the people, obviously in my lifetime, your lifetime, the veterans of the first world war, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5531.0s)]
*  they're all gone. Oh, of course. And the, you know, and the veterans of the second world war, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5536.759999999999s)]
*  you know, are the endangered species that they are, you know, they are almost all on the way out. And [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5541.48s)]
*  so, and so the, and once, once the, once the, the people to whom it happened are gone, then that [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5546.5199999999995s)]
*  takes something with them. You know, we, we, we don't, we're only angry with what happened at one [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5552.44s)]
*  remove in a sense, because the people who really suffered it are gone. But I hear what you're [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5559.879999999999s)]
*  saying about that. I was born 25 years after the war. I mean, you could say, I mean, you could say [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5567.5599999999995s)]
*  that Britain only became a second rate power after Suez, you know, which wasn't until 50, 56. So, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5572.2s)]
*  you could say that we were for, for whatever had happened to us courtesy of the first world war. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5579.5599999999995s)]
*  And then the second world war, it was, it was that, it was that [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5583.8s)]
*  shit show in Suez and that humiliation, you know, with, by America that Britain became a, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5590.2s)]
*  only then. So it was, yeah, but it was dead. I was dead after, you know, I would say it's much, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5597.48s)]
*  I think you do make me think about something that's not unconnected. I do think that what's [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5602.84s)]
*  happening at the moment, we will not understand what has actually happened here. Maybe in 50 [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5608.76s)]
*  years time, people look back, maybe in a hundred years time, in the same way that I would say, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5615.72s)]
*  you know, someone who went through the first world war, even if they were experiencing it, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5620.280000000001s)]
*  even if they were in the Western front or whatever, with the bullets flying and seeing all of the, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5624.04s)]
*  of the horror of it, it couldn't, couldn't possibly conceptualize the impact and the [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5628.92s)]
*  consequences and the significance and the way in which you don't live through a period and know [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5634.2s)]
*  that you might suspect that the world might be changed forever as a result of the period [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5639.96s)]
*  that you're living through, but to actually predict what will be the real consequences in 10, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5644.92s)]
*  in 50 years time is beyond all of us. I think, I think it's impossible. I think part of why people [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5652.36s)]
*  won't waken up to this at the moment and won't confront it is because it's, it's so big what's [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5658.68s)]
*  happening. I think it is going to be like a first world war, you know, through it, you know, someone [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5665.88s)]
*  said that the first world war was a set of iron railings between the, between the past and [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5671.72s)]
*  everything else, because you could see the past, but you could never reach it again. And I think, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5676.360000000001s)]
*  but that wouldn't have been a parent right at the time, you know, that wouldn't have been a [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5680.76s)]
*  parent even as the men were dying. It was not. I mean, my wife's great grandfather, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5684.28s)]
*  his picture is right over there, wrote a book about it, his service in France. And I've read it, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5688.28s)]
*  pretty great book. And it's the most cheerful book ever written, you know, sort of like he was a, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5693.16s)]
*  you know, successful guy in the United States who went over there and fight for something. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5698.44s)]
*  He didn't understand what he was fighting for. And he was in a good mood the whole time. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5701.5599999999995s)]
*  I think at some point, at some point again, in the same timeframe that we're talking about, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5705.16s)]
*  second world war thereafter, I think the world fell finally into the grip of the banks. It fell [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5709.16s)]
*  finally into the grip of those unelected, unaccountable for-profit groups for whom [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5715.88s)]
*  everything was only about money, money and power. And for them, they became anywheres at that point. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5725.5599999999995s)]
*  They didn't care about, they weren't, they didn't care about Britain, didn't care about America. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5733.16s)]
*  They just cared about money. You know, and I think, I think that has been, has been, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5737.88s)]
*  I think we lost in that slow motion consequence of the 20th century or the first half of the 20th [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5743.32s)]
*  century, that all of, all of what had been before, that kind of love of country, that kind of [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5753.5599999999995s)]
*  patriotism, that kind of identity, I think that was unmoored, unhitched at that point. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5763.4s)]
*  And something very large and slow moving just began to drift like a great liner, [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5773.639999999999s)]
*  you know, was no longer on its safe anchorage. And it's just, and it's only, and it's only now [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5778.919999999999s)]
*  that with our kind of 20s, 2020 vision of hindsight, that we're able to look back and see [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5785.08s)]
*  that that happened. When was the last time Britain had a leader who believed the country [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5790.28s)]
*  was more important than the banks? Well, you probably, you probably have to go back to pre [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5797.08s)]
*  1694 and the establishment of the Bank of England. I mean, that's when the Bank of England was set [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5804.84s)]
*  up and that's, and that became the model for the Fed in 1913 and the, you know, the creature of [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5811.0s)]
*  Jekyll Island. And I think, and, but then where do you start? You know, the city of London was [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5818.28s)]
*  established by, you know, at the time of William the Conqueror and there's a state within a state [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5826.12s)]
*  that's like the Vatican. It's a separate entity. People don't, you know, fully appreciate the [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5831.16s)]
*  extent to which the city of London is not Britain. It's a separate, it's a separate, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5837.0s)]
*  it's on police force. The monarch has to seek permission to enter the city of London. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5845.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a nominated person in parliament, the city, the city remembrance, who most people [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5850.44s)]
*  don't notice who's there all the time to make sure that the, the, the unique rights of the city of [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5855.5599999999995s)]
*  London are maintained and not compromised by any subsequent legislation. You know, so there's, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5861.72s)]
*  there's been a long period of that. So to get back to a time before the banks of Thrall, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5867.5599999999995s)]
*  you'd have to be before the banks were given, the Bank of England was given that magical power to [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5872.76s)]
*  create fiat money. That's when all the, you know, that's when the troubles started. Do you know [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5877.72s)]
*  about the Bradbury pound? That's a great story. Well, you know about, you know, the, what'd you [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5884.52s)]
*  call it? That Abe Lincoln had constitutional script, the greenbacks during the civil war, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5889.8s)]
*  obviously, you know, to get himself out of a financial hole. Well, the Bradbury pound came [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5895.4800000000005s)]
*  about in 1914 because there was a run on the banks. War had war, war was declared and people [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5900.44s)]
*  panic and the, and people are going to the banks with their bits of paper, the big bank notes. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5908.759999999999s)]
*  I promised to pay the bearer on demand, the sum of five pounds, 10 pounds. And in those days, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5913.639999999999s)]
*  you could actually get that transformed into gold. You'd, you could get the commensurate, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5918.36s)]
*  the, the, the, you know, the relevant gold. You know, it's transferable, had value. And, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5922.919999999999s)]
*  and so the banks had a run on, you know, they, they, they, they closed the banks, but there was [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5927.8s)]
*  an extended bank holiday. The, the, the bank went scuttling to the treasury. David Lloyd George was [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5932.92s)]
*  the, the, that was the, was the, was the, was the, was the person they sought out. The, the, the [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5939.88s)]
*  treasury, the government must've had an inkling that was happening because within, within three [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5946.6s)]
*  days, legislation was rushed through parliament. So they must've had something kind of ready to go. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5951.0s)]
*  And they created treasury notes. And the first Lord of the treasury was a man called, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5955.8s)]
*  I think it's John Bradbury, Bradbury anyway. And he put his signature was on these notes and they [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5962.68s)]
*  became, their nickname was the Bradbury Pounds. And so the banks reopened, the people were still [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5969.08s)]
*  queuing up, wanting to transfer their bank, bank notes into gold. They were persuaded to take these [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5975.16s)]
*  treasury notes instead. And people said, well, what, what's the value of these? And they were, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5981.4s)]
*  they were debt free and interest free. And they were underwritten by the, the notional value of [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5987.96s)]
*  Britain. The, everything that Britain was or is, its creativity, its people, its labour force, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=5994.679999999999s)]
*  its industry, everything. That's what underwrote the Bradbury Pound. And for whatever reason, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6000.679999999999s)]
*  people accepted it. Okay, I'll take these Bradbury Pounds. I'll take these treasury notes, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6006.44s)]
*  not bank notes, treasury notes, interest free, debt free. And that got, that saved the day. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6010.84s)]
*  The run on the bank was averted. Now, almost at once the banks said or realised, we can't have this. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6018.92s)]
*  This is debt free, interest free mode of exchange. What's in it for us? And so very quickly, they went [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6027.4800000000005s)]
*  back to the government, said, withdraw these Bradbury Pounds. Let's go back to the old days. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6035.4800000000005s)]
*  We'll buy government bonds. We'll give you bank notes. We'll call it 3%. 3% interest, sound fair. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6040.6s)]
*  The Bradbury Pounds were, I think the last one actually didn't come out of circulation until [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6048.200000000001s)]
*  maybe in the late, many years later. I can't remember exactly when the last one came out [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6051.72s)]
*  of circulation. Britain's national debt in 1914, before the war, was about 650 million pounds. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6057.240000000001s)]
*  By 1918, it was 7.5 billion because the bankers had regained control. But for a moment, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6067.4800000000005s)]
*  for a moment with the advent of this debt free, interest free, treasury note underwritten by the [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6078.040000000001s)]
*  notional or real value of Britain, there was a currency went out into general circulation that [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6085.56s)]
*  could have changed everything. Imagine if people, imagine if the banks had been disempowered [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6093.24s)]
*  because they didn't have the power of debt. They didn't have the power of usury, interest, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6097.719999999999s)]
*  whatever you want to call it. But they realised we're not having this. So having been got out [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6101.48s)]
*  of the hole of the run on the gold, the Bradbury Pounds were taken away. Nobody noticed. There's [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6107.32s)]
*  a war on and the national debt, that began its cycling upwards. Could crypto be a Bradbury Pound? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6112.599999999999s)]
*  I get, I host, I seek to host conversations about Bitcoin and crypto from time to time. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6123.88s)]
*  I'll make no bones about it. I'm not really sure that I properly, I'm an expert in a position to [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6133.0s)]
*  say whether I think it's the freedom of humanity or not. I hear very strong voices on either side. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6139.24s)]
*  People say it's a Ponzi scheme and a con and don't go near it. Other people say, no, this is [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6143.8s)]
*  the foundation upon which we will rebuild society. And somewhere between those two [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6147.8s)]
*  polar extremes must lie the truth. I think there are elements about it, distributed ledger, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6153.320000000001s)]
*  blockchain. I think somewhere within there are profound solutions because I have asked and had [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6164.84s)]
*  a vague yes, whether or not you could use the blockchain protocol to have, say, a news channel [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6172.12s)]
*  that couldn't be shut down because it's peer to peer. The currency exchange with Bitcoin is [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6180.5199999999995s)]
*  peer to peer, person to person without the intercedence of a bank. Hypothetically, they say, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6185.64s)]
*  yes, you could distribute information. Bitcoin essentially is a transaction of information. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6191.72s)]
*  Therefore, you could exchange news in that way and the baddies couldn't get at it. Hypothetically. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6200.76s)]
*  The cryptocurrency or Bitcoin and blockchain interests me for that reason. Although I listen [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6211.56s)]
*  to very strong voices saying, don't go anywhere near Bitcoin. It's been hacked. The banks have [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6219.160000000001s)]
*  got control of it and so on and so on. I think somewhere within that thinking, there might be [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6225.08s)]
*  some of the answer. How long until you get pulled off the air? Oh, I don't know. I do genuinely. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6231.96s)]
*  If you're living in a country that is trying to criminalize conversations at your dinner table [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6242.2s)]
*  between you and your kids, send you to prison for seven years for having the wrong opinions. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6247.4s)]
*  I think it's a bold, not me. I'm a small fry in these things, but I'm a minnow swimming in these [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6252.04s)]
*  waters. Nonetheless, these are bold moves because I think the people that are seeking the control [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6260.2s)]
*  with everything, with digital currency, with digital IDs, with all of it, are cowardly [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6269.24s)]
*  frightened people. I think we're dealing with, I think we have created an ecosystem [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6276.04s)]
*  that has enabled to thrive the most frightened, psychopathic, parasitic, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6281.08s)]
*  cacostocratic leadership the world has yet seen. We have created the conditions for them. We've [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6287.64s)]
*  got to take responsibility for the fact that they are our fault. You get the government you deserve. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6294.28s)]
*  That's true. So we can't wash our hands of it. Nonetheless, I think they're scared. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6299.8s)]
*  Very, very, very frightened people. What they're most frightened of is everyone else. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6305.56s)]
*  They're probably frightened of each other. I think there's a line that, will they cross it [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6310.12s)]
*  and do the wet work that would be required? They're operating at one remove from really hurting [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6318.360000000001s)]
*  people physically, really going the lengths of throwing people into gulags and concentration [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6326.44s)]
*  camps. They're not there yet. Are they ready? Do they have the backbone to actually start, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6334.759999999999s)]
*  not so much people like me, but bigger fish? Are they really going to do that? I don't know [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6341.0s)]
*  if they've really got it in them. As long as people keep- [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6346.759999999999s)]
*  Well, if they're proposing jail time for people who criticize them, that suggests they do have [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6350.839999999999s)]
*  it in them. Let's see what actually happens. I think some of it is brinkmanship and I'm not [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6355.0s)]
*  persuaded that they've got the cajones to be the authoritarians that they fantasize about being. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6364.76s)]
*  Well, it depends on circumstance. Once the virus, intentionally or not, got out of the lab in Wuhan, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6371.72s)]
*  the COVID virus, then they moved immediately to institute totalitarian rule. That will happen [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6379.24s)]
*  again. They're still doing gain of function research, as you well know. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6388.04s)]
*  But don't you think- [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6390.679999999999s)]
*  There'll be a real virus that escapes. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6391.88s)]
*  I don't think so. I'm not sure there ever was anything. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6393.639999999999s)]
*  So does it strike you that the way that you think about people is influenced by Freud and by people [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6410.2s)]
*  who think about human behavior in non-chemical terms, in moral, spiritual terms? That whole way [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6420.679999999999s)]
*  of thinking has kind of disappeared. I mean, that was a feature of our childhoods where people would [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6426.84s)]
*  say, well, you have unresolved issues, guilt, whatever. You didn't live up to your own standards. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6430.599999999999s)]
*  You take that with you. Now it's like you've got a chemical imbalance. We can't even [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6435.08s)]
*  I don't think young people can even analyze human behavior in those terms. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6439.320000000001s)]
*  I think it's part and parcel of an anti-human agenda. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6442.68s)]
*  What has been done fundamentally is anti-human. It's being done to people who see no inherent- [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6447.240000000001s)]
*  they don't know what it means to be human and alive. Therefore, they can be casual [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6455.96s)]
*  and contemptuous of people in account of billions because they have got away from [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6463.0s)]
*  the sovereign human being and what it means. We've barely floated a dugout canoe onto the [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6470.679999999999s)]
*  Pacific Ocean of the unknown as the human consciousness. We've already got the [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6483.32s)]
*  transhumanists, not the transgender, the transhumanists who are already preaching [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6491.96s)]
*  that the human being, mark one, is suboptimal and needs an upgrade via technology. They want to [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6496.84s)]
*  blend humans with tech, digitized, you know, as human beings because the time of the biological [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6507.16s)]
*  human is partly over. But that's a product of the wrong kind of people not even asking [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6515.48s)]
*  what it means to be human and alive. Well, it's a rebellion against God too. I mean, if, you know, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6523.5599999999995s)]
*  as Christians certainly, but I think Muslims and Jews also, certainly Jews do, believe that human [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6528.84s)]
*  beings were created in God's image, you know, to deface that image is to attack God, right? [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6535.96s)]
*  And so to declare people inherently inadequate, you know, that's a theological concept, I think. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6542.92s)]
*  It's all, it's bound up with many, as I say, it's going to be a hundred years or more, but, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6550.52s)]
*  you know, obviously you're like in 1968, Paul Ehrlich wrote The Population Ball and at the same [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6554.92s)]
*  time, actually, Garrett Hardin wrote The Tragedy of the Commons and they both speculated about the [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6561.8s)]
*  basic crappiness and rubbishness of people in large numbers, you know, they'll just make a mess of [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6567.320000000001s)]
*  everything. And it was that return of that neo-Malthusian approach to people. There's too [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6572.4400000000005s)]
*  many of them and they're not worth having anyway. So this is going to be the ending of us. And the [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6577.72s)]
*  predictions of Ehrlich and so on were wrong. You got it completely wrong. And we, I talk to people, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6581.8s)]
*  I interview people all the time who are saying, and you'll be across this, that birth rates are [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6589.0s)]
*  plummeting across the West. It's not just in the West. Japan is poised to disappear in a hundred [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6595.0s)]
*  years. There won't be any Japanese people. So it's not even a Western phenomenon. Swathes of [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6601.08s)]
*  populations are not producing enough people to keep themselves going. It's true in Britain and [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6608.6s)]
*  France, all across Europe. It's true in America. It's really bad in America. People are having like [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6613.72s)]
*  1.4, 1.5 children on average, which is not enough to sustain. And so, and people are not [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6617.48s)]
*  appreciating that they are sitting in the cheap seats on a plane that is a tailspin that may not, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6623.959999999999s)]
*  it may not be possible even if you could get to the controls to pull the plane back into level [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6630.04s)]
*  flight. It may have gone beyond that point. And so you've got that information out there. At the [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6634.2s)]
*  same time as people like Bill Gates and others are saying, we've got to check the human population. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6639.959999999999s)]
*  We've got too many people. And in a hundred years time, there's not going to be anybody here. Well, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6645.400000000001s)]
*  I'm being, I'm using hyperbole, but populations are in steep decline and it's the explanations [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6651.88s)]
*  for our existential, you know, it has to do with maybe possibly falling fertility. And God knows [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6658.360000000001s)]
*  what we've done to fertility with these products that we've jammed into several billion people. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6664.2s)]
*  We'll see, we'll see what the fertility consequences of all that are in due course. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6668.76s)]
*  I think we know. I think we know. But in any event, there's also people delaying having children. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6673.16s)]
*  And then when, you know, so many women, when they do reach a point where they do want to have [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6679.72s)]
*  children, they're now in maybe their mid thirties, their late thirties, the relevant partner is not [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6683.4s)]
*  there at the right time. And so they miss that. So there's all sorts of existential reasons, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6687.88s)]
*  societal reasons for the plummeting. But they got to work at a consulting firm in the ensuing years. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6693.8s)]
*  But what I'm saying is that we know this and yet the Malthusians are still out there [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6700.360000000001s)]
*  banging the drum for fewer people. They can't get rid of people fast enough. They can't quickly [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6705.64s)]
*  enough deter people from having more people. Isn't that genocide? Like, isn't that what that is? [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6711.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's anti-species. And again, again, it's coming down to people, I think, who are not [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6718.200000000001s)]
*  properly invested in the future. And they're certainly not invested in the future of humankind. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6725.24s)]
*  They're not giving their last measure of devotion to making sure there's people in... [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6731.4s)]
*  But there's a good level of hate. So there's a football player, you probably haven't followed [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6736.599999999999s)]
*  this, but in the United States, kicker, who gave a college commencement speech the other day. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6740.2s)]
*  And in it, he said... [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6745.639999999999s)]
*  I did, Trudy and I watched it this morning. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6746.76s)]
*  Oh, by chance. We watched it online. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6748.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6751.0s)]
*  Now you're deeply steeped in the politics of the United States. But then you saw how moderate it [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6751.32s)]
*  was. He's like, you know, as you grow older, you might want to have kids, because that's a [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6754.52s)]
*  source of enduring joy. And all these politicians and cultural figures and... I can't remember that [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6758.76s)]
*  chick's name, but Taylor Swift, some sort of fake entertainer, gets out there and denounces the guy [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6765.72s)]
*  as a Neanderthal and as evil because he suggests that having children may be more rewarding than [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6773.88s)]
*  your stupid career. Why would you be mad at someone for encouraging young people to have [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6779.96s)]
*  children? That's very weird to me. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6786.52s)]
*  I was listening to Jordan Peterson years ago. I'm not claiming that as a badge of honor or anything, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6788.28s)]
*  just a fact. Way before everything that's happening at the moment, I came across him years and years [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6794.04s)]
*  ago. I think it was courtesy of the Joe Rogan experience. He was part of that, the intellectual [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6799.08s)]
*  Dart Webb, remember? The Sam Harris, Bret Weinstein, Heather Haying and Jordan Peterson [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6804.2s)]
*  and so on. And I remember being really very profoundly struck by a lot of the things that [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6810.76s)]
*  Peterson had to say about children and parenthood. And for example, I really remember I'm saying that [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6816.599999999999s)]
*  so many people say they don't want to have a baby because it's going to interfere with their [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6822.5199999999995s)]
*  lifestyle. And he said, I really have to ask what kind of lifestyle is it that you can't take a [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6825.88s)]
*  baby with you. And I thought, yeah, because Trudy and I, from when we had our first and then we [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6830.2s)]
*  got three, they always came with us. They just were there. Then there were two of them and then [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6837.88s)]
*  there were three of them and they just went everywhere. It didn't impinge on anything. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6844.84s)]
*  And obviously it goes without saying that it made our lives by inexpressible orders of magnitude [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6850.12s)]
*  richer. And yet, you know, the abiding message out there is that, oh no, there's better things [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6858.04s)]
*  to do than be families. That's anti-human at the base level. Well, so then I want to ask you just [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6863.64s)]
*  finally about one of the great trends in the West, and it is only in the West, is the climate [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6869.8s)]
*  hysteria. How do you assess that? That seems part of this larger whole. It's a hoax. It's a hoax in [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6877.56s)]
*  what sense? Well, it's multifaceted. The climate is changing because that's what the climate does. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6885.72s)]
*  Like weather, you know, the climate changes. We did have glaciers at one point. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6895.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. When they started measuring temperature, we were just coming out of the little ice age, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6900.360000000001s)]
*  which had lasted for hundreds of years. And temperatures were as low on planet Earth as [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6906.84s)]
*  they'd been for thousands of years at that point. So when it comes to measuring temperature, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6911.0s)]
*  there was only really one way for, unless we were going to go extinct or go straight into another [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6914.84s)]
*  full ice age, there was only one way for the temperatures to go, which was up. And so the [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6918.6s)]
*  fact that there has been sustained increase in temperature, well, it would be because it was [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6922.4400000000005s)]
*  coming from the bottom of the well. The only way was up. Also, it used to be accepted as the accepted [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6926.4400000000005s)]
*  fact that increasing carbon dioxide follows a rise in temperature. It doesn't cause it. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6937.08s)]
*  Right. As the world gets warmer, there's a kind of a several hundred year lag. And then there's [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6943.0s)]
*  more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a consequence of that warming. And so to tell [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6949.400000000001s)]
*  people that carbon dioxide is causing the increase in temperature would be like seeing a horse and [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6955.64s)]
*  cart on a road from space and imagining that the cart was pushing the horse because you could see [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6962.92s)]
*  it moving. That would be how wrong you are. It's the horse pulling the cart. And likewise, CO2, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6967.96s)]
*  there's more of it once the planet's warmer. But I think it's 800 years is the lag. So there are all [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6975.96s)]
*  sorts of reasons for being aware that this way in which people are being frightened into thinking [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6982.12s)]
*  that there's a catastrophic apocalypse coming because they've got gas central heating and they [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6987.88s)]
*  drive fossil fuel cars is a hoax. There's a big complicated picture to do with the climate [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=6993.16s)]
*  changing. It used to be called in the seventies. I remember the documentary with Leonard Nimoy [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7000.92s)]
*  very well talking about, you know, we were getting into an ice age. That was just the seventies. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7006.12s)]
*  And then it became global warming. But then because that isn't holding up, it's become climate change. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7009.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, yeah, of course climate changes. And then in any event, what's being done in response to it [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7015.24s)]
*  is not green and it's anti-human. You know, as advocates of fossil fuels say, if we are, [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7023.5599999999995s)]
*  if we are, let's say we are going into a time of climate uncertainty and instability, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7029.96s)]
*  that would be the very time you wouldn't want to deal with the ability to cheaply and readily [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7034.84s)]
*  heat homes or air condition them. That would be true. As appropriate. I mean, if something's [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7039.08s)]
*  going to happen, this would be the, you know, you do not throw away your matches, you know, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7043.96s)]
*  at the time when you might need to light a fire. And also the, you know, the wind turbines that [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7049.4800000000005s)]
*  now are at the end of the life cycle and they're just being landfilled. These vast, unrecyclable [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7056.6s)]
*  plastic things are just being buried in the ground. They are being made in any event using [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7062.52s)]
*  fossil fuels. They can't be recycled. Electric cars. That's just a means to get people out of [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7068.4400000000005s)]
*  their cars and back onto, I don't know, horses or Shanks's pony or whatever. So it's not, it's not [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7074.28s)]
*  green. What is being done? The planet, we're making a mess. You know, look what happens in the [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7082.28s)]
*  extraction of the lithiums and other rare earth metals are required for electric batteries. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7089.08s)]
*  Look at the child slavery that that entails. Look at the scarification of the planet that's [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7095.5599999999995s)]
*  involved in the extraction of those things, the destruction of ecosystems and habitats in [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7101.64s)]
*  pursuit of green energy. Really? Seriously? And the one, you know, the one clean green [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7106.4400000000005s)]
*  energy that is available, which is nuclear is strictly verboten because well, [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7112.6s)]
*  but because we've been told that you can't have nuclear energy. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7117.240000000001s)]
*  So in Europe, you've seen a spate of climate cultists destroying medieval art. You know, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7119.160000000001s)]
*  it's never modern art. It's always Christian art, but I've noticed, but, but they've gone into [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7124.84s)]
*  museums and spray painted or slash paintings. I don't think you've seen any vandalism of private [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7130.28s)]
*  planes at all. So if you believe in the kind of schematic, if you believe in the story of climate [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7135.5599999999995s)]
*  change as an existential threat, you know, the first thing you would do is get rid of private [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7141.16s)]
*  air travel, but that doesn't occur to anybody. I don't understand. Like what is that? What are [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7146.36s)]
*  we watching? Well, you've got that, you've got that bizarre situation where the rich at the world [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7151.0s)]
*  economic forum and Davos and other places are openly saying that because of carbon credits, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7155.72s)]
*  as rich people will buy the carbon credits of poor people that can't afford to go on holiday anyway. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7160.360000000001s)]
*  And that will offset our private jets and private yachts. You're not using your carbon credits [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7165.4800000000005s)]
*  anyway, because you can barely afford to feed yourself or your family. So you're definitely [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7170.360000000001s)]
*  not going on holiday this year. So I'll, I'll, I'll take, I'll take your credit, your carbon [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7173.96s)]
*  credits off your hand and I'll, I'll use that to legitimize my, the perpetuation of my luxurious [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7178.04s)]
*  lifestyle. You know, the hypocrisy of it, the rubbing of people's noses in it is off the scale. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7183.96s)]
*  And again, it's anti-human. If, if for one of the kind of farming techniques and the, and the, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7191.24s)]
*  and the fertilizers that we have, there's very good reason for thinking that half the world's [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7197.8s)]
*  population will starve to death for one of the kind of fertilizers that are made from oil, [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7203.56s)]
*  you know, so they just stop oil. So you're going to see famines. I don't think there's any doubt [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7209.24s)]
*  about that soon. And when that happens, what, you know, will people blame each other as they've [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7213.16s)]
*  been instructed to do, or will they finally figure out that this is all manufactured? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7218.68s)]
*  Well, I think again, being, being, being absolutely, it being an inalienable [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7222.599999999999s)]
*  responsibility to be positive. I would have to answer yes to that question that more, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7228.44s)]
*  more people do. Well, I can say for one, I see it now and I didn't used to. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7233.08s)]
*  So I've added to the count by one and Trudy sees it and she didn't used to. So that's two [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7236.92s)]
*  and our kids do. So that's five, you know, so just in my circle, I'm seeing people wakening up [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7241.72s)]
*  on a very personal level. So, so yes, I do, I do think that enough people are seeing the, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7248.12s)]
*  the way in which we are being played. We are being an attempt, a galactic scale attempt to pull the [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7256.68s)]
*  wool over our eyes is, is going on. And more and more people are seeing it and they're seeing that [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7264.4400000000005s)]
*  people are being uprooted from their, their homelands and have been for generations and [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7271.0s)]
*  they're turning up where they, you know, maybe oughtn't to be. And instead of people in, in, [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7277.0s)]
*  you know, pausing for a moment to think, why is this disruption happening? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7285.24s)]
*  They just get angry with the victims of it. And I'm not saying I'm not, I'm not, I mean, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7290.6s)]
*  I'm sure there are, I'm sure there are bad lads and, and, and criminals and absolutely the sort [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7294.84s)]
*  of people of whatever creed and color that you wouldn't want in your communities. I do, I see, [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7300.92s)]
*  I get that. Absolutely. But they wouldn't be here if the governments and NGOs hadn't brought them [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7304.76s)]
*  here. But the bigger picture is, I mean, look at the, you know, they're building a bridge in the [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7308.92s)]
*  Darien gap to make it easier for the NGOs and the WHO and the UN and the rest of them to, to, [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7311.8s)]
*  to drive people into the United States from the South. If you can, if, as I say, I'm, I'm seeing [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7316.76s)]
*  it and more and more people are seeing it and all it, all it really takes is for people to realize [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7324.52s)]
*  that the trouble is not beside you, it's above you. And there's not, it's not a big, it's not a big [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7330.120000000001s)]
*  group. And actually the techniques are old, worn out and transparent from overuse. And, you know, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7335.160000000001s)]
*  there's nothing to fear, but the fear they sow, I would say. I can't believe that I am more [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7343.56s)]
*  pessimistic than a Scott. Well, you've probably got Scottish genes, but there's no, but there's, [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7351.08s)]
*  that's a zero sum game, Tucker. You can't, you've got to be, you've got to, you've got to, it's like, [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7358.68s)]
*  it's like taking your castor oil. It's like taking your, you've got to, you've got to, [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7364.44s)]
*  you've got to be optimistic because it's your, it's your obligation. It's nothing less than [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7368.28s)]
*  your obligation to force yourself to be optimistic. You can't, you cannot go to the, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7374.36s)]
*  to the dark side until it's all over, in which case it won't matter anyway. But I don't think, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7380.759999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. Neil Oliver, thank you on that. I appreciate it. Thank you, Tucker Carlson. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7386.759999999999s)]
*  We hope you'll do that also. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ7PYrofEQ&t=7404.36s)]
