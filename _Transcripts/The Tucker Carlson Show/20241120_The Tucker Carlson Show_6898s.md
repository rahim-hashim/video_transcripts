# Glenn Greenwald Dangerous New Escalation in Russia, & Our Blackmailed Politicians
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ)
*  I think we're watching the most evil thing I've ever seen in my lifetime, which is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=0.0s)]
*  lame duck administration leaving the next administration with the World War, with the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3.68s)]
*  nuclear conflict, by allowing Ukraine, a proxy state of the United States, to strike within [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=7.76s)]
*  Russia. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  And I'll just have one editorial comment and then I'm going to let you go. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  But I think that people in Washington misunderstand Vladimir Putin and they think he's a monarch [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=16.76s)]
*  with absolute power, which is not true. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=20.88s)]
*  And Russian politics is complex and it's lively and Putin is very concerned with his prorating [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=23.16s)]
*  within Russia. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=28.38s)]
*  He cannot appear weak. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=29.72s)]
*  That's a huge threat to him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=31.16s)]
*  He feels that, I can confirm. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=32.16s)]
*  And if he can't hide attacks on him by the United States through Ukraine, either a Moscow [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=34.76s)]
*  or big civilian casualties, I think he will have no choice in his view but to launch a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=41.96s)]
*  serious response against Ukraine or NATO countries or possibly the United States. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  So this seems like the most reckless thing that's ever happened in my life. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  I hardly have words for it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=59.08s)]
*  Let me just... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=61.32s)]
*  Am I overstating it, do you think? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=62.32s)]
*  No, no, not even remotely. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=63.32s)]
*  So let me just say specifically what has been authorized. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=64.96s)]
*  This is something that some NATO countries, including the United Kingdom, have been pressuring [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=89.44s)]
*  the Biden administration to do for quite a long time, for at least a year. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=93.56s)]
*  But going all the way back to the beginning of 2022, this was an option that they had, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=97.8s)]
*  which was that we have these guided missiles called Atacams, which are very powerful for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  attacking inside Russia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=107.5s)]
*  You can guide them specifically and very precisely to where you want them to go. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, you have to get intelligence about where you want to strike. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=112.96s)]
*  And the reason we never permitted the Ukrainians to use them is because the Ukrainians can't [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=116.64s)]
*  use those missiles on their own. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  In other words, if they want to launch these missiles, it's not just the US giving them [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=124.04s)]
*  the missiles and then telling them, no problem, go and use them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  It requires the direct involvement of the United States and or a major NATO country [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  like France or the UK or Germany, because the Ukrainians don't have the guiding capability [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=134.6s)]
*  in order to know how to launch these missiles. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=139.88s)]
*  So this is not just us giving them missiles and saying, go attack deep inside Russia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=142.52s)]
*  Even if some major country, China, Iran, Russia, whoever gave missiles to Canada, if we were [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=148.1s)]
*  at war with them or Mexico or Cuba, and said, we're giving you these specifically for you [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=155.42s)]
*  to use them inside the United States. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  We would consider that a grievous act of war, not just on the part of the country shooting [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=162.54s)]
*  them, but on the part of the country giving them what Biden did here is so much worse. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  He didn't just give Ukrainians missiles and say, feel free to use them inside Russia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=170.9s)]
*  We are going to participate in the bombing of Russia, NATO and or the United States, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=174.94s)]
*  because there's no way the Ukrainians can launch these missiles on their own, which [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=180.72s)]
*  means we are now our military, our intelligence community are participating in missile attacks [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=183.26s)]
*  inside the country of Russia. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=191.1s)]
*  This is something that even the Biden administration for all their hawkishness on Russia and Ukraine, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=194.38s)]
*  feeding that war, fueling it, preventing diplomatic resolutions because they wanted this war, even [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=198.78s)]
*  they were unwilling to do it because they understood the dangers of the escalatory risks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  For Joe Biden, or whoever's acting in his name, to do this just two weeks after the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  country resoundingly rejected governance by the Democratic Party in the administration [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=214.44s)]
*  and on his way out as an 81 year old man, knowing that he has about six weeks off in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  office to just say, I know that these are massive risks, but I'm willing to take them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=226.8s)]
*  I'm 81. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  I don't really care. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=232.7s)]
*  And then to make it so much more difficult for the following administration to do what [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=234.22s)]
*  they promised to do during the campaign, which the American people voted for and wanted, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=238.82s)]
*  which is to resolve this war. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=242.5s)]
*  Instead, we're risking escalation with the world's largest superpower, nuclear power. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=244.22s)]
*  Over what? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=251.34s)]
*  Over what? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=252.34s)]
*  We, I mean, placed in context to this is without precedent. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=253.34s)]
*  And I think it's blink. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=257.42s)]
*  I don't want to ask about that in a second, but so 1956 Soviets invade Hungary and murder [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=258.62s)]
*  a ton of people. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=264.5s)]
*  61, they put nuclear weapons in Cuba. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=265.5s)]
*  68, they invade Slovakia, murder a bunch of people once again. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=268.22s)]
*  These are all incredibly provocative acts, far more provocative than invading eastern [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  And this was the middle of the Cold War and no American presidents, Democrats and Republicans [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=277.98s)]
*  in charge during those periods. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=281.38s)]
*  They didn't respond by attacking Russia. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=283.74s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing like this has ever happened. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=287.38s)]
*  No one's ever been this crazy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=289.02s)]
*  Well, this is my big breach with the laugh, my big permanent split with whatever they [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=290.82s)]
*  thought I was in terms of. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=296.62s)]
*  Wait, is it permanent too? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  They hate you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, I know. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=300.41999999999996s)]
*  And that all happened in 2016 when out of nowhere, Russiagate appeared. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=301.56s)]
*  And I remember like it was yesterday, the very first ad from Hillary Clinton's campaign [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=306.5s)]
*  with this like menacing baritone voice. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=310.78s)]
*  What does Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have in common? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  What does Russia have on Donald Trump? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=318.62s)]
*  And journalistically, I just couldn't believe it because it was so redolent of McCarthyism, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  which is a civil libertarianism. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  I found I was taught was like one of the worst civil liberties in the 20th century. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=327.34s)]
*  And by the way, I agree. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=332.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you go around just accusing people of being Russian agents with no evidence, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  destroying their reputation, their lives, kind of like what they're trying to do to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=337.46s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=340.1s)]
*  Now what they tried to do for Donald Trump for the last eight years. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=341.1s)]
*  So just on that ground, I was kind of offended by it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=343.54s)]
*  Journalistically, I was so skeptical of it because when you have intelligence agencies [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=346.3s)]
*  leaking anonymously, unverified claims to the Washington Post and the New York Times, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=352.82000000000005s)]
*  and they put it on the front page and gather pollsters for them, that's usually a sign [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=357.06s)]
*  that a huge disinformation campaign of deceit is underway. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=360.18s)]
*  That was the exact method used, for example, to sell the war on Iraq to the American people [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=363.42s)]
*  was that kind of process. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  That's why these intelligence agencies need to be rooted out. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=370.38s)]
*  But what alarmed me most was that the climate was deliberately created in Washington, especially [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=372.7s)]
*  once Hillary lost and they blamed Russia for it, that any communications with Russia, anyone [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=379.42s)]
*  who visits Russia, anyone who talks to a Russian official is automatically deemed sinister [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=386.06s)]
*  or treasonous. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=391.3s)]
*  And as you said, during the Cold War, which dominated our American life for 50 years, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=392.94s)]
*  Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union the evil empire. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=398.14000000000004s)]
*  They were infinitely more powerful, more threatening, more everything than Russia is now. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=400.70000000000005s)]
*  We always communicated with Soviet leaders. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=407.46000000000004s)]
*  There were phones all over Washington that rang to the counterparts. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=410.94s)]
*  They communicated constantly. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  After Russiagate, there's basically no communication any longer between the Russian leaders and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=417.18s)]
*  the American leaders. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=422.26000000000005s)]
*  On either side, and I should just say, I mean- [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=423.26000000000005s)]
*  Not because Russia wanted that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=426.26000000000005s)]
*  That was something that in Washington got created because they blamed Russia and claimed [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=428.58000000000004s)]
*  that Russia was our existential enemy because of the claim that they interfered in the 2016 [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  election. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=438.22s)]
*  Before that, there was all kinds of, the Obama administration and the Putin government cooperated [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=439.22s)]
*  in all sorts of ways around the world. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=443.94000000000005s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=446.14000000000004s)]
*  But it's the leadership of the Republican Party too. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=447.14000000000004s)]
*  I had a conversation with the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, and he was about to appropriate [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=449.34000000000003s)]
*  tens of billions more for Ukraine. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=454.02s)]
*  And I said, well, why don't you check with Putin? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=455.5s)]
*  You're the Speaker of the House, you're number three in line for the presidency. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=457.06s)]
*  Well, why can't I? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  I said, well, I'll see if I can facilitate that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=460.97999999999996s)]
*  I'll call the press office, kind of set you up. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=463.29999999999995s)]
*  Why don't you talk to Putin? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=465.26s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=466.9s)]
*  Will not. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=468.38s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=469.38s)]
*  Imagine if he had though, and that leaked. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=470.38s)]
*  But I'm not excusing him. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=472.06s)]
*  Why wouldn't he just say, I mean, I'm not attacking Mike Johnson. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=473.21999999999997s)]
*  I guess I am attacking Mike Johnson. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=476.18s)]
*  I don't know what I'm saying. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=477.18s)]
*  I'm just reporting what actually happened. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=478.18s)]
*  I said, you know, like, don't you have a moral duty to get as much information about this [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=479.90000000000003s)]
*  war before you fund its continuation and the killing of all these people? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=485.90000000000003s)]
*  Like, shouldn't you know more? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=490.38s)]
*  No. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=491.38s)]
*  I think it is important to say that this war has been 100% bipartisan, although the Biden [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=492.38s)]
*  administration as the leader of the executive branch is primarily responsible. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=496.18s)]
*  The primary, there's been about, I would say, five or six dozen anti-interventionist Republicans, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=500.18s)]
*  typically more Trump supporters, both in the House and Senate, who have spoken out [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=507.34s)]
*  from the beginning against funding this war. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=511.09999999999997s)]
*  But the vast majority of Republicans, to the extent they have a criticism or had a criticism [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=513.4s)]
*  with the Biden administration at all with respect to Ukraine, it was that they didn't [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  do enough. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=520.86s)]
*  They didn't spend enough money on Ukraine. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=521.86s)]
*  They didn't give Ukraine enough weapons. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=522.86s)]
*  They didn't get more involved more heavily and earlier than they should. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=524.14s)]
*  But you know, the thing that you said about encouraging Mike Johnson to speak to Putin, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=528.9s)]
*  which of course, as the third in line to the presidency, as you said, when they're proposing [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=534.02s)]
*  it to escalate a major war, of course you should want to understand the Russian perspective. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=537.74s)]
*  This is what Tulsi Gabbard did in 2017 when she was a member of Congress and the Obama [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=542.5799999999999s)]
*  administration had unleashed this billion dollar a year CIA dirty war to change the government [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=550.06s)]
*  of Syria, to dislodge Basra al-Assad from the government. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=556.14s)]
*  When we fought along ISIS and al-Qaeda, who also wanted Assad gone, we were told those [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=560.54s)]
*  were our existential enemies for 15 years, we fought alongside them to do it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=565.42s)]
*  So many of the weapons we sent ended up in the hands of al-Qaeda and ISIS and other Islamic [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=569.26s)]
*  radical groups in Syria. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=573.02s)]
*  And Tulsi Gabbard as a member of the military, but also as a member of Congress with constitutional [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=575.38s)]
*  responsibility to authorize or disauthorize a war, wanted to go to Syria and see what [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=579.14s)]
*  was happening for herself. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=583.14s)]
*  And then she spoke with Syrian officials and got an opportunity to speak with the Syrian [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=584.4599999999999s)]
*  president and based solely on that, she's now accused of being a Russian agent, being [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=587.78s)]
*  a some sort of treasonous sympathizer of Bashar al-Assad. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=592.5799999999999s)]
*  This is the jingoistic climate that has been created way worse than what prevailed in the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=599.74s)]
*  Cold War. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=603.3399999999999s)]
*  When Nixon went to China, Reagan negotiated all kinds of arms deals with the Soviets, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=604.3399999999999s)]
*  this is now totally prohibited. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=611.38s)]
*  It's like we live in a Marvel cartoon for children where there's good guys and bad guys [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=613.26s)]
*  where the good guys and you don't speak to the bad guys. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=617.58s)]
*  And the good guys are al-Qaeda and ISIS, they're the good guys. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=619.5s)]
*  Yeah, we can fight with them because they're weird. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=622.1800000000001s)]
*  So her point, I don't want to speak for Tulsi Gabbard, our new director of national intelligence [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=623.7800000000001s)]
*  nominee, but my view was I don't have any feelings about Assad or Syria, but it's a [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=627.6600000000001s)]
*  fact that that government protected religious minorities, including an ancient Christian [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=633.26s)]
*  community there and the Alawites of which he's one, in that country for a long time, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=637.22s)]
*  he and his dad. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=641.62s)]
*  So why are they my enemy exactly? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=642.62s)]
*  I don't understand, why should I be opposed to Assad in Syria? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=645.54s)]
*  Why should I be opposed to Vladimir Putin? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=649.3s)]
*  I was not supposed to be opposed to the Soviets who were anti-Christian, but now you have [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=653.2199999999999s)]
*  a pro-Christian president, I'm supposed to be against him. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=656.3399999999999s)]
*  Tell me, why doesn't someone explain to me why? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=658.42s)]
*  As a 55-year-old American taxpayer, I should be against it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=660.8599999999999s)]
*  First of all, I think the principle is that, and this is what Donald Trump explicitly in [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=664.18s)]
*  2016 was that we shouldn't be involved in wars designed to change the governments of [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=668.58s)]
*  other countries, rebuild their government, transform their societies, in part because [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=675.46s)]
*  it's not our place to do it and in part because we're terrible at doing it because they have [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=681.0200000000001s)]
*  very complex, rich, long histories that American intelligence officials and political leaders [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=684.58s)]
*  have no understanding of whatsoever. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=690.4200000000001s)]
*  They don't speak the freaking language. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=692.4200000000001s)]
*  They don't know anything. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=694.4200000000001s)]
*  They know nothing. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=695.4200000000001s)]
*  We've proven that over and over in all these failed attempts, but also when it comes to, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=696.74s)]
*  I mean, Poulsey Gabbard's entire worldview, and I have spoken to her about this, I've [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=701.14s)]
*  interviewed her about this, so I feel comfortable saying this, is that she's not in any way [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=705.62s)]
*  anti-war pacifist. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=709.62s)]
*  She believes that we should be very militarily aggressive against, say, terrorist groups [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=711.38s)]
*  that actually want to attack the United States or have done so, or American assets or American [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=715.86s)]
*  interests around the world. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=719.94s)]
*  Her argument is that we should not be involved in regime change wars of the kind we did in [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=721.1s)]
*  Iraq, that she fought in, of the kind we did in Syria, of the kind we did in Libya, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=724.86s)]
*  of the kind that we did in Ukraine in 2014 when we actually engineered a coup on the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=729.02s)]
*  most sensitive part of the Russian border. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=733.9s)]
*  Of the kind that we're trying to pull off in Russia right now. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=734.9s)]
*  The point of this is to knock out Putin. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=736.98s)]
*  Yeah, to weaken that regime. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=738.9s)]
*  The thing is, though, that what you said about Putin is so important, which is Putin's critics, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=741.66s)]
*  he doesn't have very many liberal critics, meaning people to his left. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=747.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=750.14s)]
*  His real critics are hardcore nationalists. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=751.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=753.02s)]
*  This is a Putin ... [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=754.18s)]
*  Who see him as a liberal. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=755.18s)]
*  Who see him as weak or insufficiently militaristic when it comes to confronting the West, but [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=756.18s)]
*  it's particularly on Ukraine. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=759.8199999999999s)]
*  They wanted a destruction of Ukraine. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=762.66s)]
*  A lot of them are enraged. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=764.5s)]
*  As you say, the Russian government has taken the position, warned the United States government [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=766.34s)]
*  privately and publicly, that any use of these missiles involving, as they do, direct US [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=771.5s)]
*  or NATO involvement in their launching against Russia will be seen as the entrance of the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=780.34s)]
*  United States and NATO as belligerents in this war, as a war against Russia, as World [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=784.66s)]
*  War III. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=788.7s)]
*  He will have to treat it as such, even though he's been very constrained, even though he [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=789.7s)]
*  clearly doesn't want a broader war. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=793.22s)]
*  There are a lot of people inside Moscow who do wield a lot of power who do, and who will [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=796.38s)]
*  demand that he treat it as such. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=800.5s)]
*  Why wouldn't they? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  We are attacking Russia. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=804.38s)]
*  We're shooting missiles inside Russia. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=805.58s)]
*  I think, as you've said, I don't think we can say it enough, so much of this has been [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=808.22s)]
*  conducted in bad faith, but also so much of that bad faith has been informed by ignorance [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=813.4200000000001s)]
*  or uninformed by ignorance, not informed at all. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=816.94s)]
*  I think that people really think that Putin is an absolute dictator who can do whatever [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=819.82s)]
*  he wants. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=822.94s)]
*  That is not the case. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=823.94s)]
*  It's not the case. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=824.94s)]
*  Super complex place. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=825.94s)]
*  A lot of smart people in Russia. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=826.94s)]
*  Complicated political situation. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=827.94s)]
*  I agree completely. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=829.34s)]
*  We're pushing him toward that. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=831.1800000000001s)]
*  I think, I know, from Putin is that Blinken is driving this, and that Blinken has a lot [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=833.7s)]
*  of hostility. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=840.1s)]
*  It is reckless, but has a lot of hostility toward Russia that has nothing to do with [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=841.1s)]
*  the United States at all. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=844.4200000000001s)]
*  Do you think that's true? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=847.38s)]
*  Do you think Blinken is driving this? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=848.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=849.38s)]
*  I think Blinken, Jake Sullivan, that's kind of the brain trust as it is. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=850.38s)]
*  Obviously, Joe Biden has no involvement in this whatsoever, which I think has been an [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=856.86s)]
*  issue which we've shockingly ignored. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=862.5s)]
*  Everyone saw what Joe Biden was long before that debate. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=866.26s)]
*  Everyone knew it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=870.42s)]
*  The only people who didn't say so were the media and Democratic allies. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=871.42s)]
*  After the debate, it became untenable for them to deny it any longer that this is an [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=875.26s)]
*  old man who has lost his cognitive capabilities. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=878.7s)]
*  Yet he's still the sitting president of the United States, and you had the vice president, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=883.38s)]
*  doing nothing for the last four months other than working on her own empowerment through [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=888.98s)]
*  the campaign. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=893.4200000000001s)]
*  She obviously wasn't involved ever in any decision making, let alone when she became [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=894.4200000000001s)]
*  the nominee. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=898.22s)]
*  So the question has been all these consequential decisions we made, deploying massive military [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=899.22s)]
*  assets to the Middle East, making declarations about when we would go to war in the Middle [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=903.26s)]
*  East and for whom, escalating the war in Ukraine, now authorizing the use of these long range [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=906.3000000000001s)]
*  missiles. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=911.74s)]
*  He's obviously not coming from Joe Biden. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=912.74s)]
*  He barely understands where he is. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=913.78s)]
*  It's not a character flaw in his part, but it's just a disability, a clear disability. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=916.82s)]
*  He's obviously not making any of these decisions. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=921.58s)]
*  I do think that if you look at the national security crowd that emerged from the Obama [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=924.22s)]
*  presidency, especially the people who were associated with the State Department run by [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=930.94s)]
*  Hillary Clinton and then John Kerry, even before Russiagate in 2016, they had an obsession [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=934.96s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=940.1800000000001s)]
*  In fact, when Hillary Clinton left the administration as secretary of state and wrote her book, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=941.3800000000001s)]
*  The Hard Choices, the only areas in which she was critical of Obama was her view that [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=946.78s)]
*  he wasn't willing to confront Russia sufficiently. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=951.18s)]
*  Obama had this view, sort of this realist view from Brent Scowcroft, those are the kind [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=953.8599999999999s)]
*  of people who like Jim Baker, that why would we send lethal arms to Ukraine and provoke [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=957.8599999999999s)]
*  Russia? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=964.8199999999999s)]
*  Ukraine is not a vital interest to us, but it is to them. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=965.8199999999999s)]
*  He wanted to work with Russia and did to facilitate the Iran deal, to bomb terrorist targets in [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=968.1999999999999s)]
*  Syria. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=972.9s)]
*  There was a faction in the Obama administration led by Hillary Clinton, Blinken was there, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=974.38s)]
*  all these sort of national security people woven into the, you know, that Victoria Nuland [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=979.74s)]
*  was hired by Hillary Clinton, that's how she made her way into the Obama administration. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=984.52s)]
*  They viewed Russia as this grave menace. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=988.46s)]
*  The reason Putin hated Hillary Clinton was because when Hillary Clinton was secretary [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=991.7800000000001s)]
*  of state, the United States openly spent millions of dollars funding opposition groups and organizing [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  protests in Moscow. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1004.06s)]
*  I mean, we talk about Putin interfering in our sacred politics and our internal affairs. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1005.4599999999999s)]
*  Hillary Clinton was openly funding protests and anti-Putin agitators inside Russia in [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1011.2199999999999s)]
*  the 2010 election, in 2012, 2011 rather, and they were obsessed with Russia well before [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1020.66s)]
*  that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1028.1799999999998s)]
*  I do think that Russia is disliked by a lot of people in Washington because of the perception [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1029.5s)]
*  that they are detrimental to our interest in the Middle East and especially to Israel's [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1035.74s)]
*  interest in the Middle East, including their support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1040.48s)]
*  fact that they have a good relationship with Iran. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1045.0600000000002s)]
*  It doesn't really always have a lot to do with the United States, but with the interest [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1048.54s)]
*  of other countries as well. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1052.16s)]
*  So you think that's the prime mover here? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1053.5800000000002s)]
*  Because it is true that Assad is only there because of Russia. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1056.46s)]
*  I think that's a fair statement. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1059.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's their ally in the Middle East and has been their ally in the Middle East [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1060.7s)]
*  for decades. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1064.02s)]
*  And just like we support our allies around the world, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, very [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1065.02s)]
*  savage, brutal dictatorships, but at least to do our bidding, the Russians have theirs [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1070.42s)]
*  as well. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1074.5s)]
*  They have a long-term relationship with Venezuela, with Cuba, going back to the Cold War and [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1075.5s)]
*  still do, as well as with Syria. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1077.74s)]
*  And yeah, the Russians operate in Syria. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1080.3400000000001s)]
*  They protect Assad in Syria. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1082.78s)]
*  And as a result, they end up being antagonistic to Israel, which ends up being defined as [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1084.7s)]
*  US interests as well. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1090.98s)]
*  Like there's no separation between two countries. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1091.98s)]
*  So but strictly speaking, this has kind of nothing to do with us whatsoever. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1092.98s)]
*  I mean, I honestly have for the past... [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1096.22s)]
*  Unless you see Israel as a part of the United States. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1098.78s)]
*  You know, I'm not hostile toward Israel, but I think it's a separate country. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1102.26s)]
*  It seems to me to be a separate country as well. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1104.6200000000001s)]
*  It's often not treated as that. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1106.46s)]
*  I'm just saying, but... [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1107.5800000000002s)]
*  Don't pay taxes there. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1108.5800000000002s)]
*  I wasn't born there. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1109.5800000000002s)]
*  Just from an American perspective, without wishing ill in any other country at all, and [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1111.54s)]
*  I really don't, I have been struggling for really since the 2016 election, but particularly [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1116.06s)]
*  since the war began in February of 2022 to identify what exactly would be the US interest [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1121.6999999999998s)]
*  in this. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1126.1399999999999s)]
*  And I just can't. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1127.82s)]
*  And I've really, I think, tried hard. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1128.82s)]
*  But I just don't see what's in it for us at all. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1131.1s)]
*  Tauqa, there is nobody, I'm certain of this, in the United States, just an average, ordinary [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1133.6599999999999s)]
*  American voter who believes that their life is affected in any way by the question of [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1140.1s)]
*  who rules various provinces in the Donbass, in eastern Ukraine. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1145.7s)]
*  Nobody thinks about Ukraine, let alone the Donbass, let alone eastern Ukraine. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1150.3s)]
*  It's an incredibly complex situation there in terms of the people's allegiances, which [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1154.6599999999999s)]
*  are far closer to Moscow than they are to Kiev. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1160.1399999999999s)]
*  The question of what that territory should be, should it be semi-autonomous? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1163.2s)]
*  Should it be used as a buffer against the West? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1167.5s)]
*  The whole framework, as you all know, and as other people have pointed out, when Russia [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1170.26s)]
*  agreed to the reunification of Germany, which was obviously an extraordinary thing for the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1174.74s)]
*  Russians to agree to, given the Russian history in the 20th century with respect to Germany, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1179.4599999999998s)]
*  when they opened the Berlin Wall Fallen, they allowed the eastern and the western parts [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1183.82s)]
*  of Germany to reunite and to become part of the West and become part of the EU. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1188.54s)]
*  The only concession they extracted in exchange for that was, okay, with reunification, NATO's [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1193.1s)]
*  now moving eastward closer to our border, in a country that has devastated our country [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1199.2s)]
*  twice in two world wars, invaded Russia twice, killed tens of millions of Russian citizens. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1205.4s)]
*  The only thing we need as a security guarantee in exchange for allowing that is that NATO [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1211.04s)]
*  will never expand one inch eastward beyond what was East Germany, and the United States [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1214.76s)]
*  agreed to that. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1220.16s)]
*  And immediately, in the 90s, under the Clinton administration, the Clinton administration [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1221.16s)]
*  started talking about it and implementing NATO expansion eastward toward Russia, exactly [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1224.84s)]
*  what was promised to Gorbachev the United States would not do in exchange for them agreeing [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1229.6399999999999s)]
*  to reunification. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1232.9599999999998s)]
*  And why? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1235.04s)]
*  Why did we need to expand our influence eastward toward Russia? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1237.1799999999998s)]
*  And now it's not just eastward in general, it's going directly up to the Russian border [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1241.04s)]
*  on the part of their border that has been invaded twice in Ukraine to destroy Russia [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1245.1s)]
*  in both of those world wars. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1250.9199999999998s)]
*  We also participated in the change of government. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1252.76s)]
*  We removed the democratically elected leader of Ukraine before his constitutional term [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1255.76s)]
*  was expired in 2014, because we perceived him as being too friendly to Moscow, which [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1259.04s)]
*  is what the Ukrainians voted for, and replaced him. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1263.8799999999999s)]
*  Victoria Nuland constructed a government and it was replaced by a government that was more [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1266.48s)]
*  pro-US. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1270.62s)]
*  Imagine if the Russians engineered a coup in Mexico to take out the government because [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1271.62s)]
*  they were too friendly to the US and put in a hardline pro-Russian, anti-American, anti-NATO [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1276.76s)]
*  president. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1282.56s)]
*  Imagine how threatening we would regard that as. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1283.56s)]
*  And that's exactly what we did in Ukraine. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1285.96s)]
*  The question is, though, this has nothing to do with the national security of the American [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1287.46s)]
*  people. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1291.44s)]
*  No American is threatened by who governs Ukraine. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1292.44s)]
*  What they're threatened by is what the United States is doing in Ukraine, including this [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1295.6599999999999s)]
*  most recent act. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1299.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, they keep telling you AI is going to make the world a better place. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1300.3999999999999s)]
*  That may be true, but you have to ask better for whom? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1303.6399999999999s)]
*  Better for your health insurance company, which could use it to calculate exactly how [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1306.7s)]

*  elites are of the prospect of nuclear war? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1409.7199999999998s)]
*  It's unimaginable. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1412.1999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1413.1999999999998s)]
*  I think it can't happen. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1414.1999999999998s)]
*  It won't happen. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1415.1999999999998s)]
*  It's not worth thinking about. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1416.1999999999998s)]
*  It's a source of ongoing frustration. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1417.1999999999998s)]
*  I will say the one thing that Trump has said repeatedly over the past, certainly since [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1419.0s)]
*  he left the presidency, four years, that he's received no credit for and should get enormous [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1425.88s)]
*  credit for is that nuclear war is the worst thing. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1430.64s)]
*  He has, of course, been briefed on it as the person who controlled the launch codes. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1433.68s)]
*  He knows what it means. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1438.0800000000002s)]
*  And anyone who spends five minutes looking into what a nuclear exchange would actually [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1439.92s)]
*  do is terrified of it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1447.28s)]
*  But only Trump seems worried about it. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1449.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't understand why. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1451.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I've said this. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1452.4399999999998s)]
*  I've talked about this so many times. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1453.4399999999998s)]
*  And I think it goes back to when Trump was president in the early stages of presidency. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1455.1599999999999s)]
*  Every time Trump talks about the prospect of nuclear war, he knows that he's limited [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1459.7199999999998s)]
*  in everything he can divulge, but he's so clearly trying to signal, and he often says [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1466.32s)]
*  it, these weapons are of a different universe than even the ones we dropped in Japan. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1471.28s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1475.28s)]
*  He's obviously, as you said, understands and been briefed on. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1476.76s)]
*  But you see these morons at the Atlantic Council or AEI or HUD Center, this cluster of the [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1479.16s)]
*  dumbest people in the world, all implicated in the Iraq disaster, say, well, maybe tactical [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1483.76s)]
*  nukes are fine. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1489.3200000000002s)]
*  That we can change. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1490.3200000000002s)]
*  That's like such next level crazy. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1491.3200000000002s)]
*  That's crazier than any schizophrenic sitting next to you on a public subway. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1493.96s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1497.48s)]
*  I mean, we constantly call RFK Jr. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1498.48s)]
*  They call him crazy. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1501.04s)]
*  They call Tulsi Gabbard or Matt Gaetz crazy, whoever. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1502.04s)]
*  These people who have been in power, who have been generating American orthodoxy, especially [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1505.76s)]
*  in foreign policy, are the most insane people on the planet. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1510.28s)]
*  It's because the United States has been the most powerful country in the world. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1514.44s)]
*  No one could constrain it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1518.4s)]
*  No one could stand up to it. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1519.4s)]
*  And as is true with everything, that level of unconstrained power corrupts people. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1521.24s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1525.56s)]
*  And these people have been in control of this power for decades. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1526.56s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1529.44s)]
*  Passed on one to another through this dogma that gets increasingly out of touch and detached [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1530.44s)]
*  from reality. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1535.52s)]
*  Megalomaniacal. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1536.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1537.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1538.52s)]
*  I mean, at least during the Cold War, I'm not saying it was a good thing, but the Soviet [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1539.52s)]
*  Union and the United States were of equal power. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1543.52s)]
*  They were competing with one another. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1545.16s)]
*  They were both very constrained in what they were. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1546.32s)]
*  They both were petrified of a nuclear war. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1548.6s)]
*  We almost came to nuclear apocalypse at least twice, especially in the Cuban Missile Crisis [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1550.36s)]
*  through misperception and miscommunication when a Russian commander of a submarine thought [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1555.76s)]
*  incorrectly that they were using nuclear weapons against the submarine and against Cuba and [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1560.1s)]
*  almost launched the nuclear weapons at the sub. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1564.74s)]
*  Came about five minutes away from doing so until someone intervened on that sub and said, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1567.14s)]
*  I don't think that this is actually an attack. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1570.34s)]
*  It's very possible. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1573.18s)]
*  We've come to the brink of it before. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1574.18s)]
*  It probably is the single greatest threat to the survival of the species. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1577.42s)]
*  Not probably. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1582.1200000000001s)]
*  It definitely is the use of nuclear weapons. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1583.1200000000001s)]
*  Every time Trump talks about it, you can see the fear that he has. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1585.3s)]
*  He's trying to convey to others. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1588.5s)]
*  Every time. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1590.06s)]
*  Tucker, I'm amazed. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1591.98s)]
*  This is like impeachment level stuff for Joe Biden on his way out of the door to involve [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1596.3799999999999s)]
*  the US directly in a war for the first time. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1603.1799999999998s)]
*  We've been very involved in other ways. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1605.46s)]
*  They should impeach him. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1607.06s)]
*  Why doesn't the Speaker of the House impeach him right now? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1608.34s)]
*  There's a constitutional limitation on the President's ability to involve the US in a [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1609.34s)]
*  war without congressional authorization, which is exactly what has happened through the use [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1613.74s)]
*  of these missiles, which as I said, we need to help direct. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1617.96s)]
*  And the question is, yeah, why? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1621.28s)]
*  The answer though is that the vast majority of the Republican caucus in the House and [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1623.24s)]
*  in the Senate supports what Joe Biden is doing, thinks he should have done this a year ago. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1626.8s)]
*  And there's probably not a lot of anger in the House and Senate over this, except the [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1632.52s)]
*  question that it's called lame duck for a reason. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1638.6000000000001s)]
*  A lame duck is supposed to be a duck that really doesn't do much, can't do much, doesn't [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1641.76s)]
*  move much. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1645.68s)]
*  By design, pretty limited. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1647.28s)]
*  It's like this transition period. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1648.28s)]
*  Yeah, he's floating in the water because he's been shot. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1649.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1651.64s)]
*  His legs are broken. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1652.64s)]
*  And so he's lame. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1654.14s)]
*  This is not a lame duck decision. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1657.1200000000001s)]
*  And it's not like there was any emergency to it. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1659.52s)]
*  There was no emergency to it. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1663.48s)]
*  They just wanted to escalate it because they thought Trump wouldn't. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1664.5600000000002s)]
*  And so they did. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1667.48s)]
*  He puts us in this remarkable moment where the only adult is Vladimir Putin. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1671.36s)]
*  This person we've been told is Hitler and deranged, crazy, dying of nine different kinds [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1676.9199999999998s)]
*  of cancer, can't be trusted. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1682.26s)]
*  Like the only reason we're not, I mean, we're all relying on his restraint. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1684.84s)]
*  That's just a fact right now. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1689.12s)]
*  How weird is that? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1691.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, first of all, this is what amazes me is that sometimes propaganda is, you have [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1692.36s)]
*  to respect it. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1699.3999999999999s)]
*  It's a very potent field of human knowledge that has been refined over many decades using [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1700.44s)]
*  every field of discipline, social sciences and psychology and psychiatry. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1705.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, propaganda is not just some intuitive thing that people do. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1708.96s)]
*  It's an argument that you make. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1713.8000000000002s)]
*  And it's very powerful. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1716.24s)]
*  And we love to talk about how propagandized the Russians are and the Chinese are and how [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1718.24s)]
*  there's no dissent allowed. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1723.8000000000002s)]
*  George Orwell in the preface to Animal Farm wrote, actually to 1984, wrote an essay where [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1728.28s)]
*  he was essentially saying that overt totalitarianism of the kind that was taking place in the Soviet [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1735.6s)]
*  Union is repressive, but it's not nearly as effective as subtle repression, the kind where [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1741.56s)]
*  you give the illusion that people are free, but in reality, the flow of information is [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1748.6s)]
*  heavily controlled because at least when the guys dressed in black with weapons come and [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1752.9199999999998s)]
*  take you and put you in a gulag for criticizing the government, everybody understands the [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1757.58s)]
*  level of oppression. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1761.38s)]
*  It often generates a backlash. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1762.38s)]
*  But when you combine repression with the illusion of freedom, that's what's incredibly effective. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1763.68s)]
*  And that's what we have. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1768.54s)]
*  And you tell people with an abundant consumer economy, like, you know, here are your edibles. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1769.54s)]
*  Here's your Netflix comedown. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1774.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1775.6200000000001s)]
*  And you can basically get them to do anything. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1776.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1778.98s)]
*  And at the same time, there has been a concerted effort to control what was supposed to be [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1779.98s)]
*  the one innovation that was going to break the centralized control of information, which [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1783.18s)]
*  is the Internet. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1788.38s)]
*  That's why there's so much attention and energy. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1789.38s)]
*  It's why it's the number one priority of Western power centers to control the Internet, because [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1791.3s)]
*  it's the one threat to their ability to maintain this propaganda is to control. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1795.02s)]
*  You know, I still can't believe this, that it's not talked about as much, but right after [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1799.9s)]
*  Russia invaded Ukraine and Western governments decided they wanted full on support for Ukraine [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1805.02s)]
*  this very simple minded narrative that they fed their public. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1810.5s)]
*  After they started the war, when the Biden administration started, that's my view of [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1814.78s)]
*  it. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1817.58s)]
*  They knew that Russia would invade if they publicly pushed Zelensky to join NATO. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1818.58s)]
*  So they did that. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1823.42s)]
*  Kamala Harris did it and Russia did it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1824.42s)]
*  My view is they started this war. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1825.88s)]
*  And threat talking openly about expanding NATO to Ukraine. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1827.46s)]
*  You can find memos from the highest levels of the US government saying if you do that, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1829.78s)]
*  it's not just Putin, it's every political faction in Russia that will see it as a war [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1833.44s)]
*  and they'll invade, they'll annex Crimea and invade Eastern Ukraine. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1837.16s)]
*  Of course, the American government knew that. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1840.72s)]
*  You can show documents where it says that. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1842.16s)]
*  But the EU, the minute that war started in earnest with the Russian army invading, one [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1844.76s)]
*  of the very first steps they took legislatively was to ban the platforming, to criminalize [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1854.0600000000002s)]
*  the platforming of Russian media. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1859.76s)]
*  Like Russia RT and Sputnik, they made it a crime and YouTube immediately pulled it [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1861.88s)]
*  off because they didn't want their citizens hearing any information from the Russian perspective. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1868.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you can hate Russia, you can think Russia is evil, you can think whatever you [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1873.4s)]
*  want about Russia, but why wouldn't you want to hear from the other side? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1876.88s)]
*  You know, the New York Times used to publish all the time, like the speeches of Brezhnev [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1880.72s)]
*  and Yuri Andropov and Khrushchev. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1884.88s)]
*  And you could read what the Russians would say, they would come to the United States, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1890.2s)]
*  they would speak openly. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1892.3600000000001s)]
*  Now it's practically criminalized. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1894.4s)]
*  Putin's speech in February of 2022 to his country, nationally televised there, right [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1897.64s)]
*  before the invasion was absolutely just a remarkable speech, which I, by the way, never [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1904.96s)]
*  got around to even looking at before I got to Moscow and I was like, I'll interview [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1909.8400000000001s)]
*  Putin, I think I should watch that speech. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1912.8400000000001s)]
*  I'd read about it, never watched it. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1913.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think, I mean, you can agree or disagree, you can hate Putin. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1916.8s)]
*  I mean, it's totally fine. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1919.48s)]
*  I don't care how people feel about Putin. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1920.48s)]
*  But most Americans had no idea his thinking in invading Ukraine. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1923.1200000000001s)]
*  Like no idea. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1929.48s)]
*  Why wouldn't people want to know? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1930.8s)]
*  It was just the cartoon version. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1932.56s)]
*  He's an evil Hitlerian figure who wants to reconquest all of Europe the way Hitler did. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1933.8s)]
*  Putin has been in office for 25 years. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1941.3600000000001s)]
*  He has gone through six different American presidents, every single one of them, until [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1943.6200000000001s)]
*  you were not allowed to say it anymore, always said, you meet with Putin, he's incredibly [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1948.34s)]
*  shrewd, he's incredibly smart, you can trust Putin. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1952.98s)]
*  If you do a deal with Putin, you can count on the fact that he will adhere to it. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1955.82s)]
*  Other heads of state still feel that way. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1959.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1961.82s)]
*  Well, American presidents said it all the time, starting with Bill Clinton, that he's [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1962.82s)]
*  rational, that he acts in his self-interest, that he's calculating in terms of, and careful. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1965.82s)]
*  And then suddenly, this is what amazed me propagandistically, is that overnight, everybody [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1970.9s)]
*  was forced to say that Putin invaded Ukraine simply because suddenly he became this psychotic, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1975.72s)]
*  evil Hitler-type figure who just wanted out of the blue. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1981.28s)]
*  They all believed it though. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1983.88s)]
*  A lot of them, the people who screamed at me at airports for being pro-Putin, which [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1984.88s)]
*  of course I've never been pro-Putin, I don't have strong feelings either way, but they [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1988.8s)]
*  really had been convinced, not just by MSNBC and CNN, but by the entire oligarch control [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1992.1200000000001s)]
*  the internet, that anyone who talked about Putin or raised questions about the war was [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=1998.32s)]
*  for Putin. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2003.52s)]
*  That worked. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2004.52s)]
*  The propaganda worked. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2005.52s)]
*  No, a propaganda, talk of propaganda worked, especially nationalistic propaganda because [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2006.52s)]
*  human beings evolved over thousands of years to be tribal. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2011.8s)]
*  We want to feel part of our group. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2014.76s)]
*  We take pride in our group. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2016.08s)]
*  It's why if you're born in America, you say, I'm an American, this is my country, this [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2018.32s)]
*  is what I'm loyal to. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2021.72s)]
*  It comes from these tribalistic instincts. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2023.32s)]
*  It makes sense because we evolved for thousands of years where if you got expelled from your [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2025.32s)]
*  tribe, you would die. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2028.96s)]
*  You needed a tribe in order to survive. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2031.04s)]
*  We're tribalistic animals. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2032.4799999999998s)]
*  So if you appeal to people's tribalism and say, we're the good guys, we're the innocent [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2034.12s)]
*  victims, our enemy are the bad guys, they're evil. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2038.1999999999998s)]
*  That appeals to people's most visceral instincts. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2044.4399999999998s)]
*  And the problem of course is the countervailing punishment, which is the minute you question [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2047.8799999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2052.56s)]
*  From the beginning, I had on my show people like John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt and [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2054.2s)]
*  Jeffrey Sachs. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2059.4s)]
*  And they were all saying from the beginning, there's no possibility that Ukraine can win [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2060.7200000000003s)]
*  this war as NATO has defined it, which means the expulsion of every Russian troop from [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2067.6s)]
*  every inch of Ukrainian soil, just simply on size grounds alone. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2072.04s)]
*  Just basic understanding of history. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2075.44s)]
*  Every one of them, I'm sure I think it happened to you too. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2078.4s)]
*  I know it happened to me, were put on these official lists issued by the Ukrainian government [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2081.1600000000003s)]
*  being pro-Russian propagandists everywhere you went, you get accused of being a Russian [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2084.7599999999998s)]
*  propagandist or some sort of agent of the Kremlin simply by questioning our own government's [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2089.8799999999997s)]
*  propagandistic views or simply trying to understand things from the Russian perspective. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2094.24s)]
*  Like this is, you know, after 9-11, the big question on the minds of all Americans after [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2099.04s)]
*  they were traumatized by this extraordinary assault on our soil designed obviously to [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2106.3999999999996s)]
*  impose as much suffering and killing as possible was obviously they asked like, why do they [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2111.7599999999998s)]
*  want to do that to us? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2118.24s)]
*  Why would people hate us so much that they would devise a scheme as complex and deadly [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2119.24s)]
*  as hijacking planes, passenger planes with box cutters and flying them into major American [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2125.2s)]
*  buildings filled with people? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2132.08s)]
*  Why would they hate us that much? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2133.22s)]
*  And they had to, the government had to give an answer to that question because people [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2135.24s)]
*  obviously wanted to know the answer. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2139.04s)]
*  And that was when David Frum and Cheney and all those people said, they hate us for our [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2140.56s)]
*  freedoms. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2144.4s)]
*  They just can't stand the fact that women are allowed to wear bikinis on the beach and [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2145.4s)]
*  that we have a Congress. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2149.0s)]
*  And it's like, no one ever thought, well, there's like dozens of countries around the [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2150.0s)]
*  world where women get to wear bikinis and have Congresses like in Japan and Korea and [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2153.7599999999998s)]
*  all throughout Latin America and like Scandinavia. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2158.88s)]
*  Why aren't they attacking those places? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2161.4s)]
*  And then Bin Laden wrote a letter in 2002 to the American people saying, here's why [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2163.74s)]
*  there's so much animosity toward the United States. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2168.7999999999997s)]
*  And there was of course some appeal to religion in it. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2171.7999999999997s)]
*  I made the mistake of reading part of that letter on the air at CNN at the time, not [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2173.8799999999997s)]
*  to make a kind of point, but just because super interesting, you know, and 9-11 changed [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2177.72s)]
*  everyone's life very much, including mine, lost a friend that day. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2182.52s)]
*  Like, just like every American who was an adult on 9-11, it was, you felt like it was [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2185.2s)]
*  an event that you participated in or it affected you. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2189.12s)]
*  So I feel like I had every right to read that letter. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2191.3599999999997s)]
*  Like, hey, this is good. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2194.08s)]
*  He's now saying why he did it. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2195.08s)]
*  I almost got pulled off the air for doing that. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2197.24s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2199.16s)]
*  Well, I just want to, I just have to say, not only doesn't that surprise me, a lot of [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2200.16s)]
*  people have forgotten that this happens, but it's actually quite extraordinary. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2205.3599999999997s)]
*  After 9-11, obviously Osama Bin Laden was one of the most important people in the world. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2208.4399999999996s)]
*  He just perpetrated the worst attack on American soil, since Pearl Harbor. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2212.64s)]
*  And a lot of people wanted to interview him or play clips of interviews. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  The United States government called all the network news agencies into the White House [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2221.04s)]
*  and said to them, you should not and cannot show, interview Osama Bin Laden or show any [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2228.2799999999997s)]
*  interviews with him. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2234.24s)]
*  And they invented this excuse as to why, which is that he might put some sort of code in [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2235.64s)]
*  his interviews that signal to sleeper cells inside, like he might like wiggle his ear, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2241.92s)]
*  like Carol Burnett did, or like, you know, raise his eyebrows three times or blanken [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2246.56s)]
*  his worst code in a certain way. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2251.16s)]
*  And the networks all obeyed. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2253.24s)]
*  And the most amazing thing was this letter, which you could go read where he says exactly [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2254.96s)]
*  why all the different ways the United States has brought violence to that region has interfered [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2259.2799999999997s)]
*  in that region. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2263.96s)]
*  Even like our foreign policy is the bottom line. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2264.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2266.24s)]
*  Well, we've been bombing that region and interfering in them, opposing dictatorships on those people [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2267.24s)]
*  for decades specifically to suppress the things they believe in. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2272.0s)]
*  We don't want popular opinion being prevailing in democratically in the Middle East because [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2276.52s)]
*  we don't perceive it in our interest. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2280.88s)]
*  So we've been imposing dictators on them, secular dictators. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2282.04s)]
*  We've been bombing them. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2285.4s)]
*  We've been sanctioning them. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2286.76s)]
*  We've been invading them. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2287.8s)]
*  Of course, we support Israel, which in that region, people view as this grave assault [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2289.2400000000002s)]
*  on the rights of Palestinians. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2294.6800000000003s)]
*  But we put bases in Saudi Arabia, which is the most sacred soil to that religion. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2296.88s)]
*  We imposed a blockade and sanction regime on Iraq, which Madeleine Albright admitted [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2301.4799999999996s)]
*  killed 500,000 children, but nonetheless said it was worth it. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2307.08s)]
*  So we've been so active in that region. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2310.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's the reason they wanted to attack back. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2313.3599999999997s)]
*  That's the reason they kind of had so much support. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2315.3199999999997s)]
*  But they banned Osama bin Laden from being heard, just like the EU banned Russian state [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2317.3199999999997s)]
*  media from being heard, because of course you don't want Americans being exposed to [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2321.8799999999997s)]
*  this. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2325.0s)]
*  And then the amazing thing is that letter, which really didn't get much attention at [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2326.0s)]
*  the time, the only place that existed on the internet was on the Guardian's website. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2330.32s)]
*  And somehow, you know, 22 year olds on TikTok found that letter and they started talking [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2334.6800000000003s)]
*  about it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2340.6800000000003s)]
*  And they were like, oh my God, I was never told this before. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2341.6800000000003s)]
*  He didn't attack us because he hates us for our freedom. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2344.96s)]
*  He says specifically here why they're attacking us. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2346.92s)]
*  And in other words, they were reading a historical document and discussing it, things that you [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2351.0800000000004s)]
*  would want a free citizenry to do. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2354.36s)]
*  But the fear that they were allowed to not only read, but talk about the document with [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2357.12s)]
*  one another was so intense that in 48 hours, they forced TikTok to ban every discussion [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2362.0s)]
*  of that letter, to remove the hashtags, to find it, to take down any posts or accounts [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2368.92s)]
*  that were talking about it. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2373.2s)]
*  And then the Guardian, a news outlet, removed that letter, which had been there for 20 years, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2374.6s)]
*  which was of obvious historical and journalistic importance. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2379.68s)]
*  They removed it from their website because they were too frightened that people were [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2382.2s)]
*  going to be able to read it. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2385.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2387.08s)]
*  Because it prevents the propagandist narrative from being unchallenged. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2388.08s)]
*  And that's the same with Russia and Ukraine. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2392.36s)]
*  That shows you how we think we're so free. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2394.56s)]
*  We hear so much dissent because you have a Republican and Democrat bickering on a cable [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2397.56s)]
*  show about trivial things. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2400.62s)]
*  You're like, oh, look, we have free debates, open debates. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2401.88s)]
*  They don't get to have that in Russia and China. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2404.4s)]
*  But the minute there's information that actually threatens the government, that they fear people [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2406.6s)]
*  understanding, they clamp down on it and suppress it. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2411.32s)]
*  And that's what they did there. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2413.72s)]
*  You wonder why we put up with that. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2415.12s)]
*  You wonder why we put up with a government that continues to keep secret files about [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2416.6s)]
*  9-11. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2421.2799999999997s)]
*  It's been 23 years. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2422.2799999999997s)]
*  What could possibly be the justification for not telling me information that I own and [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2423.6s)]
*  have a right to see, which is what the hell was that? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2428.08s)]
*  And they constantly lecturing people. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2430.72s)]
*  Even the JFK files. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2432.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, especially the JFK file. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2433.4399999999996s)]
*  But much more immediate. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2435.56s)]
*  It was 23 years ago. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2436.56s)]
*  But I mean, we're both adults. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2437.56s)]
*  We remember it very well. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2438.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I lived in Manhattan. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2439.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it was like I was traumatized by that. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2440.8799999999997s)]
*  It was a horrible event. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2442.9599999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2444.0s)]
*  And then a lot happened. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2445.0s)]
*  Our country changed radically because of it. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2446.0s)]
*  To this day, the Patriot Act exists. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2448.2s)]
*  It's never been the same country. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2450.32s)]
*  And in some ways, it was much more successful in its aims than I even want to admit to myself [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2452.0s)]
*  because it's so sad to see what it did to this country. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2457.36s)]
*  But here's the point. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2459.28s)]
*  They're constantly they, meaning the media and the intelligence, which work together, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2460.8s)]
*  as you know, are constantly attacking other people for being conspiracy theorists and [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2466.28s)]
*  crazy and discreating the memory of the 9-11 victims, etc. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2470.72s)]
*  by coming up with explanations that are not authorized. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2473.8399999999997s)]
*  OK, then why don't you just tell us what actually happened? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2476.48s)]
*  Why not just declassify it? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2478.7999999999997s)]
*  What's the answer? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2479.96s)]
*  It's going to jeopardize sources and methods. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2481.56s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2483.48s)]
*  And we all know that's not true. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2484.3199999999997s)]
*  And you know that this, the importance of protecting those secrets, keeping those documents [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2485.3199999999997s)]
*  that might show the truth, not just about 9-11, but JFK. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2491.7599999999998s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2493.88s)]
*  In fact, the whole point of the second impeachment trial, which never made any sense. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2495.6s)]
*  Why would you bring an impeachment trial against the president on his way out the office? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2501.16s)]
*  Was because they were petrified that Trump was going to do certain things in that transition, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2504.56s)]
*  like pardon Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, which he came very close to doing, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2509.44s)]
*  but especially fulfill his promise to declassify things like the JFK files and other national [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2513.04s)]
*  security files that have been kept hidden with no justification from the American public, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2518.0s)]
*  even though it happened decades ago, 9-11, JFK. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2523.52s)]
*  And they told him, if you do that, all the Senate Republicans are going to vote to impeach you. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2526.24s)]
*  You're going to be convicted and ineligible to run ever again. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2531.12s)]
*  That was the sword of Damocles. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2533.52s)]
*  They held over his head precisely to prevent him from bringing transparency to the government [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2534.88s)]
*  and allowing the American people to see what they have a right to know. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2539.52s)]
*  But if your greatest fear is transparency, then you're a criminal. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2542.36s)]
*  I mean, that's basically proof. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2545.56s)]
*  I can't think of a better indicator of behavior than the crazed desire to keep that behavior secret. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2547.8399999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2556.04s)]
*  I want to say something about that, which is, if you think about what a democracy is [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2557.04s)]
*  supposed to be, like what an ideal free society is, whatever you call that, it's supposed [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2562.04s)]
*  to be that everything that public officials do in the name of public power is supposed [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2565.8799999999997s)]
*  to be known to the public, with very few exceptions, right? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2573.3999999999996s)]
*  Like if there's a war and they're planning troop movements, they can keep that secret. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2576.64s)]
*  Yeah, Normandy a week before. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2579.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2581.3199999999997s)]
*  They don't have to tell everyone that they're going to do that. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2582.3199999999997s)]
*  But outside of those very rare exceptions, we're supposed to know everything about what [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2584.68s)]
*  they do. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2587.72s)]
*  Of course. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2588.72s)]
*  Because they're doing it in our name. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2589.72s)]
*  Their own place. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2590.72s)]
*  Yeah, and they're supposed to be accountable to us, but they can't be if we don't know [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2591.72s)]
*  what they're doing. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2592.92s)]
*  Conversely, they're not supposed to know anything about what private citizens do. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2593.92s)]
*  They're supposed to track us or eavesdrop on us or keep dossiers on us or know where [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2598.2799999999997s)]
*  going. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2604.48s)]
*  Unless, again, very rare circumstances. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2605.48s)]
*  We're a criminal. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2606.84s)]
*  There's probable cause to spy on us because they've convinced the court as the Constitution [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2608.12s)]
*  requires that there's probable cause to believe. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2612.88s)]
*  But except in those rare circumstances, that's why they're called public officials and we're [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2615.36s)]
*  called private citizens. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2618.4s)]
*  We're supposed to have privacy. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2619.4s)]
*  They're not. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2620.4s)]
*  They're supposed to have transparency. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2621.4s)]
*  Our society is completely reversed. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2622.94s)]
*  If you're a private citizen, the government knows everything about you. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2625.86s)]
*  They keep all kinds of data on you. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2628.48s)]
*  That was the Snowden reporting. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2630.04s)]
*  Obviously, that's what Edward Snowden revealed was the extent to which we were being surveilled [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2631.6s)]
*  by our own government. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2634.32s)]
*  Conversely, we know almost nothing about what the government ... You know, when I got the [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2635.7599999999998s)]
*  Edward Snowden archive, which was hundreds of thousands, if not more, of top secret documents [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2639.96s)]
*  from the NSA, obviously, what was surprising is what was in them and what they revealed. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2644.6s)]
*  Even more surprising to me was that the documents, so many of these documents, most of these [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2650.08s)]
*  documents that were marked top secret had no interesting information in them at all. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2654.72s)]
*  They just reflexively put ... How to get a parking credential, how to ask your supervisor [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2660.84s)]
*  for a vacation. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2665.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2666.04s)]
*  These were top secret because everything the government does reflexively is kept secret [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2667.04s)]
*  from the public. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2671.28s)]
*  Of course, you have no right to know. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2672.28s)]
*  That's the default. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2673.28s)]
*  You have no right to know. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2674.28s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2675.28s)]
*  So everything is inversed. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2676.28s)]
*  The government knows everything about what we do and we know nothing about what they [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2677.28s)]
*  do. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2679.6s)]
*  I guess I should have known this, that the big pornography sites are controlled by the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2680.6s)]
*  intel agency, save access to the data on those sites. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2683.12s)]
*  The reason that they do, and I think the dating sites too, and the reason that they [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2686.2s)]
*  do, of course, is blackmail. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2690.4399999999996s)]
*  Once you realize that, once you realize that the most embarrassing features of your personal [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2692.8399999999997s)]
*  life are known by people who want to control you, then you're controlled. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2697.12s)]
*  You look at the behavior of some of these people who I know personally, and particularly [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2703.0s)]
*  in the Congress, you're like, why are you doing that? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2706.3999999999996s)]
*  You don't agree with that and you're out there doing it anyway. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2708.24s)]
*  We always imagine that it's just donors, so they're getting paid to do that. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2711.56s)]
*  I think it's more than donors. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2714.64s)]
*  I've seen politicians turn down donors before. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2716.12s)]
*  I've watched it. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2718.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't believe that I'm not doing that. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2719.72s)]
*  I know a lot of people have very safe seats. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2720.72s)]
*  Not everybody is desperate for donors. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2722.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2724.16s)]
*  Can I just give you an example? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2725.16s)]
*  So it's not just the carrot, there's a stick in there. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2726.16s)]
*  I'm not saying this happened here. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2728.24s)]
*  I'm not saying that at all. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2730.2s)]
*  I have no basis for saying it, but I had Mike Johnson on my show about two months before [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2731.3599999999997s)]
*  unexpectedly he became the speaker, when he just became the ninth compromise. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2739.88s)]
*  You had Mike Johnson on your show? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2743.04s)]
*  Yeah, I interviewed Mike Johnson. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2744.72s)]
*  The reason I interviewed Mike Johnson was because ... [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2745.72s)]
*  He would not go on your show now. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2748.64s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2750.7999999999997s)]
*  This is why. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2751.7999999999997s)]
*  This is so interesting. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2753.7599999999998s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2754.7599999999998s)]
*  This is why. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2755.7599999999998s)]
*  Just by chance, I interviewed Mike Johnson. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2756.7599999999998s)]
*  The reason was because Christopher Wray went before a committee on which he sat in the [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2757.7599999999998s)]
*  House and Mike Johnson grilled him about FBI spying, about the involvement of the intelligence [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2764.52s)]
*  communities in our politics about the attempt to censor the internet coming from the intel [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2773.92s)]
*  agencies and he did it with this great kind of intellect, but also this very effective [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2777.7599999999998s)]
*  demeanor and I could just tell that he felt passionately about these issues and then I [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2783.96s)]
*  started following more and more of whatever he was doing and he was almost single-mindedly [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2788.52s)]
*  focused on spying abuses, curbing spying power, curbing censorship. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2791.2599999999998s)]
*  You're blowing my mind. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2795.2799999999997s)]
*  And so we asked him, I said, can you call him on my show? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2797.2s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I'm a big fan of Clans. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2799.2s)]
*  I think the work that he's doing great. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2800.66s)]
*  I'd love to come on. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2801.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2803.16s)]
*  And he came on my show. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2804.16s)]
*  Are you making this up? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2805.16s)]
*  No, go watch the interview. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2806.16s)]
*  I'm hard to shock you are shocking me. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2808.16s)]
*  I had him on my show and after this interview, I was like, I love him. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2809.58s)]
*  One of the reasons, one of the things we spent the most amount of time on was Pfizer reform [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2815.2999999999997s)]
*  and the need for Pfizer reform. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2819.3799999999997s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2820.8199999999997s)]
*  Come on. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2821.8199999999997s)]
*  Come on, Glenn. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2822.8199999999997s)]
*  Doctor, I'm telling you, Pfizer reform was coming up in about three months where they [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2823.8199999999997s)]
*  had to extend the Pfizer law that allows the FBI, the CIA to spy on American citizens, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2828.46s)]
*  without really any reforms. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2833.02s)]
*  And he was determined. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2835.42s)]
*  It was like his big issue. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2836.6200000000003s)]
*  That's why he was on my show. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2837.7000000000003s)]
*  That's why he liked what my work was. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2838.7400000000002s)]
*  He was like, we cannot allow this Pfizer law to be renewed. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2840.2200000000003s)]
*  It is a grave threat to American democracy. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2844.0s)]
*  At the very least, we need massive fundamental reforms. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2846.5s)]
*  I'm totally blown away. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2849.1400000000003s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2850.1400000000003s)]
*  And he's very smart. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2852.54s)]
*  He's like a smart lawyer. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2853.54s)]
*  He's very informed about these issues. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2855.5s)]
*  I walked away super impressed. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2856.7000000000003s)]
*  That is what we spent most of our time on. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2858.1000000000004s)]
*  But also just the- [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2859.38s)]
*  Will you put these clips on the internet? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2860.38s)]
*  No, I know, but will you just post these on social media because you're afraid we're shocking [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2863.1s)]
*  me? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2866.7s)]
*  I did, but I'll do it again because Mike Johnson becomes speaker about two months later. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2867.7s)]
*  I don't mean four years later or two years later, about two months after that, three [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2870.22s)]
*  months at the most, right when the Pfizer law is coming up. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2873.22s)]
*  And I was like, oh, it's so great. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2878.5s)]
*  He was made speaker. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2879.8399999999997s)]
*  There's no way this Pfizer law is getting passed. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2881.18s)]
*  Not only did Mike Johnson say, I'm going to allow the Pfizer renewal to come to the floor [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2884.2999999999997s)]
*  with no reforms, not allowing any reforms. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2889.22s)]
*  He himself said it is urgent that we renew Pfizer without any reforms. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2893.06s)]
*  This is a crucial critical tool for our intelligence agencies. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2897.58s)]
*  And I put that clip everywhere when that happened, showing where just two months earlier- [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2901.46s)]
*  Did you butt them together? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2904.98s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2906.2599999999998s)]
*  I was attacking the shit out of Mike Johnson. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2907.2599999999998s)]
*  And then somebody finally asked him, like, but you've been saying all along for years, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2909.54s)]
*  for the last two years that you vehemently oppose this. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2914.3399999999997s)]
*  And suddenly now you're for it. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2917.2599999999998s)]
*  What changed your mind? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2918.54s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, well, when you're a speaker, you get access to a lot of things. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2919.7s)]
*  And I was taken to this secret room in the CIA and they showed me these very important [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2922.94s)]
*  things and these sensitive documents about how important these powers are and how devastating [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2926.7s)]
*  would be if we put any reforms on them. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2931.62s)]
*  And so I realized that it was wrong when I had believed. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2933.34s)]
*  And now I believe this law has to be passed with no reforms. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2935.98s)]
*  You don't have smart people like that. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2939.3s)]
*  He was already in Congress. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2941.58s)]
*  He had access to classified information, getting briefings, secret briefings. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2942.58s)]
*  You don't have people that invested in position who with one meeting- [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2945.72s)]
*  I can see someone really dumb being affected by that. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2950.8399999999997s)]
*  Like, oh, these guys with big medals on their chest take you to like a secret, super secret [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2953.6s)]
*  room inside the CIA, like with all these locks and codes and things on the wall. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2957.3599999999997s)]
*  And you're all impressed. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2961.04s)]
*  Like, oh my God, I can't challenge this. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2962.04s)]
*  He's a very smart guy. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2963.04s)]
*  I don't believe he changed his mind. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2964.48s)]
*  So the question is, why did he? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2966.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2968.9199999999996s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2969.9199999999996s)]
*  But I know that the person that was on my show two months earlier no longer exists. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2971.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2976.3999999999996s)]
*  I can honestly say that's one of the most shocking things I've heard in a long time [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2977.3999999999996s)]
*  because I didn't- I should also echo what everyone else who's ever met him will say, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2979.7599999999998s)]
*  which is nice guy, you know, not a mean man or anything like that. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2985.8399999999997s)]
*  No, Greg, like he, you know, he adopted kids. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2988.9599999999996s)]
*  He like- [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2991.0s)]
*  Totally, yeah. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2992.0s)]
*  Everything he says about decency, respect for everybody. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2993.0s)]
*  I totally- I was even saying today that he was, you know, with the whole thing about [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=2994.7999999999997s)]
*  the question of whether this new trans lawmaker was going to use the bathrooms. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3000.08s)]
*  He was asked about it and he was just like emphasizing the need for respect and decency [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3003.44s)]
*  and civility even if, you know, things- [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3006.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3008.32s)]
*  And I believe he believes that. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3009.32s)]
*  Of course he does. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3010.6800000000003s)]
*  I believe he is in connection with the like best parts of Christianity and takes them [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3011.6800000000003s)]
*  seriously and conducts himself that way and always has. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3014.4s)]
*  Nothing against Mike Johnson personally, quite the contrary, but to watch that happen was, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3017.48s)]
*  I mean, as skeptical- as cynical as I am. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3022.36s)]
*  I don't even know how to respond because I didn't- I have interviewed Mike Johnson over [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3025.46s)]
*  the years, but he was like some guy from Louisiana or whatever. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3029.28s)]
*  Wasn't paying close attention and it was only after he became speaker on the FISA question [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3031.7599999999998s)]
*  and on the question of funding- [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3036.2799999999997s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3037.7599999999998s)]
*  That was the other thing. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3038.7599999999998s)]
*  Go watch- I talked about that too. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3039.7599999999998s)]
*  He was like, you know, he did say he wasn't at all like, you know, say like Matt Gaetz [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3041.16s)]
*  type or, you know, Tom Massey, like we can't fund that war. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3047.52s)]
*  He wasn't saying that. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3053.9199999999996s)]
*  He was like, we can't let Russia win, but he was still pretty skeptical, but it was [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3054.9199999999996s)]
*  He was really on these questions of FISA and the CIA and the FBI and spying powers and [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3058.7599999999998s)]
*  internet censorship powers where he was passionate and vehement. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3066.7599999999998s)]
*  That's why I had him on. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3070.9199999999996s)]
*  You're making the hair on my arms go up because I agree. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3071.9199999999996s)]
*  Look, I'm not alleging anything because I don't know anything. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3073.9599999999996s)]
*  I didn't even know that he was that invested on precisely the opposite side, but you know, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3076.4399999999996s)]
*  it's made all these things possible and, you know, I had a conversation with him off camera, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3082.24s)]
*  so I probably shouldn't be too detailed about it, but he said something that I thought was [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3087.4s)]
*  like not only nonsensical, but like insane, crazy. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3091.4s)]
*  And it's to make any- it was internally incoherent. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3095.04s)]
*  And he's not stupid, as you said, and I got upset and I was like, that doesn't make any [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3097.92s)]
*  sense at all. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3101.54s)]
*  And he just kind of said, no, it does make sense. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3103.36s)]
*  It does. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3106.88s)]
*  It was like there was no answer. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3107.88s)]
*  It was just like, wow, this is a guy. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3108.88s)]
*  I saw this with Obama too. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3111.08s)]
*  You have to like, especially for people who are kind of new to power, right? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3113.52s)]
*  Like not Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden or Mitch McConnell. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3117.16s)]
*  People have been in these positions for decades. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3121.04s)]
*  Mike Johnson went from a very backbench, a member of Congress to the third in line who [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3123.7999999999997s)]
*  controls the House of Representatives. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3129.3999999999996s)]
*  You can only imagine the intense, just unlimited amount of pressure that comes from multiple [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3132.3999999999996s)]
*  directions to force him to align himself with whatever the agenda is of the people who rule [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3139.68s)]
*  Washington. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3145.3199999999997s)]
*  Same thing happened with Obama. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3146.3199999999997s)]
*  I believed Obama when he talked for two years when running for president about how he's [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3147.6s)]
*  a constitutional law professor, how he believes so much in the core rights of the constitution [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3151.2799999999997s)]
*  like habeas corpus, the right to contest your imprisonment, to have evidence presented against [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3155.8799999999997s)]
*  you at places like Antónimo and elsewhere, how we wanted to uproot the worst abuses of [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3160.72s)]
*  Bush-Shaney-Warren-Terror. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3165.3199999999997s)]
*  Then he gets into office and not only doesn't uproot them, but he starts extending them [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3166.32s)]
*  because again, these generals come, including the ones he likes who went to Princeton, like [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3169.96s)]
*  David Petraeus, you know, the ones who dazzle Obama and give him secret briefings about [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3173.92s)]
*  all the blood that's going to be on his hands if he does any of the changes he spent two [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3178.2000000000003s)]
*  years promising. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3181.32s)]
*  And then suddenly on a dime, he switches and there's a lot of other pressure you can imagine [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3182.32s)]
*  as well, like the stick, as you said. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3186.2000000000003s)]
*  And anyone who thinks that this is, that our intelligence agencies are above these kinds [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3188.92s)]
*  of things, the naivete required to believe that is... [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3194.44s)]
*  Well, they're not above. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3198.0s)]
*  Of course, they've done it. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3199.0s)]
*  This is their currency. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3200.28s)]
*  It's just amazing having spent all this time in Washington with all these people I have [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3202.0s)]
*  just who I know. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3206.96s)]
*  And by the way, in some cases, like Mike Johnson, I like, you can't really reach another conclusion [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3209.08s)]
*  other than there's something very heavy duty going on behind the scenes, like really profound [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3215.52s)]
*  going on. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3219.92s)]
*  I just don't know why no one has ever emerged from the system to say what it is. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3221.52s)]
*  Is there not one, there are very few courageous people. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3226.04s)]
*  You're one of them, but there just aren't many in this world. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3228.84s)]
*  Well, I mean... [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3231.16s)]
*  Why doesn't someone just call these people out? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3232.16s)]
*  One of the things that made Trump so threatening and that continues to make him so threatening [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3234.84s)]
*  is that in a lot of ways, he was pulling the curtain open. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3239.48s)]
*  He is that guy. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3241.96s)]
*  It's the fourth wall is coming down. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3242.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3243.96s)]
*  I remember he just said openly, yeah, like as a billionaire, as a businessman, I just [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3245.68s)]
*  gave a candidate $50,000 and then they would automatically accept my call and do whatever [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3253.4s)]
*  I told them to do. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3258.36s)]
*  Who says that in the top level politics? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3260.56s)]
*  Like, hey, you're running for president. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3262.7200000000003s)]
*  I want you to know, here's how the system works. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3263.7200000000003s)]
*  You give a lot of money to some place that these lawmakers tell you to donate money to [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3266.18s)]
*  and then they do whatever you want. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3272.0s)]
*  They do your bidding. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3273.12s)]
*  In that 2016 debate, when he started rallying against the evil and the stupidity of the [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3275.84s)]
*  Iraq war because his principal opponent at the time was Jeb Bush, who was backed by the [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3282.08s)]
*  establishment and the audience started booing as though America was rising up in defense [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3286.32s)]
*  of the Bush family. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3291.6200000000003s)]
*  He was like, oh, these seats here, these are all the big Republican donors. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3292.6200000000003s)]
*  That's the only people who are booing me because they're supporting Jeb Bush. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3296.6200000000003s)]
*  If you ever been to a debate, as I know you have, that's exactly how it is. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3299.88s)]
*  Both parties, they put their big donors, the partisans right behind where their audience [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3304.2400000000002s)]
*  hears only their reaction. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3309.1200000000003s)]
*  So Trump constantly was sort of doing that. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3311.04s)]
*  Here's how things really work. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3315.4s)]
*  And then once he started getting targeted by these agencies, by the CIA, the FBI, starting [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3316.44s)]
*  with Russia Gate, but the Steele dossier, what Jim Comey did, leaking out to the media, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3322.1200000000003s)]
*  and then all those investigations, that's why he started saying these intelligence [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3327.04s)]
*  agencies are corrupted to their core. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3331.46s)]
*  They're filled with people who have their own politicized agenda. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3334.38s)]
*  They were supposed to have an elected leader, democratically elected leader who supervises [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3337.1400000000003s)]
*  these branches and these agencies and the executive branch and their duty is to carry [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3341.5s)]
*  out his policies, but they don't. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3344.82s)]
*  They subverted his policies. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3347.1000000000004s)]
*  They sabotaged them because they didn't agree with them. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3348.42s)]
*  They were like their own branch of government, completely powerful. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3350.7000000000003s)]
*  And he's the first one, I guess since Dwight Eisenhower, who tried to warn of this on his [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3353.9s)]
*  way out after spending eight years and obviously the intelligence community and military industrial [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3357.98s)]
*  companies was way smaller. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3362.46s)]
*  When Dwight Eisenhower tried to warn of how much of a threat it was to democracy in his [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3364.18s)]
*  farewell address, it was before Vietnam, before the real buildup of the Cold War, obviously [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3367.38s)]
*  before 9-11. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3372.78s)]
*  They're sprawling now. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3373.78s)]
*  They're almost impossible to even analyze or quantify. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3375.26s)]
*  And Trump is the only one who's trying to say these institutions are radically corrupted. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3379.9s)]
*  At their root, they're rotted. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3385.38s)]
*  And that's why he's trying to choose people. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3387.5s)]
*  You know, he picked some like comfortable institutionalists and status quo perpetuators [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3389.78s)]
*  like Marco Rubio, Lee Stefanik, John Ratcliffe, people like that just to give Washington a [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3393.7400000000002s)]
*  sense of, okay, there's some people here we're good with. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3398.78s)]
*  But then the people that he picked who share his view that these institutions require radical [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3401.54s)]
*  overhaul, they're just undemocratic, unaccountable, those are the ones they're trying to destroy. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3407.7400000000002s)]
*  There's Tulsi, there's Matt Gaetz, there's RFK Jr. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3412.9399999999996s)]
*  And a little bit to some extent, Pete Hegsath. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3417.7s)]
*  I mean, he's not really ideologically unaligned. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3419.98s)]
*  But the problem is that he doesn't come from the Pentagon bureaucracy. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3424.46s)]
*  That's what they care about most. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3427.74s)]
*  That's a trillion dollar agency. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3428.74s)]
*  You know how many wheels that greases in Raytheon and Boeing and General Dynamics? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3429.74s)]
*  That's what they care about most is making sure that money goes where it's supposed to [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3435.62s)]
*  go. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3438.62s)]
*  That's why they're concerned about him. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3439.62s)]
*  People who aren't the ones that Kamal could have picked easily are the ones who they're [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3440.62s)]
*  most out to destroy because that's what these permanent power factions are, is they are [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3446.7799999999997s)]
*  their own government and they wield the most power. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3451.3399999999997s)]
*  And they have, sure, considered Mike Johnson, no threat at all. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3454.14s)]
*  Let's take them and do what we have to do. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3457.94s)]
*  But you wonder, like just, I don't know. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3459.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, look, these guys are under pressure that we probably can't imagine. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3462.9s)]
*  If somebody knew the thing you were most embarrassed about that would destroy your [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3469.16s)]
*  life and make your kids not like you or whatever. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3472.6s)]
*  I'm not speaking of Johnson specifically, but I know a couple of people who I know are [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3474.3999999999996s)]
*  compromised in the US government and I sort of feel sad for them because how'd you like [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3479.04s)]
*  to be in that position? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3483.0s)]
*  But it does, all it would take is one brave man to give a press conference. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3484.04s)]
*  There was actually a guy, Cokie Roberts's father, Hale Boggs, who stood up in Congress. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3490.3599999999997s)]
*  He was this majority leader in about 1970. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3496.44s)]
*  He was on the Warren Commission and he did not buy the conclusions at all. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3499.04s)]
*  He told other people that. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3503.96s)]
*  He was from Louisiana. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3504.96s)]
*  He stood up and made some noises on the floor of the House about how the CIA was doing things [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3506.48s)]
*  they were not supposed to do in domestic politics and had unchecked power, et cetera. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3512.56s)]
*  He was immediately denounced as mentally ill, probably an alcoholic. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3515.92s)]
*  And then he disappeared in a plane crash with Begich in 1972 in Alaska. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3520.16s)]
*  The plane was never seen again. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3524.04s)]
*  I'm not saying that he was murdered for that though. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3526.24s)]
*  I would not at all be surprised if he was. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3530.3599999999997s)]
*  But why is he the last guy to say anything like that? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3532.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, because he died in a plane crash and was declared mentally ill. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3536.52s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3539.48s)]
*  I mean, this is the thing is, I remember doing the Snowden reporting when there was all this [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3540.48s)]
*  controversy about government spying on people and the big reaction that I got that had been [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3545.48s)]
*  cultivated for a long time, not just by the government, but by Facebook. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3552.44s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg famously said privacy is an archaic value or whatever. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3555.44s)]
*  Don't worry about privacy anymore. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3559.2400000000002s)]
*  People are saying, I don't have anything to hide. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3560.36s)]
*  I'm not a terrorist. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3563.12s)]
*  I'm not a pedophile. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3564.12s)]
*  I don't care what my government is spying on me. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3565.12s)]
*  And I would always say everybody has things to hide. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3567.0s)]
*  There are things that you don't tell anybody. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3569.96s)]
*  There are things you only tell your psychiatrist, only your spouse, only your best friend, things [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3572.78s)]
*  that you don't want people to know that you're petrified. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3577.32s)]
*  If everybody knew about you, we are private. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3580.52s)]
*  We need, we're social animals. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3583.16s)]
*  We need connection to society and other people. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3584.7599999999998s)]
*  But we also crave privacy. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3587.64s)]
*  Without privacy, we go insane. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3589.4s)]
*  And there's no freedom without privacy. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3590.8s)]
*  None, because that's where dissent and creativity and exploration and rejection of societal mores, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3592.44s)]
*  that's where it resides in the private realm. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3598.0s)]
*  Without that, if you're just being surveilled and watched all the time, that breeds conformity. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3600.84s)]
*  And so everybody needs privacy. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3605.4s)]
*  Everybody values it. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3607.12s)]
*  Everybody has something to hide. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3608.12s)]
*  The ability to surveil people, to know everything about, I think what actually happens is we're [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3611.0s)]
*  so inculcated from birth to have this very idealistic image of our country and our government. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3618.04s)]
*  And in some ways it's valid. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3625.6800000000003s)]
*  Like I think I revere the Constitution. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3627.48s)]
*  I went to school to study it and I went to practice it. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3629.36s)]
*  Like I believe in its values. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3632.7200000000003s)]
*  Like I think it's a genius document. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3634.2000000000003s)]
*  I do too. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3635.6000000000004s)]
*  Comes from the Enlightenment. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3636.6800000000003s)]
*  Just a very intellectually based, philosophically based idea of how it was constructed, very [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3638.3599999999997s)]
*  carefully. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3643.2799999999997s)]
*  And there are things very good about the United States. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3644.2799999999997s)]
*  But if you think that the most powerful country on the planet, the richest and most powerful [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3647.3599999999997s)]
*  country arguably ever to exist, doesn't have at its core in terms of the people who run [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3653.72s)]
*  it, people who are willing to do anything to preserve their power, to augment their [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3658.96s)]
*  power. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3664.2s)]
*  Again, it just takes a kind of naivete that's almost impossible without them. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3665.6s)]
*  People risk death every single day in this country to rob liquor stores for $300. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3668.9199999999996s)]
*  So you can't tell me that control of a trillion dollar federal agency or of a multi-trillion [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3675.3199999999997s)]
*  dollar government with vast nuclear arsenal. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3680.3999999999996s)]
*  Or just the power to decide who gets bombed, where wars start. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3682.8799999999997s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3687.04s)]
*  The most powerful institution in human history. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3688.04s)]
*  Doesn't have sinister things going on. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3691.2799999999997s)]
*  What would people do to control that? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3692.7599999999998s)]
*  No, the stakes are very high. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3694.52s)]
*  And I think the closer you are to it, the more often you forget that. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3696.28s)]
*  You're like, oh, it's just secretary of whatever, who cares? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3700.08s)]
*  Well there's, you know, people care. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3703.04s)]
*  Understandably, people will do anything for power and money. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3705.4s)]
*  Wow, that's so distressing. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3709.32s)]
*  Did you, in your reporting, and I always forget that you were behind the Snowden thing, and [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3711.6800000000003s)]
*  thank you for that. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3717.08s)]
*  What a wonderful guy he is. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3718.08s)]
*  But did you ever get any hint of what the pressure is that's applied to politicians [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3720.92s)]
*  to comply and obey? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3725.84s)]
*  Yeah, well first of all, I do think, like we were just talking about, like people who, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3727.32s)]
*  why don't people stand up? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3731.64s)]
*  Like, Edward Snowden is a perfect example of somebody who believed the mythology of the [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3733.04s)]
*  government, believed in, you know, he went to enlist in order to fight in Iraq. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3738.44s)]
*  He broke both of his legs. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3743.12s)]
*  He couldn't join the military, so he went to work for the CIA and the NSA because he [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3744.12s)]
*  really believed in the. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3747.56s)]
*  And then what he saw was so horrifying, was so corrupting, was so deceitful that he risked [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3748.96s)]
*  his life and his liberty, which to this day he's deprived of, to inform everybody about [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3754.32s)]
*  what was going on by stealing under their nose documents that he could give to reporters [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3760.36s)]
*  so that reporters could tell the world what was happening. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3765.84s)]
*  That is kind of an example of that level of courage of somebody saying, here's what's [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3768.2000000000003s)]
*  going on. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3771.6400000000003s)]
*  What Snowden gave us was a tiny picture of what the NSA does. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3775.0s)]
*  So obviously if there had been in their specific blackmail sort of documents about how they [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3778.84s)]
*  were spying on particular politicians, that's something we would have reported on very aggressively [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3786.2400000000002s)]
*  and very early on. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3791.28s)]
*  So I can't say I saw that, but what I did see is all sorts of incidents of people at [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3792.52s)]
*  the NSA abusing their authority to spy on people who they had no right to be spying [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3799.8s)]
*  on, including sometimes, you know, just things as trivial as like ex-girlfriends or family [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3803.96s)]
*  members. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3808.68s)]
*  But also when in other countries they wanted to impede or harm somebody, they spied on [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3810.8799999999997s)]
*  those people all the time and used that information in part to gain power over them. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3816.72s)]
*  So of course, how can you expect human beings to resist that level of power when it's all [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3821.7999999999997s)]
*  operating in the dark? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3827.16s)]
*  Strong families are built on strong foundations and it all begins with what you bring into [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3828.96s)]
*  your home. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3832.8s)]
*  It's hard though because big pharma and the processed food industry have spent decades [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3833.8s)]
*  putting you and your loved ones at risk pushing toxic, harmful products that make you sick, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3838.52s)]
*  that have made our country sick. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3844.6000000000004s)]
*  It's not a guess, that's happened. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3845.6000000000004s)]
*  So it's well past time that someone decided to help you fight back. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3847.7200000000003s)]
*  Public Square is doing that. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3851.1200000000003s)]
*  Public Square is the leading family marketplace where you will find clean, healthy products [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3853.36s)]
*  sourced from American small businesses that actually share your values. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3857.4s)]
*  On Christmas right around the corner, now is the time to abandon the corporate food [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3862.44s)]
*  conglomerates in favor of something better, healthier, more pure. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3866.32s)]
*  Make the switch, stock your home with the quality essentials and shop for gifts your [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3870.52s)]
*  whole family will love and it's easy. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3873.4s)]
*  Public square.com slash Tucker and you can get started. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3875.92s)]
*  Public square.com slash Tucker. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3878.88s)]
*  So I mean, you can't have anything like representative government with that system in place. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3882.08s)]
*  The whole idea of having a national security apparatus and intelligence community that [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3889.76s)]
*  operates in complete secrecy and that just does what it does permanently without end [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3893.8s)]
*  and constantly expands its authorities and powers because there's no political gain. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3900.6400000000003s)]
*  And its budgets which are classified. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3904.76s)]
*  And its budgets which nobody, you know, that was one of the things we actually weren't [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3906.36s)]
*  able to see was the black book of the intelligence budget. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3910.0s)]
*  And we were putting on the things that, you know, we thought were newsworthy about that. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3913.28s)]
*  There's zero transparency to any of this. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3918.44s)]
*  There's no oversight. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3921.7200000000003s)]
*  You technically have like oversight in Congress and the Senate, the Senate Intelligence Committees, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3922.7200000000003s)]
*  these select committees that were created after the Church Commission found all these, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3927.0s)]
*  you know, what the Church Commission found just by itself, you know, CIA developments [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3930.52s)]
*  of medications to try and like, you know, make people lose control of their brains or [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3935.1600000000003s)]
*  inject people with diseases, like really sinister dark stuff that the CIA was doing that nobody [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3941.08s)]
*  knew about. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3945.84s)]
*  Not even the president. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3946.84s)]
*  They just did it on their own. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3947.84s)]
*  It was a discovery of a secret government inside the government. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3949.2000000000003s)]
*  The idea was we need at least some oversight. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3952.36s)]
*  This oversight, they tell nothing to these committees. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3954.44s)]
*  The people who get put on those committees are people who are the ones who most support [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3958.6800000000003s)]
*  these intelligence committees. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3963.7200000000003s)]
*  It was run in the Senate for years by Dianne Feinstein. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3964.7200000000003s)]
*  Her husband was a military contractor. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3967.84s)]
*  She was embedded in these agencies. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3970.38s)]
*  She defended everything that they did. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3971.8s)]
*  The one time she questioned them, which was when she wanted to investigate the use of [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3973.64s)]
*  torture in the CIA, John Brennan, CIA spied on Dianne Feinstein and on her entire staff. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3979.16s)]
*  He got caught doing it. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3986.18s)]
*  He lied and said he didn't. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3987.2999999999997s)]
*  He finally admitted that it was done. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3988.72s)]
*  He apologized and there were no repercussions. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3990.54s)]
*  Like, let's buy guns. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3992.3199999999997s)]
*  We gotta go Google John Brennan spying on Dianne Feinstein. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3993.3199999999997s)]
*  I'll never forget it. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3996.3599999999997s)]
*  And when that story first broke, it was years ago, it was at least 10 years ago. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=3997.74s)]
*  He was CIA director under Obama. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4001.52s)]
*  And I remember thinking, I don't think the CIA would ever dare spy on the select committee, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4004.12s)]
*  on the Senate Oversight Committee of the CIA, of the intel community. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4009.64s)]
*  I mean, I can't imagine they would have the balls to do something like that. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4012.72s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4016.2s)]
*  But I had no idea. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4017.28s)]
*  And they did it on somebody who was one of their most, their blind disloyalists. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4018.84s)]
*  The one time she stepped a little bit out of line because she wanted to investigate [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4022.84s)]
*  exactly what happened in the torture program. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4027.4s)]
*  So at that point, like, why don't you, why have people put up with that? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4028.8s)]
*  I guess Frank Church did die of incredibly fast acting cancer. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4032.8s)]
*  So maybe that's why. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4037.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, people must be afraid because you'd think out of 435, 535 with the Senate, there [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4039.2000000000003s)]
*  would be somebody who was like, this is not democracy. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4043.5600000000004s)]
*  This is totally immoral. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4046.48s)]
*  Like, I'm going to just stand up and take them on. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4047.48s)]
*  Like, but, but, but Tucker, just, just let's say that, you know, people had things on you [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4049.92s)]
*  that would, as you put it, destroy your reputation, make your kids think very poorly of you, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4056.2000000000003s)]
*  would embarrass you for the rest of your life, would destroy whatever you value in life. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4061.2799999999997s)]
*  It takes a very rare person to say, ah, F it, I'm going to risk that happening. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4067.2799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, I think we have this self preservation tactic. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4074.08s)]
*  That's why those kinds of things like blackmail extortion are so effective is because they [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4079.72s)]
*  can force people to. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4084.7999999999997s)]
*  No, I think, I think you're, you're, you're right. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4086.2s)]
*  So the, the, look at how much these like sexual misconduct allegations are used when Julien [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4090.52s)]
*  Assange really got dangerous, suddenly out of nowhere appeared to women claiming that [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4096.12s)]
*  he quote unquote raped them because the allegation was they had consensual sex with him, but [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4100.56s)]
*  he didn't use a condom when they had not given their consent to no condom. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4105.12s)]
*  And that became rape under Swedish law. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4109.56s)]
*  That's what forced him to the Ecuadorian embassy and led to everything that happened subsequently. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4111.6s)]
*  Now with Matt Gaetz, the minute Matt Gaetz, Pete Hegseth too, like out of nowhere appears [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4115.88s)]
*  this alleged rape that nobody had heard about, that nobody knew about. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4121.4400000000005s)]
*  It's always the thing that always amazes me. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4126.12s)]
*  This is actually the best example in case anybody thinks, oh, our government doesn't [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4129.0s)]
*  do that. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4131.84s)]
*  When Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon papers to the New York times and the Washington post. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4132.96s)]
*  And I remember when I first heard about this, I was kind of confounded about why this happened. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4136.400000000001s)]
*  Obviously they were saying the normal things you say about people like that. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4141.68s)]
*  People like, oh, he's a Soviet asset. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4144.6s)]
*  He hates America. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4146.160000000001s)]
*  He put troops in harm's way because he showed the public that the government was lying for [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4147.160000000001s)]
*  years about the Vietnam war. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4150.96s)]
*  Like inside they were saying we can never win. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4152.120000000001s)]
*  Now externally they were saying we're on the verge of winning. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4153.92s)]
*  But what they also did, and it's the only reason Daniel Ellsberg ended up free, is they [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4156.88s)]
*  broke into his psychoanalyst's office because they wanted to steal all the documents about [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4160.52s)]
*  his most intimate admissions to a psychoanalyst about his psychosexual life and fantasies [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4167.08s)]
*  because that was the weapon of choice that they wanted to use to destroy him. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4175.2s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4179.32s)]
*  The Nixon administration broke into the psychoanalyst's office of Daniel Ellsberg when they couldn't [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4180.32s)]
*  find the documents they planned to break in at the guy's house. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4184.2s)]
*  And that was, they finally put a stop to that, but they did break into a psychoanalyst's [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4188.12s)]
*  office and only because of that government misconduct did the judge dismiss the charges [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4192.08s)]
*  against Daniel Ellsberg, who otherwise was headed to prison for the rest of his life. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4195.68s)]
*  Why would that be a response to a whistleblower revealing to the press that then revealed [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4199.4800000000005s)]
*  to the public that the government was systematically lying about the Vietnam war? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4205.360000000001s)]
*  It's because if you can have that information over somebody and then use it against them, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4208.320000000001s)]
*  you destroy, I remember when it happened with Julian Assange. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4212.240000000001s)]
*  No one wanted anything to do with Julian Assange anymore. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4216.16s)]
*  No one wanted to mention his name. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4218.0s)]
*  It's just like, ooh, this person's guilty of, accused of rape. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4219.12s)]
*  I just don't want anything to do with that. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4222.360000000001s)]
*  So if you could have shown that Daniel Ellsberg had this fantasy or had done this or had done [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4224.68s)]
*  that in the intimacy and privacy of his own life, it just, everybody would have wanted [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4230.0s)]
*  to avoid it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4235.72s)]
*  It's totally, it's totally true. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4236.72s)]
*  Did you ever find yourself on the wrong end of any of that since you were very high profile? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4239.0s)]
*  I mean, I think the important thing is that if you want to confront the government, if [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4245.0s)]
*  you want to spill secrets, if you want to bring unwanted transparency, which happens [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4252.36s)]
*  to be the job of a journalist, I know people forget that, but that is the job of a journalist. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4257.639999999999s)]
*  If you're going to run off what you're supposed to try to do, you have to as best you can [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4261.24s)]
*  guard against that. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4266.44s)]
*  Like you have to protect yourself, make sure that your own house is in order as much as [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4267.44s)]
*  possible because that will be a huge vulnerability. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4272.8s)]
*  But as I said before, everything has, everyone has things to hide. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4276.8s)]
*  There's no one who doesn't. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4280.4s)]
*  Even 100%. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4283.12s)]
*  And it's also true that if you get really attacked in a scary way, you don't want to [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4284.12s)]
*  talk about it. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4292.04s)]
*  I mean, I feel that. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4293.04s)]
*  I've been, that has happened, not sex stuff, but I've definitely felt a lot of pressure [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4294.04s)]
*  and you don't want to talk about it. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4301.04s)]
*  It's not just sex stuff. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4303.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's all sorts of things in our past that we do that we're embarrassed by. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4304.76s)]
*  But did you ever worry the intel agencies would try and hurt you? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4308.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4312.64s)]
*  I mean, here's the thing. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4313.64s)]
*  I think a lot of people remember, but my husband who's now deceased, but at the time he went [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4317.4800000000005s)]
*  to Germany because there was a part of the archive that was corrupted and we knew there [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4323.4s)]
*  was a lot of important doctors there. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4328.16s)]
*  And it was with Laura Poitras and she, using her genius, had figured out how to access [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4330.24s)]
*  it. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4334.68s)]
*  No one else could, but she didn't trust anybody, including the Guardian, to give it to you [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4335.68s)]
*  to bring to me. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4338.4s)]
*  The only person she trusted was David. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4339.4s)]
*  I couldn't travel outside of Brazil because there was a concern that I would be arrested [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4340.6s)]
*  by the US. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4343.84s)]
*  So I had to stay in Brazil. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4344.84s)]
*  So only David could go and get those documents. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4346.240000000001s)]
*  And the way we talked about it was in a very secure, secret way. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4349.4400000000005s)]
*  We were using the highest levels of encryption at the time that Snowden insisted on. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4352.0s)]
*  And when David went to Germany, he came back home through Heathrow. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4356.08s)]
*  But at Heathrow, the British arrested him and detained him and threatened to prosecute him [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4358.68s)]
*  under an anti-terrorism law. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4363.46s)]
*  And the only reason they let him out was because the Brazilian government, it became a huge [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4365.740000000001s)]
*  story in Brazil. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4369.08s)]
*  The Brazilian government was like, give us back our citizen immediately. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4370.5599999999995s)]
*  And so they let him go. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4373.36s)]
*  And then David sued the British government over human rights abuses because they were [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4374.5199999999995s)]
*  detaining him for journalism. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4378.68s)]
*  And the British government said in their papers, when they defended their actions, we knew [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4380.28s)]
*  exactly what he was doing in Germany. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4384.76s)]
*  We knew exactly what he was carrying. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4386.62s)]
*  And that's the reason why we detained him because we wanted to prevent these secret [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4388.34s)]
*  documents from getting out into the public because it harms British national security. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4391.44s)]
*  Now, obviously, we got the archive anyway, and we reported on those documents. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4395.48s)]
*  They admitted they knew and were listening to our conversations about why he was going [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4399.799999999999s)]
*  there. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4404.919999999999s)]
*  They knew when he was going there. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4405.919999999999s)]
*  Everything was being tracked. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4406.919999999999s)]
*  And so when you know... [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4407.919999999999s)]
*  Did you ever figure out how? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4408.919999999999s)]
*  I knew they were using... [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4411.16s)]
*  I mean, part of the reporting that we did was that the NSA had cracked even the most [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4412.16s)]
*  sophisticated levels of encryption. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4416.5199999999995s)]
*  So things that people thought were safe. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4418.919999999999s)]
*  There's nothing 100% foolproof. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4422.2s)]
*  And at the time, we were among the most watched people in the world because we had in our [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4423.919999999999s)]
*  hands the most sensitive secrets from the world's most powerful government that we were [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4428.08s)]
*  going around the world publishing to inform people of. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4430.8s)]
*  Journalistically. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4434.6s)]
*  And so of course, we knew we were being spied on by probably a lot of people. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4435.88s)]
*  It's just the British were forced to admit it. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4439.68s)]
*  And when you get that confirmation as opposed to like a belief or suspicion, the level of [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4441.320000000001s)]
*  invasiveness you feel is hard to express because they're not just listening to the parts of [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4447.360000000001s)]
*  your conversations where you're talking about the Snowden documents. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4452.56s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4455.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, I hear that. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4456.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, I know firsthand. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4458.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4459.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4460.04s)]
*  I mean, you had private conversations leaked as well when you were trying to interview [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4461.04s)]
*  President Putin. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4463.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4464.04s)]
*  We got followed and had massive problems with Ukrainian Intel Service, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4465.04s)]
*  It's not about me. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4471.759999999999s)]
*  I don't hold any institutional power. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4472.759999999999s)]
*  It's just interesting if you see what happens in your own life just by talking about it. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4474.24s)]
*  I haven't done anything ever. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4478.0s)]
*  Just sit around the studio, talk to people. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4480.4s)]
*  But you see the pressure they apply to you. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4482.679999999999s)]
*  What would it be like to be the chairman of the Intel committee or the Speaker of the [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4484.72s)]
*  House or the President of the United States? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4488.200000000001s)]
*  I can't even imagine. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4490.4400000000005s)]
*  And it just shows you what a remarkable person Trump is. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4492.64s)]
*  He's weirdly resistant to that stuff. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4495.8s)]
*  And that's why they hate him. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4499.080000000001s)]
*  I mean, remember all the stuff that came out in 2016 when they thought he might win, like [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4500.080000000001s)]
*  the Access Hollywood tape that came out of nowhere and the Stormy Daniels stuff? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4503.360000000001s)]
*  They threw everything out there. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4509.92s)]
*  And Trump is a very rare person who's just kind of shameless. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4511.76s)]
*  He doesn't feel a sense of shame and he doesn't back down no matter what. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4517.4800000000005s)]
*  He gets more aggressive against people he tried to force him to. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4521.84s)]
*  It's just his instinct. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4524.68s)]
*  The two he is. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4525.68s)]
*  I watched him for many decades when I was a lawyer in New York, when he was a big real [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4526.68s)]
*  estate mogul constantly being sued in lawsuits. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4530.92s)]
*  Everybody knew how he was. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4533.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's what is so threatening about him. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4536.04s)]
*  It's not his ideology or his beliefs or the fact that he's in Russia. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4539.12s)]
*  It's the fact that he's immune. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4542.92s)]
*  Immigration, racism, it's all bullshit. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4543.92s)]
*  No one cares about that. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4546.599999999999s)]
*  No one believes that. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4547.599999999999s)]
*  It's the fact that he's immune to the type of control that for decades they've been able [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4548.599999999999s)]
*  to impose on people who wield any power, let alone the power of the presidency. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4553.12s)]
*  Just type the current state of US-Russia relations or the war that we're about to get. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4562.64s)]
*  How do you think this ends? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4568.48s)]
*  I mean, if you're sitting in Moscow, obviously if there's a barrage of weapons aimed at Moscow, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4569.959999999999s)]
*  St. Petersburg, your major cities, that's one thing. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4579.12s)]
*  If there's a limited number of missiles aimed in Kursk where Ukrainian forces are, that's [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4582.4s)]
*  another. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4588.32s)]
*  And obviously they know what we talked about, which is that in about seven weeks, there's [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4589.32s)]
*  going to be a new American president with whom they've dealt extensively. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4595.48s)]
*  And despite claims that he's some sort of, you know, lackey of Putin, he basically did [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4600.44s)]
*  the two things that were most threatening to Russian interests. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4604.639999999999s)]
*  He sent lethal arms to Ukraine after Obama refused to. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4607.12s)]
*  Trump did. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4611.0s)]
*  I didn't agree with it, but that's what he did. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4612.0s)]
*  And what he did even more so that was more threatening, damaging to Russia is he spent [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4613.66s)]
*  years trying to badger the Europeans out of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4617.419999999999s)]
*  He pressed them on energy. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4621.12s)]
*  He was like, why would you be buying gas from Russia? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4622.12s)]
*  You're getting dependent on Russia and we're the ones who pay for your protection. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4624.72s)]
*  You should be buying it from us. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4627.52s)]
*  That's the, selling natural gas to Europe was the anchor, the key to Russian vital interests [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4629.52s)]
*  and Trump threatened those vital interests continuously. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4635.320000000001s)]
*  So the idea, like anyone who's even a little bit rationally thinking would understand that [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4637.8s)]
*  this claim that he's being blackmailed by Putin while at the same time he's simultaneously [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4641.76s)]
*  doing the two most threatening things to Russian vital national interests, you would immediately [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4645.8s)]
*  recognize what a fictitious claim that was. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4649.62s)]
*  He's being blackmailed by the US intelligence agencies and in fact, our government is the [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4652.48s)]
*  fascist state that they claim Russia is. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4656.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4658.28s)]
*  So, and that's not just that Russia's not dressing, but so I think they know that, you [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4659.28s)]
*  know, they obviously know Trump's coming in and they feel like he wants to go in a different [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4664.12s)]
*  direction with the war. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4669.12s)]
*  And so even though there is going to be pressure on Putin, as there would be on the United [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4670.88s)]
*  States and any other country to respond in kind to NATO in the United States now bombing [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4674.54s)]
*  Russia basically, I think as long as it's limited, as long as it stays limited to Kursk, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4680.04s)]
*  as long as it's not, you know, in large numbers, knowing that Trump is coming into office, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4685.76s)]
*  I think they understand that that's an opportunity to try and end this war without its escalation. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4691.48s)]
*  I hope again, as you said, we're depending on Putin's restraint and rationality. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4696.08s)]
*  So is Christmas really about buying stuff? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4701.08s)]
*  You'll be forgiven if you assumed it is because that's the message you receive. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4704.44s)]
*  But most people sense deep down there may be a little bit more to Christmas. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4709.0s)]
*  Maybe this is the time of year to focus on growing your relationship with God. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4713.52s)]
*  Remember, there is a God and reach out to that God. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4717.0s)]
*  Well, to do that, you can check out HALO, the HALO app and its Advent Pray 25 Challenge. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4720.2s)]

*  This Christmas, working on something that matters, your relationship with God, maybe [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4767.08s)]
*  the only thing that matters. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4770.58s)]
*  We hope you will. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4771.58s)]
*  HALO. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4772.58s)]
*  So among the many people Donald Trump has spoken to since winning a week and a half [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4773.58s)]
*  ago is Joe and Mika and Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4779.54s)]
*  They have a very low rated show on MSNBC, which I do think has outsized influence. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4785.52s)]
*  The numbers are really are small. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4790.4800000000005s)]
*  People in Washington watch it. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4792.240000000001s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4793.280000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4794.280000000001s)]
*  So I think the show does have influence. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4796.12s)]
*  I disagree with every single word ever uttered on that show, but I don't think it's totally [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4798.12s)]
*  insignificant. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4801.719999999999s)]
*  It's not Joy Reid. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4802.719999999999s)]
*  So they went to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4804.5599999999995s)]
*  What do you make? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4808.2s)]
*  And then now they're saying, well, we went because we were afraid that we were going [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4810.32s)]
*  to be persecuted if we didn't kiss the ring or something. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4812.719999999999s)]
*  No, their excuse is even more pathetic, which is we're journalists. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4815.92s)]
*  You have to go and talk to the people in power. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4820.08s)]
*  But I think those two in particular are singularly pathetic. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4823.84s)]
*  And I realize saying singularly pathetic in the context of employees of the corporate [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4829.68s)]
*  media seems like a designation that no one deserves alone. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4832.96s)]
*  But I think in their case, they really merit that distinction because I think most of the [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4837.04s)]
*  people who work in corporate media, like the Rachel Maddow's and the Lawrence O'Donnell's [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4843.68s)]
*  and the Donald L. Lemons and those kind of people, I think they believe all the insane [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4847.56s)]
*  unhinged stuff. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4851.96s)]
*  I think they really believe that Trump is a Russian agent, that Putin is blackmailing [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4853.08s)]
*  him, that Trump wants to put them in camps. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4856.84s)]
*  It's insane, but credit for at least actually saying what they really believe is as preposterous [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4859.68s)]
*  and laughable as it is. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4864.92s)]
*  Joe Scarborough has no beliefs other than his own advancement and self-importance. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4867.4s)]
*  Okay, let's remember in the 1990s, he was elected not as a Republican congressman, but [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4871.96s)]
*  as a radical conservative wire. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4877.68s)]
*  The whole new Gingrich, like young firebrands were going to go in and radically change the [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4880.44s)]
*  country and Washington. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4886.679999999999s)]
*  No more of that anywhere in Joe Scarborough, like this radical transformation of institutional [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4889.48s)]
*  power. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4893.08s)]
*  And then as Megyn Kelly said, no show did more to boost Donald Trump in 2015 and 2016 [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4894.08s)]
*  in the Republican primary than Joe and Mika. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4901.28s)]
*  They were down at Mar-a-Lago all the time. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4903.7s)]
*  They loved Trump. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4905.639999999999s)]
*  They were best friends with Trump. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4906.639999999999s)]
*  They laughed with him. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4908.44s)]
*  Called him on their show all the time, in part because it was very beneficial to that [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4909.679999999999s)]
*  show. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4913.28s)]
*  It was the only thing that rated. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4914.28s)]
*  Trump saved all their jobs, but they also loved just being proximate to power like that. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4915.28s)]
*  That's the thing that they crave most. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4921.04s)]
*  And then what really happened was Scarborough thought that he was going to be chosen as [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4922.759999999999s)]
*  Trump's vice president. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4927.599999999999s)]
*  He really wanted to. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4929.099999999999s)]
*  And when Trump rejected him in favor of Mike Pence, and then also MSNBC turned into this [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4930.28s)]
*  fanatical anti-Trump network where the only people who watched were Trump haters, both [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4936.76s)]
*  at a personal affront, but also at a survival, they had to turn into a full on Trump hating [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4942.280000000001s)]
*  show. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4948.52s)]
*  You couldn't have the morning show of three hours be someone positive toward or neutral [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4949.52s)]
*  about Trump when the whole rest of the network, everyone who watched. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4953.56s)]
*  I mean, I just ask you to pause for a second. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4956.240000000001s)]
*  I'm just digesting this. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4957.84s)]
*  Scarborough, who I used to know really well, he thought he was going to be VP. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4959.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4962.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4963.92s)]
*  That's what they remember how closely. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4964.92s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4966.24s)]
*  I didn't know. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4967.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4968.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4969.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4970.24s)]
*  He that's... [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4971.24s)]
*  You should come to the United States more often. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4972.24s)]
*  I learn a lot. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4973.24s)]
*  I think by distance is what enables me to learn things. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4974.24s)]
*  So yeah, that was a big part of it. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4975.24s)]
*  But also it was survival at MSNBC. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4977.8s)]
*  And so they turned into these, Joe Scarborough, Mr. Radical conservative, let's change all [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4980.96s)]
*  of Washington's work, became Mr. Institutionalist. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4985.56s)]
*  The people he had on his show are like Richard Haas and like Norm Ornstein, like all these [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4988.4s)]
*  people on foreign relations and think tanks, people who were obsessed with hating Trump [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4994.08s)]
*  as well. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4998.76s)]
*  And it became grounds Europe for Trumpist Hitler. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=4999.76s)]
*  They were saying as recently as two months ago or a month ago, like Trump is comparable [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5001.64s)]
*  to Adolf Hitler. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5007.76s)]
*  He is a Nazi figure. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5008.76s)]
*  Mika Brzezinski went on the view and cried and said, Trump wants to murder women. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5010.36s)]
*  Women are going to die because of Donald Trump. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5014.0s)]
*  He's a fascist. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5015.84s)]
*  He's a racist. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5016.84s)]
*  They said it every day over and over. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5017.84s)]
*  And then Trump wins. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5019.84s)]
*  And their whole influence was because they were Joe Biden's favorite show. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5021.88s)]
*  Joe Biden would wake up at like 6 a.m. like many geriatrics do because he went to bed [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5024.88s)]
*  at like 7 o'clock p.m. and he would watch Morning Joe. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5029.6s)]
*  And then he would hear, you know, Joe Biden is the greatest president of the art. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5033.2s)]
*  Joe Scarborough said that he personally can assure the country having spent so much time [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5036.56s)]
*  around Joe Biden that he's sharper than ever. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5041.0s)]
*  He runs intellectual circles around all the Republicans were claiming that he's cognitively [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5042.88s)]
*  impaired. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5047.360000000001s)]
*  There's like a month before the debate he was saying that. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5048.360000000001s)]
*  So of course, Joe Biden watched that show every day. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5050.54s)]
*  That's what gave Joe Scarborough his sense of importance was like, oh, I'm close to the [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5053.42s)]
*  White House. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5056.78s)]
*  He was at the White House all the time. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5057.78s)]
*  Now, Biden is gone. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5058.78s)]
*  Biden is not an asset anymore. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5060.14s)]
*  Trump is back in power. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5061.54s)]
*  And one of the things that has happened amazingly since the since Kamala's loss is that the [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5063.66s)]
*  MSNBC audience, which is already tiny, has basically completely disappeared. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5068.5s)]
*  Like the number of people watching those shows when they're live in prime time with that [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5073.22s)]
*  corporate power behind them promoting it. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5077.9400000000005s)]
*  It's less than a lot of like YouTube shows. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5081.18s)]
*  Oh, wait, wait. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5083.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5084.26s)]
*  Including like, I don't mean like the cumulative audience of how many people watch YouTube [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5085.26s)]
*  or YouTube video at the end of the day. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5088.62s)]
*  I just mean live watching. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5090.1s)]
*  Like Dan Bongino's show has, I think, on Rumble has like five or six or seven times more viewers [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5091.820000000001s)]
*  than MSNBC's prime time. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5099.34s)]
*  This is on Rumble, you know, which a lot of people don't even know about, don't even watch. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5101.7s)]
*  That audience is gone in part because they feel disillusioned that the people they trusted [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5106.7s)]
*  who told them Trump was going to prison, the whole Trump family was going to prison, Trump [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5111.7s)]
*  could never win. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5115.46s)]
*  He was going to be in jail before the election. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5116.54s)]
*  All the women were going to rise up and vote for Kamala out of anger toward Trump. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5118.9s)]
*  None of that happened. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5122.46s)]
*  And they're like, I've been watching this show every day for nothing. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5123.46s)]
*  It was, I was like, none of it happened. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5128.0599999999995s)]
*  None of it was true. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5131.0599999999995s)]
*  And that audience is gone, half out of disillusionment and anger, but half out of just like kind [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5132.38s)]
*  of checking out through impotence and helplessness. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5136.1s)]
*  And I think that they're desperate. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5139.42s)]
*  The only way they think they can get people to come back on is to have Trump come back [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5141.18s)]
*  on their show. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5145.22s)]
*  And Trump is going to make them crawl around on the floor multiple times. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5146.26s)]
*  Work like a dog. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5150.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5151.860000000001s)]
*  They were like, Joe and Mekah were like, Trump was incredibly cheerful and happy. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5152.860000000001s)]
*  Of course he was. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5157.38s)]
*  He loves seeing you humiliate yourself because you know he knows you need them now. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5158.38s)]
*  I don't think that, you know, weekly interview with Trump, which is not going to happen anyway, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5165.1s)]
*  but even if it did, was going to save MSNBC. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5170.22s)]
*  No, because who would watch it? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5172.22s)]
*  Because no conservatives are going to trust that show or MSNBC and no liberals want to [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5173.820000000001s)]
*  see MSNBC host. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5178.22s)]
*  Do you know how angry liberals are about just even the fact that Joe and Mekah went to Mar-a-Lago? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5180.22s)]
*  So who's the audience for that? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5186.38s)]
*  They're caught like Liz Cheney. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5188.740000000001s)]
*  I have to say, of all the reasons I'm so grateful that Kamala lost, seeing Democrats turn on [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5191.86s)]
*  Liz Cheney and seeing her stranded between the parties in No Man's Land. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5198.299999999999s)]
*  It's the best. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5202.54s)]
*  Honestly, I can't, there was a piece by John Nichols in The Nation today, I don't read [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5203.54s)]
*  The Nation much anymore, but you know, occasionally The Nation is like kind of true to itself, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5207.0599999999995s)]
*  not always, but sometimes, and I don't agree with it, but John Nichols wrote this piece [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5212.339999999999s)]
*  about Kamala Harris, where he goes through all the places that she went with, Liz Cheney [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5217.14s)]
*  went with Kamala Harris, and not only did it not work, she turned off Republicans. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5222.1s)]
*  The idea was, you know, we've got Liz Cheney campaigning with us, a lot of Republicans [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5228.18s)]
*  are like, Donald Trump will vote for us. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5231.660000000001s)]
*  It's like just the opposite happened. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5233.26s)]
*  You know, it was so predictable and so obvious at the time. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5235.14s)]
*  It was predictable. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5237.9800000000005s)]
*  Also, what made Kamala's campaign for the six seconds that it seemed like it had some [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5238.9800000000005s)]
*  air to it was this like vibrancy of young people, you know, like celebrating the emergence. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5243.94s)]
*  Right, right, right, yeah, totally. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5249.94s)]
*  And so you then take Liz Cheney and like send Bill Clinton to Michigan to like lecture everybody [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5251.62s)]
*  in the Muslim community, and the Arab community already hates you because you've been buying [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5259.339999999999s)]
*  Israel about how the Israelis are totally right, and it's all the fault of the Arabs. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5262.94s)]
*  And then you take Liz, Dick Cheney's daughter with you through the Rust Belt, where like [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5267.46s)]
*  all those policies devastated their lives, all those wars. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5273.7s)]
*  And you think Liz, think about, I mean, this is the thing, think about how out of touch [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5278.06s)]
*  encloistered and in a bubble you have to be to think that you're going to win an election [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5283.12s)]
*  depending on people who are in the working class who feel alienated from society, who [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5288.38s)]
*  feel like DC doesn't work for you by taking the daughter of like the face of the American [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5291.98s)]
*  establishment, Dick Cheney, around with you as if she's your running mate. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5298.74s)]
*  And people are craving change and you have sitting there with Liz Cheney, like the people [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5303.900000000001s)]
*  only know because she was the vice president's daughter. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5309.42s)]
*  Her dad was Dick Cheney, and not just Dick Cheney, but somebody who supports a whole [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5312.3s)]
*  range of policies that Americans vehemently reject now. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5317.42s)]
*  And I think that's more than anything what people in media have finally had to come to [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5321.06s)]
*  grips with is, first of all, it's good that Liz Cheney actually isn't the Secretary of [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5324.54s)]
*  Defense or Secretary of State. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5328.3s)]
*  That also is good. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5329.3s)]
*  Even though there are a couple of people in Trump's campaign who have very similar views [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5330.54s)]
*  like Mark Ruby and Liz Cheney and Elise Stefanik, but be that as a side, it's good that Liz [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5333.34s)]
*  Cheney specifically is not any of those positions. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5337.820000000001s)]
*  But I think the best thing is that you have all these people inside these cloistered bubbles [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5341.18s)]
*  in Washington who really thought that they were the conscience of the nation, the voice [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5346.74s)]
*  of the nation. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5350.14s)]
*  And not only were they applauding the decision to take Liz Cheney, but they have been spending [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5352.02s)]
*  eight years claiming that Donald Trump is a white supremacist who wants to put minorities [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5356.18s)]
*  in camps. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5360.820000000001s)]
*  And not only did Donald Trump win the election, but there was millions of non-white voters [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5361.820000000001s)]
*  who for the first time left the Democratic Party and went to vote for Trump. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5367.780000000001s)]
*  So imagine you've wasted eight years of your life screaming and screeching like a petulant [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5371.38s)]
*  bird who has been shot. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5376.14s)]
*  Donald Trump's a racist, he's a fascist, he only likes white people. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5377.9800000000005s)]
*  And then you watch millions of Latino people and black people and Asian people and Muslims [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5382.34s)]
*  refuse to vote for Kamala Harris. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5387.58s)]
*  Obviously, I have no influence at all. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5389.46s)]
*  I'm completely out of touch. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5392.14s)]
*  Well, but it's so good to know that about yourself. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5393.54s)]
*  I mean, this happened to me, by the way. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5395.42s)]
*  They're all kind of vehemently opposed to abortion, which I think is horrifying. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5396.74s)]
*  But lots of people don't agree with me. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5402.62s)]
*  And so I see this, Roe v. Wade comes down and you see these ballot initiatives and say, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5403.78s)]
*  we're going to allow abortion until birth. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5407.9400000000005s)]
*  And I'm like, wow, I'm so glad it's up for a vote. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5409.46s)]
*  And then it turns out the voters just don't agree with me at all. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5411.98s)]
*  Even in red states. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5414.78s)]
*  It's true. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5415.78s)]
*  It's true. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5416.78s)]
*  Like that was hard for me to accept because I am, I never talked about it, but I was just [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5417.78s)]
*  so I'm so sincere on the subject. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5421.94s)]
*  I'm not for abortion, period. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5423.94s)]
*  And so but you have to be real like, okay, sometimes people agree with you, sometimes [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5426.339999999999s)]
*  they don't. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5430.419999999999s)]
*  But there's something about the Democratic base, which really is just basically just [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5431.459999999999s)]
*  like unhappy college educated white ladies. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5436.259999999999s)]
*  That's really who it is. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5438.94s)]
*  Honestly, I mean, and they say that they're like, we're relying on affluent women in [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5440.339999999999s)]
*  the suburbs. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5443.74s)]
*  That's their base. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5444.74s)]
*  But the unhappy ones, I mean, I'm related to some happy ones that are not voting for [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5445.74s)]
*  Kamala Harris, but the ones who are sort of disappointed in their husbands that are in [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5448.9s)]
*  their lives or whatever, I get it. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5452.299999999999s)]
*  I'm not being mean, but it's just true. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5453.86s)]
*  But they should know that they're in the subset of a subset and that not everyone agrees [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5455.9s)]
*  with them. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5462.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that's the beginning of wisdom. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5463.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, it has been for me, like not everyone agrees with me. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5464.0199999999995s)]
*  That's okay. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5465.0199999999995s)]
*  But the thing is, like you were just saying you read the nation sometimes. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5466.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5468.299999999999s)]
*  I go out of my way to read everything, everybody. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5469.46s)]
*  Me too. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5472.22s)]
*  You know, I try and have people in my lives who have very different views on, you know, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5473.22s)]
*  I have a lot of people in my life in Brazil, for example, who worship Lua. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5477.46s)]
*  I have a lot of people in my life who hate Lua, worship Bolsonaro, people who are in [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5480.34s)]
*  between. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5483.3s)]
*  I want that. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5484.3s)]
*  Like I want to hear constantly from you. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5485.3s)]
*  Of course. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5486.3s)]
*  You want to be challenged all the time, not be ossified. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5487.3s)]
*  I'm telling you, I know a lot of these people. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5489.3s)]
*  I used to be on MSNBC all the time. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5490.82s)]
*  I've been friends with a lot of the people. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5492.54s)]
*  Who do they hate you now though? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5493.54s)]
*  Oh, they despise me with burning passion. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5495.02s)]
*  In part because nobody hates things more than no one, the person always most hated is the [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5499.26s)]
*  one perceived as the heretic. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5503.82s)]
*  Of course. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5505.18s)]
*  You know, but I was never really on their side in the way that they thought actually [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5506.18s)]
*  anyway. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5510.0599999999995s)]
*  But anyway, it doesn't matter. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5511.0599999999995s)]
*  I know a lot of these people and what has happened on MSNBC is that, or places like [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5512.98s)]
*  the New York Times, Op-Ed page, similar. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5519.46s)]
*  People who support Trump don't exist in that world. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5523.16s)]
*  There's not one Op-Ed writer at the New York Times of the dozens who is a Trump supporter, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5525.06s)]
*  even though half the country is more than half the country is. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5531.18s)]
*  Like Ross 2000 is like the person closest to like sort of understanding the Trump movement, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5533.46s)]
*  but he certainly doesn't like Donald Trump at all. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5537.820000000001s)]
*  And other than that, they just don't have, it doesn't exist in the world. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5539.660000000001s)]
*  There's nobody ever on MSNBC on their shows who brings that perspective of why they support [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5542.4800000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5547.900000000001s)]
*  So if you're only talking to people who are like-minded and a lot of them have now left [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5549.02s)]
*  Twitter trying to go to some other platform where only they're only there. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5553.06s)]
*  They don't want it. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5556.620000000001s)]
*  They really don't want to hear any dissent. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5557.620000000001s)]
*  And you're living a certain kind of life. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5559.5s)]
*  You know, they're well paid. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5561.46s)]
*  They like are cloistered in these like affluent places in the United States, like in the East [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5562.46s)]
*  Coast, like Brooklyn and Manhattan and Washington and Northern Virginia. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5567.18s)]
*  How do you not realize that the life you're leading is so fundamentally different from [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5572.46s)]
*  the people on whose behalf you claim to be speaking? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5576.740000000001s)]
*  I do think a lot of them, even though they're going to resist it and battle it, have to [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5580.12s)]
*  swallow this election as a complete repudiation of not just themselves, but their entire purpose [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5584.32s)]
*  in life, their entire function. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5589.72s)]
*  Do you think that they, again, I just want to say how non-judgmental I feel about this. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5590.72s)]
*  That has happened to me. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5596.4800000000005s)]
*  I've been fired. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5597.84s)]
*  I have found my views repudiated by the public at large. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5598.84s)]
*  Those are very important moments to me personally. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5603.6s)]
*  They made me a better person. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5606.12s)]
*  So I am hoping that they internalize the pain and learn from it. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5607.7s)]
*  Do you think they will? [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5611.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5612.62s)]
*  I mean, what always amazes me is like, you know, I really did grow up like in a working [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5613.62s)]
*  class environment, but like my whole life that was the only one. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5616.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5619.94s)]
*  No, I mean, there are other people who grew up like, you know, I wasn't like poor, but [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5620.94s)]
*  I was not even near middle class. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5623.7s)]
*  Didn't your mom work at McDonald's? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5625.3s)]
*  Yeah, my mom worked at McDonald's. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5626.3s)]
*  She like, my parents got divorced when I was seven. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5627.3s)]
*  My father was an accountant. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5629.46s)]
*  He had three marriages. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5630.46s)]
*  Actually, you are alone. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5631.46s)]
*  Like, I don't know anybody. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5632.46s)]
*  And I mean this. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5634.5s)]
*  I don't know anybody in journalism. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5635.5s)]
*  I know people whose mom worked at McDonald's. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5637.74s)]
*  I don't know anyone in journalism whose mom worked at McDonald's. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5639.1s)]
*  Well, I guess my point is that like, of course that shaped me for a long time, but I realize [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5641.46s)]
*  now that that's not my life any longer. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5647.02s)]
*  Like it hasn't been for, you know, 10 years, 15 years. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5649.06s)]
*  Like my life has been very separate from that. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5652.04s)]
*  So I have a great amount of humility about my ability to speak for people who have a [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5654.02s)]
*  different kind of life because you're of course the way you live shapes your perspective, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5657.5s)]
*  shapes your understanding, shapes your priorities. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5663.34s)]
*  And it amazes me that these people don't have that humility at all. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5664.34s)]
*  And so I think they're resisting it. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5669.58s)]
*  Like they're, you know, that was what Obama did. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5673.0199999999995s)]
*  Remember when he was like, yeah, I know there's a lot of black men who don't want to vote [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5675.14s)]
*  for a comma who are going to vote for Trump. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5677.9s)]
*  That's because you all hate women and you're misogynist. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5679.38s)]
*  And then they're basically saying the reason a lot of Latino men- [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5682.12s)]
*  What an arrogant douchebag to say something like that. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5684.66s)]
*  And there's a perfect example. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5688.14s)]
*  Like he spends all his time in like Richard Branson's yacht. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5689.34s)]
*  And, you know, just with the highest level of jet set. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5692.38s)]
*  And then he thinks he's going to go and speak to like black working class men. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5695.9s)]
*  If you disagree with me, you're a bigot. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5699.54s)]
*  That's like, that's such a crazy place to start any conversation. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5701.38s)]
*  It's so alienating. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5704.42s)]
*  I think, I think this kind of condescension that, but the other thing is like the main [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5705.5s)]
*  argument is that like they're all stupid. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5709.26s)]
*  Like they're victims of disinformation. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5711.92s)]
*  They're misled. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5713.7s)]
*  They have all these alternative media they're listening to that don't have the controls [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5714.96s)]
*  that have with us. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5718.38s)]
*  They're getting fall. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5720.22s)]
*  So basically they're stupid. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5721.22s)]
*  They're like they're easily misled. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5722.22s)]
*  They're gullible. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5724.3s)]
*  So either they're racist or misogynist or stupid. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5725.66s)]
*  That's their explanation. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5728.22s)]
*  That's the thing they're clinging to. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5729.22s)]
*  You know, like, oh, they don't realize how good they had it under Biden, how great the [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5731.14s)]
*  economy is, how much Kamala Harris and Joe Biden did for them. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5735.14s)]
*  They just don't because they were told that it was untrue. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5738.34s)]
*  They can't figure it out for their on their own. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5740.66s)]
*  Like the condescension reeked out of, like just it oozes out of every pore of their being. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5742.62s)]
*  And then they wonder why people despise them and their culture and their subculture. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5748.38s)]
*  Who wants that? [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5752.62s)]
*  It is nauseating. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5753.62s)]
*  But despite what I'm saying is that they're not they don't have the attitude you had, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5755.42s)]
*  which is like, oh, it's actually good to be humbled to like realize that things that you [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5759.86s)]
*  thought about the world need to be reevaluated. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5765.5s)]
*  There's no self-criticism, no reflection. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5769.02s)]
*  In fact, every Democrat thinks like, oh, yeah, I know why we lost. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5771.58s)]
*  It's been what I was saying all along. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5775.02s)]
*  None of them are saying that. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5776.34s)]
*  But you know, they're like Democrats did this and Kamala did that. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5778.099999999999s)]
*  You know, they all are trying to pretend that if people had just listened to them, the Democrats [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5780.42s)]
*  would have won, even though all on they were like, oh, Kamala is running the most brilliant [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5784.98s)]
*  campaign ever. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5788.0199999999995s)]
*  But what I'm saying is, is that the result is so overwhelming, so kind of pointed and [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5789.5s)]
*  devastating to their worldview. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5795.86s)]
*  As I said, I think the thing that has really shaken them the most, even though they're [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5797.42s)]
*  fighting it, they're not embracing it, they're fighting it, but they can, is that so many [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5801.58s)]
*  non-white voters are and Trump made huge gains in almost every non-white sector of [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5806.64s)]
*  society. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5814.04s)]
*  I mean, Trump was saying that New Jersey and New York are swing states and people were [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5815.04s)]
*  laughing at him and he only lost New Jersey by five points and did the best any Republican [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5818.04s)]
*  has done in New York City in many, many years because of how many black and Latino and Asians [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5824.76s)]
*  and Muslims voted for Trump, non-white voters. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5831.92s)]
*  And so when that happens, like you don't even get to blame white people, but you have [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5835.52s)]
*  to accept that the people who you think you own, who have mindless loyalty to you, disobeyed [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5842.320000000001s)]
*  you and didn't listen to you. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5848.4400000000005s)]
*  That's what makes them feel really shaken inside. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5850.88s)]
*  It's a slave revolt. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5852.8s)]
*  And if you read the accounts of people who live through slave revolts, not just in the [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5854.040000000001s)]
*  American South, but like in Haiti or anywhere, they're always, wherever you have slavery, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5857.360000000001s)]
*  you've got slave revolts at some point, they're always so shocked. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5861.52s)]
*  Like they can't believe that like the nanny came after them with a knife. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5865.76s)]
*  Like we thought you loved us. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5872.0s)]
*  It's so crucial to their worldview to believe. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5874.64s)]
*  Those people central to their worldview is that they're benevolent leaders of these people. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5879.120000000001s)]
*  It's like that scene at Animal House. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5885.92s)]
*  Otis, he loves us. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5887.52s)]
*  Sure he does, drunk frat boy. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5889.52s)]
*  No, people always imagine that the people they control, their employees, their serfs, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5893.120000000001s)]
*  love them. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5899.040000000001s)]
*  And what they need to understand, I think this is just true in life, is that the people [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5900.040000000001s)]
*  subordinate to you resent you. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5903.200000000001s)]
*  They may like you, but they also resent you. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5904.76s)]
*  Just the subordinates alone breed resentment. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5906.4800000000005s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5908.96s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons you see hostility among women toward men, just in general. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5910.6s)]
*  It's not a defining characteristic, but there's a little bit of that. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5915.040000000001s)]
*  If you're in the subordinate sexual position, you're like a little mad about it. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5919.24s)]
*  I'm sorry to channel Dr. Freud, but there's some truth in that. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5923.16s)]
*  And it's what we were talking about before about you. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5927.44s)]
*  I've said this so many times. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5929.96s)]
*  If you belong to one of these so-called marginalized groups that liberals think they own and have [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5933.639999999999s)]
*  an entitlement to control, you will never see more naked and unadorned bigotry, contemptuous [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5938.32s)]
*  bigotry that you will see toward individuals within that group who disobey. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5947.24s)]
*  Obviously, I remember when I really started splitting from the left, I'd never had real [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5951.5199999999995s)]
*  homophobia in my entire life before. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5955.599999999999s)]
*  I only started seeing it once I had that breach with the left. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5957.88s)]
*  Once you questioned, before you were a member of the LBGT community, you questioned a marginalized [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5961.76s)]
*  figure. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5966.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5967.92s)]
*  And a pedophile, whatever, all those things. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5968.92s)]
*  And then- [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5971.32s)]
*  Are you serious? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5972.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5973.32s)]
*  You know, the way they have always talked about- [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5974.639999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry to laugh. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5977.04s)]
*  Clarence Thomas. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5978.04s)]
*  No, it's amazing. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5979.04s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5980.04s)]
*  The way they talk about Clarence Thomas. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5981.04s)]
*  Any black person who's been a conservative, same with women who are, Gloria Steinem said [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5983.799999999999s)]
*  about the people, the young women who were refusing to vote for Hillary and voting for [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5990.84s)]
*  Bernie when asked why they were doing that. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5994.719999999999s)]
*  She's like, because young girls go where the boys are. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5996.639999999999s)]
*  You know, the most demeaning, insulting thing you can say about women that they don't think [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=5999.28s)]
*  on their own. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6004.2s)]
*  They just mindlessly do whatever the boys are. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6005.2s)]
*  And so now you're seeing this, oh yeah, Latinos are very misogynistic and primitive. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6008.0s)]
*  So are black men. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6014.36s)]
*  They hate women. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6015.36s)]
*  They're easily misled. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6016.36s)]
*  They're low information voters. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6017.88s)]
*  The amount of contempt that liberal elites have for these non-white voters who didn't [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6020.28s)]
*  do as they're told is almost scary. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6025.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, it is scary because it's a psychological condition. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6028.599999999999s)]
*  That's of course why they hate whites. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6031.08s)]
*  Because they're losing the white vote. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6032.88s)]
*  And the second they start to lose the white vote, then whites became the problem in the [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6034.32s)]
*  country. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6037.04s)]
*  It's like, where's all this anti-white hate coming from? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6038.04s)]
*  Well, it's coming from the Democratic Party institutionally because they're being rejected [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6039.04s)]
*  by white voters. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6042.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6043.400000000001s)]
*  And they were ready to, they thought they were going to get white women that they get [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6044.400000000001s)]
*  to embrace, like white women were going to rise up and join them against Trump. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6046.24s)]
*  But a majority of white women voted for Trump. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6049.64s)]
*  Incredible. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6052.400000000001s)]
*  So they're going to get, I mean, I will say to Hispanics in the United States, you're [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6053.400000000001s)]
*  about to be the subject of a hate campaign. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6057.56s)]
*  Oh, and like the thing, and Muslims too, who didn't want to vote for Kamala because the [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6060.4800000000005s)]
*  person, you know, because they were feeding Israel. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6064.4800000000005s)]
*  I can't tell you how many times I've seen, I can't wait till you people are deported. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6066.4800000000005s)]
*  I can't wait to see you blown up in Gaza. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6070.6s)]
*  There's this sentiment like you're going to get what you deserve and I'm going to laugh [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6073.4400000000005s)]
*  about it and I'm going to cheer it. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6076.160000000001s)]
*  Same with the, with Latinos. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6077.96s)]
*  I can't wait till you're deported. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6079.04s)]
*  You're going to get what you deserve when your abuela is deported. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6081.400000000001s)]
*  Like really sick stuff. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6085.56s)]
*  Joy Reid. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6086.56s)]
*  I'm not talking about obscure people on the internet. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6087.56s)]
*  He's gone on the air almost every night and talked that way. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6089.48s)]
*  Attack the Hispanics. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6092.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, and Muslims and Arabs. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6093.2s)]
*  Well, so the best part about this is the language barrier and very, so few liberals like even [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6095.32s)]
*  bother to listen to what people actually think or say. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6099.719999999999s)]
*  They just, they're not interested. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6102.879999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like they treat everyone like a three year old, but when they find out the [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6104.5199999999995s)]
*  social views of your average Central American, which I find hilarious and kind of great, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6109.12s)]
*  but whatever, leaving my views aside, the average social views of a Central American [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6114.16s)]
*  just on the social issues are so far, far out of what's considered acceptable. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6119.28s)]
*  But they have no idea. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6125.639999999999s)]
*  Which is so ironic because democratic strategists used to openly boast about what if you say [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6126.639999999999s)]
*  you'll get called as a white supremacist with the replacement theory that, oh, we're going [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6131.24s)]
*  to import all these people into United States, make them citizens, and they're going to be [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6134.48s)]
*  supporters of the democratic party and we're going to reign forever like a thousand years [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6137.759999999999s)]
*  because these are all our voters. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6141.32s)]
*  And they get here and they find out that actually they, but, but I have to say like there's [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6142.599999999999s)]
*  a great article in New York magazine, which is words that pass my lips very, very rarely, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6147.56s)]
*  where this writer who actually wrote a very critical profile of me like five years ago. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6152.400000000001s)]
*  So who is it? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6157.160000000001s)]
*  His name is Simon. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6158.64s)]
*  I just talked to him today about this article because it's a great article. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6161.4800000000005s)]
*  I would, I'm embarrassed. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6164.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know his name, but that can't remember his last name. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6165.320000000001s)]
*  It's hyphenated. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6168.200000000001s)]
*  So it's just a little complicated. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6169.200000000001s)]
*  But anyway, I really recommend this article. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6170.200000000001s)]
*  What he did was he purposely went to black Latino Asian neighborhoods where there was [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6172.0s)]
*  a lot of Trump votes and he just walked around on the street and talked to as many people [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6178.16s)]
*  as he could who voted for Trump about why. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6181.44s)]
*  And what I think people don't understand is that the Latino and black NGO presidents who [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6185.12s)]
*  get put on TV or supposedly they're just put, have less in common with the people on whose [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6193.759999999999s)]
*  behalf they're speaking than like the white host of these shows. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6199.48s)]
*  Oh, way less. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6203.2s)]
*  And so you go there. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6204.2s)]
*  Certainly less than me. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6205.2s)]
*  I mean, I have like attitudes that are pretty popular in those communities. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6206.2s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6208.36s)]
*  But still like, you know, a lot of them are just like, far from being like, you know, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6209.36s)]
*  deceived by disinformation. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6215.5599999999995s)]
*  They're like, there's a democratic party that supported NAFTA. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6216.5599999999995s)]
*  Like we're having trouble paying for our healthcare or food for our kids and they're sending billions [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6221.639999999999s)]
*  of dollars to Ukraine and to Israel, to all these other countries. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6225.32s)]
*  They're just talking about the struggles that they have in their lives and the way in which [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6228.68s)]
*  the government doesn't care. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6231.320000000001s)]
*  There's some social issue stuff too. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6232.88s)]
*  But once you get to the United States, you become a citizen, you integrate pretty quickly. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6235.040000000001s)]
*  And the thing you, you don't sit around thinking about trans people or whatever, gay marriage [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6239.360000000001s)]
*  or these are ancillary issues, even if they don't agree with the democratic party on they [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6244.160000000001s)]
*  might, that might contribute to the LA nation. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6247.280000000001s)]
*  The fact that, you know, they had, that's why that Kamala ad was effective, not because [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6249.400000000001s)]
*  people are sitting around thinking about whether trans people should get government funded [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6253.76s)]
*  or not, or they're not going to get tax reassignment surgeries in prison, but because it was like [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6257.68s)]
*  a proxy for explaining that these people have nothing in common with your lives. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6259.92s)]
*  They don't care about you. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6265.320000000001s)]
*  They don't care about your values. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6266.320000000001s)]
*  Had they felt economically satisfied, I don't think that would have resonated because that's [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6267.72s)]
*  not what people care about. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6270.92s)]
*  But most of them are just worried about the same thing everybody else is worried about. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6272.400000000001s)]
*  And they finally got to the point where they realize we've been- [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6276.68s)]
*  But they have less power, so they're even more worried. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6278.240000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6280.320000000001s)]
*  They're the people who get most affected, especially by immigration. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6281.320000000001s)]
*  Totally. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6284.400000000001s)]
*  The people who lose their jobs with immigration often are non-white people, black working [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6285.4s)]
*  class, Latino working class, and they feel resentful about everything that's being done [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6290.719999999999s)]
*  for, you know, there was a lot of, oh, they're giving free housing and free meals to illegal [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6294.36s)]
*  immigrants while I can't feed my family. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6300.36s)]
*  I really recommend the article. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6302.719999999999s)]
*  It's not done with caricature. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6304.5199999999995s)]
*  It's not like handpicking a few comments. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6306.0599999999995s)]
*  It's a very long article, and it just lets these people speak for themselves in a very [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6307.4s)]
*  revealing way. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6311.36s)]
*  What's just so funny is you live in Brazil, which is another continent. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6312.6s)]
*  It is. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6316.76s)]
*  You've been there a while. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6317.76s)]
*  20 years. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6318.76s)]
*  20 years. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6319.76s)]
*  20 years. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6320.76s)]
*  But I bet if I had called you the week before the election, which I should have done, but [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6321.76s)]
*  I got busy, but if I'd said, like, what do you think black and Latino people, men, married [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6323.96s)]
*  people in New York City, around the country, what do you think they think politically? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6331.8s)]
*  I bet you would have been pretty- I know you would have figured this out. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6335.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was talking about this- [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6338.360000000001s)]
*  But you don't even live here. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6339.360000000001s)]
*  I know, but I lived here for the first 38 years of my life. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6341.12s)]
*  It's the only country of which I've ever been a citizen. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6343.32s)]
*  I'm here all the time. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6345.5199999999995s)]
*  But I do think that- [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6347.48s)]
*  But how do you know that? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6349.28s)]
*  And they don't. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6350.28s)]
*  That's the point. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6351.28s)]
*  I think that distance gives you a perspective. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6352.28s)]
*  The fact that my friends are not media and political people in New York and Washington, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6355.179999999999s)]
*  that I'm not hooked into their worldview, that I'm not subsumed with that, that I'm [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6359.92s)]
*  not dependent upon it in any way, gives me, I think, a broader perspective. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6364.32s)]
*  If you live in Northern Virginia and you spend all your time in Washington in green rooms [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6369.64s)]
*  or New York, you're going to be so distorted in the things that you think about the world. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6372.98s)]
*  But also, I think you have to go out of your way to, okay, I don't want to be told what [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6378.02s)]
*  people think by other people who are reporting to their spokespeople. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6382.98s)]
*  I want to hear from them directly. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6385.78s)]
*  I want to look at the polling data. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6387.14s)]
*  I want to understand what they're thinking. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6388.66s)]
*  And you can just see it. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6391.14s)]
*  You could hear it. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6392.14s)]
*  You could feel it. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6393.14s)]
*  You could observe it analytically in data. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6394.14s)]
*  I remember people on CNN saying, I think it was Van Jones or no, it was Bakari Sellers [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6397.620000000001s)]
*  who was like, I don't care what the polls say. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6404.26s)]
*  I can guarantee you there won't be more than 5% of black men voting for Donald Trump. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6407.18s)]
*  I don't care what the polls say. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6410.9400000000005s)]
*  There won't be anywhere near 15% of... [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6412.4400000000005s)]
*  He Bakari Sellers said that? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6416.3s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6417.780000000001s)]
*  Just like, I don't care what the polls say. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6418.780000000001s)]
*  I'm not a huge expert on black America and I don't have a million black friends, but [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6421.38s)]
*  I have some, like actual friends. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6425.78s)]
*  I don't know a liberal black guy. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6428.46s)]
*  I know some who vote for Democrats or whatever, but I don't know. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6431.259999999999s)]
*  I literally don't know, except like the guys you see in green rooms who went to Princeton [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6433.86s)]
*  or like fake preachers or something. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6436.7s)]
*  But like actual black men, I don't know any. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6438.139999999999s)]
*  The only ones are in the media. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6441.219999999999s)]
*  The ones that can pronounce... [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6442.219999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying, I just don't know any person. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6443.219999999999s)]
*  I've never even met one. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6444.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6445.219999999999s)]
*  So like, what is this? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6446.219999999999s)]
*  But this has been, if you think about the Democratic Party, the thing you fear most [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6447.219999999999s)]
*  is that these groups that have been voting for you for generations and have been passed, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6452.22s)]
*  had loyalties passed down from their parents, their grandparents who don't even think about [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6458.120000000001s)]
*  not voting for you every election. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6462.9400000000005s)]
*  Once that breaks, I'm not saying that those people who voted for Trump will never vote [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6465.860000000001s)]
*  Democrat again, but now they know there's an option. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6470.14s)]
*  They're free people. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6473.54s)]
*  They get to decide for themselves who they want and nothing is more alarming or, or, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6474.54s)]
*  or, or much more heart-wrenching. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6480.360000000001s)]
*  I think it's really good. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6484.06s)]
*  It's good for the country. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6485.06s)]
*  The Democratic Party in its currently draft is almost purely destructive, and it was not [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6487.200000000001s)]
*  the spirit of fruit space, but earlier that year that that interesting kind of composition [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6495.240000000001s)]
*  Republicans like JD Vance, Josh Hartley, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6502.6s)]
*  like the ones who really understand [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6505.76s)]
*  that you can't have the same Republican party [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6507.72s)]
*  as you did in 1980, have always been describing [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6509.320000000001s)]
*  the future of the Republican party [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6512.34s)]
*  as a multiracial working class coalition. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6513.46s)]
*  And to watch people identifying primarily based [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6516.08s)]
*  on their citizenship and their class. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6519.8s)]
*  That's what you want. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6522.68s)]
*  As opposed to constantly being divided by race. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6523.5s)]
*  That's what you want. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6525.64s)]
*  Is so- Amen. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6526.4800000000005s)]
*  Promising to see. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6527.84s)]
*  Well, it's essential or else you have Rwanda. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6529.200000000001s)]
*  Because your class can change, [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6532.08s)]
*  but your race doesn't change. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6536.44s)]
*  And so if you engender a conflict [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6538.12s)]
*  on the basis of immutable characteristics, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6539.639999999999s)]
*  it's not solvable. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6541.36s)]
*  And so you don't wanna ever do that. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6542.84s)]
*  Make people hate each other based on how much they make, [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6544.84s)]
*  okay, where they live even, but their skin color? [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6547.24s)]
*  Well, as you say, that gives them the idea of change. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6550.08s)]
*  Like, hey, we can change the government. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6552.4s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6553.599999999999s)]
*  Exactly, whereas immutable characteristic, [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6554.599999999999s)]
*  by definition, don't change. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6556.0s)]
*  No, no, no, that's like Albanian blood feud [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6557.2s)]
*  that lasts 800 years. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6560.32s)]
*  Like you can't do that. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6561.4s)]
*  But that has been the predominant liberal mindset [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6562.48s)]
*  is to encourage people to see themselves [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6565.679999999999s)]
*  as part of insulated factions who hate other factions [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6568.16s)]
*  based on those characteristics. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6571.28s)]
*  And there's almost nothing more offensive to me [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6572.5599999999995s)]
*  about what American liberalism writ large has done [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6574.96s)]
*  than try and impose that framework on people, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6577.96s)]
*  to divide people based on things [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6580.04s)]
*  that in fact don't divide them. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6582.16s)]
*  Well, yeah, especially since the experience [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6583.88s)]
*  of just like living in this country, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6585.84s)]
*  is so different from what they describe. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6588.92s)]
*  I have always been on the right. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6590.84s)]
*  I've never had anybody, anybody who's black or Hispanic [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6592.48s)]
*  or non-white ever attack me one time in public as a racist. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6597.0s)]
*  I've only had affluent white women attack me that way. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6601.04s)]
*  I don't see people hating each other on the basis of race. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6603.92s)]
*  I'm sure there's racism, I know that there is, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6606.8s)]
*  because people are flawed, but it's not a defining fact [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6609.2s)]
*  in this country that I have ever known. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6611.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know what the hell they're talking about. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6613.2s)]
*  I mean, they're trying to scare the shit out of people [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6614.84s)]
*  to get their votes, that's it. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6616.32s)]
*  Well, and obviously, millions of non-white people [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6617.32s)]
*  agree with you since they just went [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6619.759999999999s)]
*  and voted for the white candidate over the black one. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6621.16s)]
*  I know. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6623.599999999999s)]
*  And the white candidate who they were told [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6624.44s)]
*  was Adolf Hitler and wanted to put all non-white people [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6626.48s)]
*  in camps, they were looking around, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6629.28s)]
*  they're like, that's not my experience. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6630.719999999999s)]
*  So I got to, just one last question. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6633.5199999999995s)]
*  Like we began the conversation with the war [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6636.2s)]
*  that we're now in, we're in a war with Russia. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6641.08s)]
*  And that really is something that the Biden administration [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6644.08s)]
*  is doing to punish the incoming Trump administration, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6647.68s)]
*  I think, and to prevent it from acting with the autonomy [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6650.76s)]
*  any administration should have. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6654.32s)]
*  But they're also gonna leave behind all kinds of, [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6656.16s)]
*  I mean, they're not gonna spend the next seven weeks [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6658.8s)]
*  doing nothing. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6660.0s)]
*  More of the things they're gonna try to do [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6661.32s)]
*  is increase censorship, I think, over the next seven weeks, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6662.48s)]
*  or am I just being paranoid? [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6666.32s)]
*  I think you're right, they're obviously [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6667.64s)]
*  not gonna do nothing, they're gonna try and fortify [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6669.88s)]
*  everything as much as possible from the kind of change [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6672.2s)]
*  the American people just voted for, [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6674.56s)]
*  the party of democracy is gonna do that. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6675.8s)]
*  Censorship, in my view, began, like systemic censorship [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6681.52s)]
*  on the internet began as a reaction to 2016. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6685.6s)]
*  Without question. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6688.280000000001s)]
*  Both to Brexit, but especially to Trump. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6689.12s)]
*  That's right. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6690.68s)]
*  That's when you saw the emergence [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6691.52s)]
*  of these highly well-funded disinformation experts, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6693.0s)]
*  the concoction of this fake expertise [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6695.96s)]
*  called disinformation experts. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6697.88s)]
*  How do people get to be that? [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6701.12s)]
*  Where do you go to school to be a disinformation expert? [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6702.400000000001s)]
*  Like a floating arbiter of truth. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6706.400000000001s)]
*  But they needed to radically intensify censorship [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6707.56s)]
*  because they blamed free speech [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6710.92s)]
*  and the free flow of information on, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6713.280000000001s)]
*  they blamed that for Brexit first, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6715.92s)]
*  but especially for Trump's victory. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6718.0s)]
*  And they wanted to crack down on that. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6720.04s)]
*  There's always now an ongoing effort [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6721.200000000001s)]
*  to try and crack down on that. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6723.0s)]
*  I think though, what they're gonna try and do [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6725.4400000000005s)]
*  is look at the areas that they believe Trump [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6727.400000000001s)]
*  is trying most radically to change, [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6730.200000000001s)]
*  beginning with foreign policy. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6732.0s)]
*  That's foreign policy, the thing that they value most. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6732.84s)]
*  That's the centerpiece of how America runs in their view. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6735.72s)]
*  And they're gonna spend as much of their time [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6739.6s)]
*  subverting him and sabotaging him in advance, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6741.76s)]
*  even though he just won the election [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6744.96s)]
*  by a pretty solid margin. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6746.92s)]
*  And there are some things that'll be reversible, [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6751.0s)]
*  but if you escalate the war in Ukraine [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6754.84s)]
*  and Trump now is coming into a war [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6756.88s)]
*  that the Russians perceive accurately [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6758.88s)]
*  to be not just a proxy war with the West behind Ukraine, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6761.64s)]
*  but where NATO is actually bombing Russia, [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6764.72s)]
*  it becomes infinitely more difficult [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6767.360000000001s)]
*  to keep under control and to resolve. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6769.200000000001s)]
*  The problem is that the risks of this are so great [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6772.8s)]
*  that it actually sickens me [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6777.8s)]
*  more than almost anything I've ever seen [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6780.360000000001s)]
*  that they're willing to do this on the way out [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6782.6s)]
*  to just prevent this war from ending [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6785.200000000001s)]
*  and trifling with the risk of a nuclear exchange. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6787.08s)]
*  And with the lives of every person on earth? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6792.4s)]
*  Yeah, I just gotta close by saying, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6796.92s)]
*  there's been an journalist my whole life. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6800.92s)]
*  I spent a lot of time around journalists [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6802.48s)]
*  bragging about the risks they take. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6804.32s)]
*  I've never known a journalist [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6805.5599999999995s)]
*  who's been threatened with prison more times than you have. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6807.08s)]
*  Probably once every six months, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6810.92s)]
*  I just check to make sure that you're not in prison. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6812.2s)]
*  Not in jail, yeah, my friends do that too. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6814.24s)]
*  I'm always assuming you're gonna wind up in prison [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6815.44s)]
*  for challenging the powerful [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6818.639999999999s)]
*  and revealing what they're actually doing. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6821.0s)]
*  So I just wanna say congratulations on remaining free. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6822.28s)]
*  Thank you, I appreciate that. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6824.96s)]
*  It's not always been such an easy task. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6825.96s)]
*  There have been times when I've gotten pretty close, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6828.48s)]
*  including recently, but I feel like if you're not hated by [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6830.32s)]
*  and perceived as a threat by people in power, [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6835.639999999999s)]
*  you're not doing your job. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6838.36s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6839.4s)]
*  That's what I really believe. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6840.24s)]
*  Well, then by that measure, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6841.48s)]
*  you're the most successful journalist of our generation, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6842.48s)]
*  which I already thought of anyway, but congratulations. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6844.24s)]
*  Appreciate that, thank you, Dougher. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6845.8s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6846.84s)]
*  Always great to see you. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6847.679999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6848.5199999999995s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6849.34s)]
*  I know. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6857.16s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6858.0s)]
*  with everything at stake, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6860.5599999999995s)]
*  Google would be putting its thumb on the scale [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6861.8s)]
*  and preventing you from hearing anything [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6864.5599999999995s)]
*  that the people in charge don't want you to hear, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6867.76s)]
*  but it turns out it's happening. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6869.44s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6871.0s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6871.88s)]
*  that's a waste of time, not in charge of Google, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6873.6s)]
*  or we could find a way around it, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6876.160000000001s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that's true. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6877.92s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6881.92s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6883.9400000000005s)]
*  is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6885.96s)]
*  Subscribe and you'll have a much higher chance [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6887.92s)]
*  of hearing what we say, and we hope you will. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKh4txSD0eQ&t=6891.8s)]
