# Man Charged With Treason for Speaking to Tucker About the Killing of Whites in South Africa
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4)
*  So I think for most Americans, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=0.0s)]
*  news about South Africa ended in 1994, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3.72s)]
*  both literally we stopped getting a lot of news [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6.96s)]
*  from the country, but also people's views about it [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=8.74s)]
*  stopped evolving then, that was the year [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=12.92s)]
*  that the apartheid ended, I guess, officially. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  You had elections. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=18.76s)]
*  Nelson Mandela, still a hero in the United States, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=20.62s)]
*  often referred to by politicians. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=22.96s)]
*  And it's only been, I think, in American media in the past, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=24.52s)]
*  couple of months that stories have come out [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=30.24s)]
*  of South Africa that a lot of Americans have read [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=33.2s)]
*  that actually the country seems to be falling apart [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=35.6s)]
*  and that the government is kind of genocidally racist. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=39.04s)]
*  And then President Trump in the past month [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=44.76s)]
*  has basically said the same thing. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=47.04s)]
*  And it's shocking to a lot of people, I think, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  how bad it is and just how racist it is, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=53.32s)]
*  far more than apartheid ever was. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  And so I'm wondering, since you've just landed [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=58.78s)]
*  from South Africa, you live there, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=80.8s)]
*  describe the state of the country right now, if you would. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=82.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, perhaps I can start with your reference [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=85.4s)]
*  about the 90s, because it's absolutely true. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=89.0s)]
*  South Africa and America was very involved [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  with the setting up of the political system [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  that we have in South Africa during the 90s. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=95.4s)]
*  And it was, of course, the end of history era. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  Everyone is excited about the fall of the Berlin Wall [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=98.76s)]
*  and the whole world's going to be liberal and democratic, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=101.76s)]
*  including African countries. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  And Samuel Huntington actually cautioned against this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  in 1996, saying, when he wrote the Clash of Civilizations, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  and he said, don't expect of African leaders [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=112.04s)]
*  and African liberation movements to suddenly become Western [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=115.14s)]
*  when you give them Western constitutions, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=119.08s)]
*  because they are still African. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=121.56s)]
*  So they will use, it's the democratic paradox. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=123.4s)]
*  They will use democratic institutions [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=125.24s)]
*  to promote non-democratic ends. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=127.44s)]
*  And that's what we see in South Africa. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=130.68s)]
*  We have a parliament, we have a very liberal constitution. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=132.44s)]
*  But if you read the constitution [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=135.72s)]
*  and you compare that to reality in South Africa, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=137.44s)]
*  it's two completely different worlds. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=139.52s)]
*  The de facto and the de-ure reality in South Africa [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=141.4s)]
*  is irreconcilable. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  And the reason why we're seeing in South Africa [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  is firstly, there was this major excitement [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  about the new South African, Alce Mandela, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  the miracle story, Oprah spoke about this, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  and Charlize Theron, everyone. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=155.44s)]
*  But the reality on ground level [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=158.72s)]
*  was in many ways the opposite. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  And I think a lot of- [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  From the beginning? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=162.64s)]
*  Gradually. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=164.56s)]
*  So they started, for example, with these BEE, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  as they call it, it's Black Economic Empowerment, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=168.44s)]
*  which of course has nothing to do with economic empowerment. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=170.56s)]
*  They started with that in 1996. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  And so they actually said, initially in the 90s, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=176.44s)]
*  that that's the ruling party's strategy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=179.68s)]
*  They still call it that, the National Democratic Revolution, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=182.0s)]
*  which is about using democracy to promote socialist ends. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  And so the revolution, they say, goes in two phases. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=189.56s)]
*  The first phase is present yourself [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  as being liberal and democratic and get support, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=194.68s)]
*  especially international support and local, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=197.16s)]
*  and then use multi-party democracy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=199.68s)]
*  as a way of promoting the goals [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=202.08s)]
*  of taking the country down the road to socialism. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=204.76s)]
*  And so recently, they even went as far as publishing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=207.12s)]
*  a document saying, we are now ready [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  for the second phase of the revolution. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=211.2s)]
*  We now have power, we have control of the state. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=212.88s)]
*  We now need to use this to become much more aggressive [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=215.0s)]
*  in our socialist policies. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  And we're seeing this in a plethora of new laws, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  all of a sudden, in South Africa, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  which I think it's gotten to the point [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=224.44s)]
*  where it's just not possible to maintain the view [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=226.76s)]
*  that people have had of South Africa [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=230.32s)]
*  for the last few decades [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  and look at what's currently happening in South Africa. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=233.84s)]
*  It's two completely different worlds. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=235.88s)]
*  And hopefully, or happily at least, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=237.68s)]
*  a lot of people are starting to wake up to this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  So you said Samuel Huntington wrote that in 1996, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  two years after the election. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=247.16s)]
*  I kind of thought that from day one [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=251.52s)]
*  simply because I knew people there [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=254.56s)]
*  and I was more familiar with the details of the Mandelas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=257.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=261.88s)]
*  But I think most Americans don't get any idea, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  like what was Nelson Mandela on Robben Island for? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=265.56s)]
*  What was he in prison for? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=267.56s)]
*  For being black? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=269.92s)]
*  Was there another reason? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, literally, so I have children [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=271.92s)]
*  and they are taught in schools [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  and the government prescribes [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=276.56s)]
*  what children should learn in history. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=277.68s)]
*  And so the official version is he went to prison [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=280.32s)]
*  because he was a good leader [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  and the government didn't like that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  I should say that he certainly was the best [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=286.72s)]
*  that the ANC has ever had to offer. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=288.72s)]
*  But the reason why he went to prison [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  is because they started Mkwantwe Sizwe, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=292.68s)]
*  which was the military wing of the ANC, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=295.68s)]
*  which became involved with military actions in South Africa [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=298.72s)]
*  with an attempt to overthrow the government. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=302.12s)]
*  And they actually, and this is, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=304.68s)]
*  I'm quoting from the ANC's own policy documents [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  that's on their own website. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  So they had this operation when they started, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=310.2s)]
*  which was used in the Rivonia trial against Nelson Mandela. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=312.24s)]
*  It was a strategy called Operation Mayi Bouye [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=316.04s)]
*  and the slogan of this operation was, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=319.8s)]
*  shamelessly we shall attack the weak [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=322.08s)]
*  and shamelessly we shall flee from the strong. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=324.68s)]
*  So those were the circumstances in the 1960s. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=327.56s)]
*  Pretty a noble policy statement there, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=331.08s)]
*  we'll attack the weak and flee from the strong. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=333.44s)]
*  And it's still on their website, you can find it there. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  So that was an attempt at an armed uprising. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=338.12s)]
*  Now we can talk about everything that was wrong [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=341.04s)]
*  with the previous political system in South Africa [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  and there was a lot wrong, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=345.8s)]
*  but it's simply not the case that he went to prison [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=347.12s)]
*  for being a good leader. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think that most people would acknowledge [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=352.32s)]
*  a distinction between military action, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=354.96s)]
*  which is a fight, a war, a battle between militaries [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  and attacks on civilians, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=364.12s)]
*  which is something we call terrorism. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=365.24s)]
*  Yes, so in 1985, the ANC had a conference in Kabwe [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  in Zambia and they took a formal decision [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=373.44000000000005s)]
*  that in their so-called military operations, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  they would not differentiate between hard and soft targets. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=379.6s)]
*  So it was officially a policy that says, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  we can kill innocent people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=384.48s)]
*  And a lot of innocent people died in the political violence [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=386.32000000000005s)]
*  in the run up to 1994 and 90% of the people who died [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=389.36s)]
*  were black South Africans. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=393.36s)]
*  But noncommence, women, children, passersby, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=396.12s)]
*  people had nothing to do with anything. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=399.64000000000004s)]
*  Yes, yes, especially. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  And so during that time that Mandela was in prison, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=403.12s)]
*  I'm 55, so I remember this very, very well, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=406.88000000000005s)]
*  his wife was effectively his spokesman, Winnie Mandela, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=409.12s)]
*  and she was lionized in the United States. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  She was a hero, she was the mother of an emerging nation, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  a woman of peace and decency, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=417.68s)]
*  really a transcendent figure, a holy figure. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  And then it turned out that actually she was a murderer [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=422.68s)]
*  who had burned to death or supervised the murder [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=425.68s)]
*  of a bunch of different people. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=430.16s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  Yes, so let me firstly say that I have a lot of respect [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=432.2s)]
*  for Nelson Mandela, I think in terms of his efforts [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=434.76s)]
*  and as I say, I think he's the best [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=437.76s)]
*  the ANC has ever had to offer. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=440.56s)]
*  Winnie Mandela, his wife, not so much. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=442.64s)]
*  So she famously, I mean, she's been involved [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=444.92s)]
*  with a lot of things, including what was called [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=447.0s)]
*  the Mandela Football Club, which was a gang [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  that was involved with violence [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  and killings of innocent people. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=454.84s)]
*  And she famously said at a political rally [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=457.28s)]
*  with our necklaces and our matches, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=460.56s)]
*  we will liberate this country, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=462.88s)]
*  which of course is a reference to the necklace murders, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=464.68s)]
*  which was very popular in South Africa [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=466.96s)]
*  and still happens in South Africa. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  That's when you take a rubber tire, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=470.56s)]
*  you fill it with petrol or gasoline, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=472.88s)]
*  and you put it around someone's neck [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  so that it's bound around their arms [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  and you set it on fire. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=479.44s)]
*  And then you stone that person while he's burning to death. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=481.0s)]
*  And that happened, there were, I think, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=483.96s)]
*  five or 700 people were killed like that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  during political violence in South Africa. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  And she encouraged this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=489.48s)]
*  Initially she denied it, and then it came out [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=491.04s)]
*  that it was recorded of her saying this. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=492.92s)]
*  So yes, it's very bizarre that someone like Winnie Mandela [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=496.16s)]
*  is a hero today. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=500.04s)]
*  And was a hero then. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=501.72s)]
*  And so that to me was a sign that these are not liberators [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=502.68s)]
*  that they're oppressors. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=510.24s)]
*  And so, but no one in the West wanted to think that. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=511.08000000000004s)]
*  It was like a really simple tale of white oppression, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=513.4s)]
*  of noble black people, and by definition, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=515.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, there were oppressed black people, of course. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=519.64s)]
*  And there were noble black people, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=523.16s)]
*  but the leadership always struck me as evil. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=524.2s)]
*  Yes, so there were some better and some worse people [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=526.96s)]
*  in the leadership. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=529.88s)]
*  I think an important component here [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=531.0s)]
*  that is very well documented, it's not a secret, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=533.52s)]
*  but a lot of people don't seem to want to know this [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=535.92s)]
*  or recognize this, is the very strong alliance [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=538.2s)]
*  that the ANC has always had and still has [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=541.28s)]
*  with the South African Communist Party, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=543.6s)]
*  and the extent to which they were supported, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=545.72s)]
*  not just by the Soviet Union, also by the Vietnamese, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=548.4399999999999s)]
*  and by Mao Tse Tung as well, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=551.52s)]
*  implementing what they call the People's War Strategy [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=554.1999999999999s)]
*  that they got from Mao Tse Tung. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  So yes, it was very much the ANC saw themselves [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=559.52s)]
*  as being the African or South African frontier [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=562.52s)]
*  of promoting a socialist or a communist revolution. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=565.9599999999999s)]
*  So how did it turn out? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=570.72s)]
*  Well, you mean in terms of where we are today? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=574.16s)]
*  Let's just follow different threads. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=576.6s)]
*  So let's just start with, I don't know, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=580.24s)]
*  technology and infrastructure. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=582.0s)]
*  What did, in 1993, South Africa was famously [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=583.52s)]
*  the most prosperous society in Africa by far, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  And among the most prosperous in the world, correct? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=591.76s)]
*  They had nuclear weapons in South Africa. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=594.88s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=596.16s)]
*  What is it like now, 30 years later? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=599.0s)]
*  Well, the reality is that virtually [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=602.36s)]
*  every sphere of society is collapsing, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=606.2s)]
*  with the exception of taxation, of course, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=608.48s)]
*  and tax collection that's still very, very efficient. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=610.84s)]
*  Maybe I can explain it this way. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=613.6s)]
*  So America has a somewhat skewed tax system [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=615.88s)]
*  with, if my information is correct, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=621.24s)]
*  about 85% of tax, income tax in America [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=623.1600000000001s)]
*  is paid by about 10% of the people. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that's correct. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=628.9200000000001s)]
*  So one in 10. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=629.76s)]
*  In South Africa, 85% of income tax [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=631.0400000000001s)]
*  is paid by one in 30 people. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=633.76s)]
*  So it's a very small number of people, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=637.16s)]
*  a very small portion of society that pays tax, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=638.56s)]
*  that is heavily taxed. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=643.36s)]
*  And then about almost half of the population [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  in South Africa get money from the government [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=647.88s)]
*  in the form of social grants. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=650.0s)]
*  If you add government employees, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=651.8399999999999s)]
*  conservative estimates say that 50% of people [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=654.0s)]
*  in South Africa get money from the government. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  Some estimates say it's up to 60% of adults, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  voting age adults, get money from the government each year. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=663.2s)]
*  So then this money, of course, is then used, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=666.32s)]
*  it's given out as social grants, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=670.08s)]
*  but what's left is used to set up these programs [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  that are actively discriminating against taxpayers. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, there are so many examples. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=678.76s)]
*  One of the most recent ones is this Blacks Only Fund [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=679.9200000000001s)]
*  that the government has set up, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=683.1600000000001s)]
*  whereby they give money to black entrepreneurs exclusively. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=684.72s)]
*  So this is happening. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=687.76s)]
*  And then on top of that, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=689.08s)]
*  so after you spend your tax money [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=690.92s)]
*  to fund these government programs [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=693.4799999999999s)]
*  that are discriminating against you, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=695.28s)]
*  you have to spend what is left to do the things [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=697.0799999999999s)]
*  that the government was supposed to be doing. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=699.28s)]
*  So the classical definition of a government [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=701.0799999999999s)]
*  is that it should protect life, liberty, and property. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=702.92s)]
*  The classical liberal view, we're a bit Ciceronian, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=705.68s)]
*  so we think a government has to do more than that. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=708.04s)]
*  But if we use those three things, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=710.4799999999999s)]
*  the government's not protecting our lives. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=712.68s)]
*  There's about, if this interview [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=714.8s)]
*  that we're about to have is two hours, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=718.0s)]
*  there will be about seven murders [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=719.8s)]
*  in South Africa in this time. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=721.2s)]
*  Government does not protect liberty. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=723.4s)]
*  It's actively targeting schools of minority communities, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=724.96s)]
*  actively denying the identity [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=727.72s)]
*  and the rights of minority communities. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=729.68s)]
*  And it's certainly not protecting property. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=732.0s)]
*  It's actively involved with the program [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=733.88s)]
*  to empower the government to expropriate private property [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=736.16s)]
*  without compensation. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=738.84s)]
*  So, and then we have to use the money that is left [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=740.28s)]
*  to pay for our own private security, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=743.8s)]
*  to become involved with organizations, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=745.92s)]
*  to fulfill the things that the government [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=747.72s)]
*  was supposed to be doing with the tax money [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=749.2s)]
*  that we paid in the first place. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=751.5600000000001s)]
*  One of the reasons that I find this story so fascinating [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=754.96s)]
*  is not simply because it's like the classical irony [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=758.6400000000001s)]
*  of history, this group comes in with one name [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=763.6400000000001s)]
*  and then she's exactly the opposite. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=766.24s)]
*  We're gonna end racism and then make racism much worse. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=767.6800000000001s)]
*  But also because they have gone about it [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=771.6400000000001s)]
*  in a way that's almost like American, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=773.48s)]
*  the same language, the same diversity is our strength, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=776.48s)]
*  kind of sloganeering, and it's had the same result, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=779.44s)]
*  which is to basically kill whites. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=782.24s)]
*  And I, I mean, that's just true. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  And I wonder if you see that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=787.36s)]
*  It's almost like you imported our kind of [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=790.2s)]
*  intellectual class framework for this project. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=794.44s)]
*  That's absolutely the case. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=797.6s)]
*  So there's a theory, there was this video [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  that just went viral on social media [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=800.72s)]
*  of this guy talking about how white people are subhuman [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=802.72s)]
*  and all of that. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=806.3199999999999s)]
*  And they get, well, this is taught at universities [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=807.48s)]
*  in South Africa, there's a theory called [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=809.9599999999999s)]
*  Azania Critical Theory. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=811.52s)]
*  Azania is a pan-African word for South Africa. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=812.9599999999999s)]
*  And they actually get this from Americans, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=816.1999999999999s)]
*  like Robin D'Angelo, who's this Ibrahim X. Kendi, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=818.28s)]
*  Tana Isikko, these people, they get it from them. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=822.1999999999999s)]
*  And then they put an African flavor on it, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=824.76s)]
*  which essentially boils down to a theory [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=827.3199999999999s)]
*  that justifies the targeting and extermination [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=830.1999999999999s)]
*  of the white minority. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=833.56s)]
*  And so the theory, to summarize, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=835.24s)]
*  goes more or less like this. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=837.0s)]
*  There's an African term called Ubuntu, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=839.0s)]
*  which means brotherliness, or it's about [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=840.84s)]
*  your internal humanity, it's a Zulu term. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  And the theory goes that white people [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=847.4s)]
*  are incapable of having Ubuntu. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=850.0s)]
*  But Ubuntu is the essence of humanity. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=852.32s)]
*  So if you don't have it, you're not truly human. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=855.28s)]
*  So it boils down, the logical conclusion is that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=857.6s)]
*  if you kill a white person, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=860.72s)]
*  then you did not actually commit murder. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=862.36s)]
*  So this is not widely believed in South Africa, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=865.48s)]
*  but this is taught at universities by university professors. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=868.1600000000001s)]
*  And it's certainly believed by radical elements. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=871.5200000000001s)]
*  It's a predicate for genocide. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=874.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's always the same in every, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=875.88s)]
*  I mean, we're watching in parts of the world now, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=877.48s)]
*  they're not fully human, right? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=879.08s)]
*  So we can kill them, because they're fully human. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  Then it's of course a grave sin to kill them. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, we've always been saying [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  that there's not a genocide in South Africa, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=886.4000000000001s)]
*  looking at what happened in Rwanda and so forth. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=888.1600000000001s)]
*  It's not the same thing. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=890.36s)]
*  But it is very alarming to look at some of these claims [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=892.0799999999999s)]
*  that are being made and to compare that [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=895.16s)]
*  to what was made in Rwanda. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=897.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, every country, and genocide broadly defined, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  an attempt to eliminate a group of people [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=902.64s)]
*  on the basis of their race or ethnicity. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=905.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and we have these political parties chanting. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, you've seen this, you've reported on this, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=910.4s)]
*  chanting, kill the boer, kill the farmer, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=912.16s)]
*  to a stadium filled with people. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=913.92s)]
*  And it's not just rhetoric. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=916.24s)]
*  So they would say, no, it's just a metaphor. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=917.68s)]
*  But it's preceded by a speech about [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=919.92s)]
*  how white people are criminals [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=922.9599999999999s)]
*  and should be treated like criminals, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=924.28s)]
*  how everything they have is illegitimate and stolen, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=925.68s)]
*  in which people are encouraged to go [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=928.4s)]
*  and invade their farms and so forth. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=930.0s)]
*  And then they chant, kill the boer, kill the farmer, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=931.9599999999999s)]
*  and they make these hand gestures. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=934.0s)]
*  Of course, the boer is a reference to the Afrikaner people. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=935.56s)]
*  And, but the reality is also that the farmers [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=938.92s)]
*  are being attacked and killed on their farms. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=941.4399999999999s)]
*  So it's not just a metaphor. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=943.16s)]
*  And our attempts at researching this has found [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=944.92s)]
*  that there's an increase in farm attacks. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=947.92s)]
*  Obviously, when the political climate becomes heated [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=950.28s)]
*  or warmer, and these type of statements are made [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=953.28s)]
*  in a way that's highly publicized, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=956.52s)]
*  you do get an increase in farm attacks. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=958.72s)]
*  And it's very brutal and very horrific farm attacks [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=960.76s)]
*  that we see. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=963.64s)]
*  So the farm attacks are attacks against white farmers, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=964.48s)]
*  not against? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=967.64s)]
*  Not exclusively white farmers, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=968.48s)]
*  but it's attacks against farmers in South Africa, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=969.6s)]
*  of which the majority is white. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=971.4s)]
*  Right, okay. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=973.04s)]
*  So this has been going on a long time. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=974.2s)]
*  I think it's been well-documented. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=976.52s)]
*  I believe you wrote a book about it, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=978.52s)]
*  which has become very, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=980.2399999999999s)]
*  sold a lot of copies on Amazon, I noticed. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=983.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=985.3599999999999s)]
*  And so none of this is like a secret, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=986.88s)]
*  and all of it's verifiable because, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=989.28s)]
*  dead people are pretty easy to track because they're dead. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=991.56s)]
*  Yeah, we have the names of the people who've been murdered. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=993.7199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=995.5999999999999s)]
*  But in the United States, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=997.0799999999999s)]
*  the country that inspired the revolution [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=998.56s)]
*  that you're living through, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1001.4s)]
*  our media have ignored that, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1002.8399999999999s)]
*  and then gone beyond ignoring it [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1005.04s)]
*  to attack anyone who brings it up [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1007.52s)]
*  as a quote, white supremacist. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1009.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, I can tell you so many stories about this. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  Please do. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1015.28s)]
*  For example, I was on your show a few years ago [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1016.12s)]
*  to talk about the farm murders, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1017.8399999999999s)]
*  and the extent to which we were attacked [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1020.0s)]
*  by American media as a result of that. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1022.28s)]
*  I had someone from CNN come see me in my office in Pretoria, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1024.56s)]
*  and to interview me about farm attacks. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1028.76s)]
*  And the entire interview was about you. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1031.48s)]
*  So you would put things to me and say, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1033.88s)]
*  did you know Tucker Carlson said the following? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1035.68s)]
*  Do you agree with this statement? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1038.0s)]
*  And did you know that Donald Trump said this? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1039.44s)]
*  And are you comfortable with this? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1042.0s)]
*  And so I paused him at one stage and I said, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1043.6000000000001s)]
*  what are we doing? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1045.48s)]
*  I thought we had to talk about farm murders [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1046.2800000000002s)]
*  and what's happening in South Africa. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1048.3600000000001s)]
*  But the only, so the argument was that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  because Trump made that comment about farm murders in 2018, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1052.0800000000002s)]
*  it has to be a non-existing issue because Trump is a liar [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1056.96s)]
*  and everything he says is false. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1060.2s)]
*  And the same with you, because you spoke about it, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1061.72s)]
*  that means that the problem doesn't exist. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1064.48s)]
*  And we have to prove that it doesn't exist [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1065.96s)]
*  in order to get to you. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1067.64s)]
*  Well, not only doesn't it exist, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1068.48s)]
*  you're not allowed to complain about it existing. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1070.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1073.24s)]
*  I mean, it's somehow, it's somehow a moral crime to notice [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1074.0800000000002s)]
*  and to not like it when people are murdered [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1080.3600000000001s)]
*  for the color of their skin. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1082.48s)]
*  It's bizarre, it's- [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1084.16s)]
*  Well, it's not bizarre, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1085.68s)]
*  they're telegraphing genocidal intent [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1087.6000000000001s)]
*  when they're telling you, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1089.2s)]
*  no, you're not getting killed, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1091.24s)]
*  and yes, it's a good thing that you are. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1092.4s)]
*  Yes, and now you're not getting killed. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1093.8400000000001s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1095.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's no, you're not getting killed, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1096.64s)]
*  and if you are, you deserve it. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1098.0400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1099.48s)]
*  Because of a variety of things, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1100.44s)]
*  because the attackers are poor, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1101.8000000000002s)]
*  or because remember all the horrible things [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1104.0400000000002s)]
*  that white people have done in South Africa [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1105.76s)]
*  and outside of South Africa. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1108.16s)]
*  So there's always a justification. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1109.76s)]
*  And so another example, just in 2018, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1111.8000000000002s)]
*  again, after you spoke about this [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1115.16s)]
*  and after Trump spoke about this, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1116.6000000000001s)]
*  the president of South Africa, Cyril Romposa, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1119.0s)]
*  came to America, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1120.84s)]
*  and he spoke at an event in New York, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1122.96s)]
*  and he said, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1125.72s)]
*  there are no killings of farmers in South Africa. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1126.6399999999999s)]
*  And he just flat out denied the existence of the problem. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1129.36s)]
*  And he said this on an international platform. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1133.44s)]
*  He said, it's not happening, it's not true. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1135.24s)]
*  And the worst of it all was how the media knew [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1137.44s)]
*  this was wrong, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1141.12s)]
*  especially mainstream media in South Africa. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1142.36s)]
*  They knew that it's not true, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1143.96s)]
*  and so they immediately rushed to his defense, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1145.48s)]
*  writing articles like, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1148.04s)]
*  this is what he actually meant to say, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1149.68s)]
*  and then they sort of justify what's happening. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1151.76s)]
*  And so we really do sometimes feel [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1153.8400000000001s)]
*  that our biggest battle is not primarily [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1157.3600000000001s)]
*  against what the government is doing, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1160.3200000000002s)]
*  but against how the media is reporting. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1161.5600000000002s)]
*  But just consider this. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1162.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, if Tootsies and Kilgali in 1994 said, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1163.92s)]
*  boy, a lot of us seem to be getting hacked to death [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1170.0800000000002s)]
*  by machetes, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1173.2800000000002s)]
*  and reporters or political figures said, shut up. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1174.72s)]
*  You're a Tootsie supremacist for saying so. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1179.24s)]
*  I think we could fairly say that people [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1183.0400000000002s)]
*  shouting them down are pro-genocide of Tootsies. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1184.7600000000002s)]
*  I mean, what's the other explanation? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1188.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't really get it. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1189.96s)]
*  I mean, honestly, what's the other explanation? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1190.92s)]
*  Well, the explanation that is used in court cases, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1193.8000000000002s)]
*  so by the way, the skill the Boer chant [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1197.2800000000002s)]
*  was found in court not to be hate speech, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1199.3200000000002s)]
*  according to South African law. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1201.7600000000002s)]
*  It's not hate speech. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1202.96s)]
*  Killing people is not hate speech. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1203.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, chanting about killing people. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1204.64s)]
*  You know why it's not hate speech? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1206.68s)]
*  Because it's not speech they hate. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1207.76s)]
*  That's why. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1209.08s)]
*  Well, maybe that's it. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1209.92s)]
*  It's speech they approve of. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1210.76s)]
*  So the arguments that is used or are used [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1211.88s)]
*  to defend this type of rhetoric [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1216.1200000000001s)]
*  would always be something like you need to see it in context. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1218.16s)]
*  You need to remember the apartheid system. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1221.44s)]
*  You need to remember what these people went through. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1223.3600000000001s)]
*  That they deserve to be killed. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1225.28s)]
*  You need to remember that. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1226.44s)]
*  So the argument is that they're actually commemorating [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1227.56s)]
*  the historic struggle, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1230.68s)]
*  and that's why they are still chanting this today. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1232.16s)]
*  I would disagree with you. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1233.92s)]
*  I think what they're saying is the people getting murdered [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1234.8s)]
*  deserve to be murdered, so stop complaining about it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1237.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, a few people are saying that out loud, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1239.92s)]
*  but that does seem to be the same thing. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1242.32s)]
*  I mean, look, at some point, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1243.16s)]
*  I don't need you to explain your motive [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1245.32s)]
*  if I have a clear glimpse of your actions. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1249.2s)]
*  If I know what you're doing, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1251.0s)]
*  I don't have to hear you explain why you're doing it. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1252.44s)]
*  I already know, because the motive is displayed [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1254.3600000000001s)]
*  in the action. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1258.4s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1259.52s)]
*  Yep. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1260.3600000000001s)]
*  So in other words, if I pull out a gun and shoot you, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1261.2s)]
*  and somebody said, did you not like Ernst? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1263.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1265.64s)]
*  I would say whatever I want, but I just shot you. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1266.52s)]
*  So I think it's kind of fair to infer that I didn't like you. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1268.2s)]
*  Yeah, but the motive is also explained in the words. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1271.44s)]
*  So they're trying to defend the words. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1275.3600000000001s)]
*  It's the famous story of Chamberlain and Churchill. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1276.96s)]
*  When Chamberlain came back from meeting Hitler, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1279.3600000000001s)]
*  and he said, no, well, I met him, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1281.4s)]
*  and I think we're gonna find peace. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1283.04s)]
*  And then Churchill said, no, well, I read what he said, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1285.64s)]
*  and I believed him. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1287.88s)]
*  And so you can just read what they're saying. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1289.48s)]
*  If you read the policy documents of the ruling party, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1291.6s)]
*  they say they want to convert South Africa [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1293.68s)]
*  into a communist society. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1295.96s)]
*  They want to have a revolution in South Africa. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1297.2s)]
*  And if you listen to the more radical parties [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1299.6000000000001s)]
*  to the left of them, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1301.44s)]
*  they openly chant about killing white people. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1302.28s)]
*  So they say these things out loud. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1305.52s)]
*  And now they are obviously more to the fringe. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1309.52s)]
*  You find the more extreme rhetoric in South Africa, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1311.8s)]
*  but it's very alarming, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1313.92s)]
*  and how people just rush to their defense all the time. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1315.96s)]
*  Perna Washington is terrified and distraught [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1318.96s)]
*  by the Trump revolution now in progress, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1321.56s)]
*  and it is a revolution. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1323.96s)]
*  And it's unfolding along very familiar lines. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1325.44s)]
*  The White House is now giving voters [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1328.4s)]
*  what they actually want, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1330.24s)]
*  and what they've wanted for a long time. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1332.0400000000002s)]
*  And that's the one thing [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1333.4s)]
*  that permanent Washington doesn't want to give them. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1334.24s)]
*  They are working to stop it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1337.76s)]
*  Fortunately, our friends at Heritage, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1339.5600000000002s)]

*  They've spent years thinking this through. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1343.2s)]
*  How do you dismantle permanent DC, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1345.0s)]
*  the deep structures underneath everything? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1347.0400000000002s)]
*  How do you train replacements [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1349.0s)]
*  for the bureaucrats getting canned? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1350.0800000000002s)]
*  How do you enact policies that voters actually voted for? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1351.64s)]

*  They've been successful, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1374.0s)]

*  We hope you will. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1381.92s)]
*  So that's the part that bothers me. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1382.96s)]
*  I'll just say it. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1385.24s)]
*  I'm not surprised at all. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1386.08s)]
*  I watched what happened in Rhodesia [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1387.28s)]
*  when it became Zimbabwe in 1980, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1388.96s)]
*  and something identical happened. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1390.68s)]
*  There was a lot of killing, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1393.56s)]
*  and they drove it to the bottom rank of nations, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1395.6s)]
*  the poorest country in the world. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1399.12s)]
*  And following exactly the same script, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1401.12s)]
*  I always thought that would happen in South Africa. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1403.08s)]
*  I wanted to be wrong. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1405.04s)]
*  Turns out I wasn't. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1406.12s)]
*  What really bothers me is that the West [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1407.84s)]
*  has allowed this and cheered it on, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1411.72s)]
*  because I live in the West. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  I live in the United States. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1415.72s)]
*  So I don't want to think that my leaders [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1416.56s)]
*  are for killing people on the basis of race, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1418.72s)]
*  but watching how they've stood by and applauded, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1420.96s)]
*  Barack Obama's applauded all this stuff, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1425.6799999999998s)]
*  it tells you everything about Barack Obama [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1427.9199999999998s)]
*  and other American leaders, doesn't it? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1429.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes, and this brings us back to the 90s. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1431.3999999999999s)]
*  So during the 90s, it was, again, after the Cold War, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1434.1999999999998s)]
*  and the world, and especially the West, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1436.6399999999999s)]
*  was high on ideology and this idea [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1438.04s)]
*  that the world will become liberal, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1440.72s)]
*  and everyone's gonna become like us, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1442.6s)]
*  and everyone in the world is just an American [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1444.1999999999998s)]
*  waiting to be liberated, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1446.6399999999999s)]
*  and we just need to go and liberate them [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1447.9599999999998s)]
*  from their own traditional beliefs and so forth. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1449.76s)]
*  And so it really is the case that America [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1452.6s)]
*  and many Western countries played a very significant role [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1455.4399999999998s)]
*  in creating the South Africa that we have today. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1458.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware, I'm aware. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1460.56s)]
*  And so we don't want other people [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1462.08s)]
*  to fix our problems on our behalf. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1464.8s)]
*  We want to solve our own problems, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1466.56s)]
*  but you can certainly make the case [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1468.12s)]
*  that the West has a moral responsibility [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1470.8000000000002s)]
*  towards the people in South Africa. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1472.76s)]
*  Of course, the West forced through sanctions and boycotts [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1474.0800000000002s)]
*  the change of government that put the ANC in power. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1478.52s)]
*  So absolutely, in the same way the West has armed Ukraine, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1481.52s)]
*  so they have an obligation to make sure, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1485.24s)]
*  to at least know what's happening and to be honest about it, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1489.24s)]
*  not to hide their own responsibility for the crime. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1491.28s)]
*  Yeah, and so there's this false dichotomy in South Africa [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1494.68s)]
*  or with regard to South Africa [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1498.28s)]
*  that if you are against what's happening in South Africa now, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1499.52s)]
*  that means you want the apartheid system. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1503.08s)]
*  So you have a choice. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1505.56s)]
*  And this one former judge recently said this, who's retired. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1506.8799999999999s)]
*  He said that we have a choice in South Africa [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1510.16s)]
*  between a moral system that is dysfunctional, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1512.24s)]
*  which is the current system, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1515.6399999999999s)]
*  or an immoral system that is a functional one, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1517.08s)]
*  which is the former system. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1519.4s)]
*  And so the problem is if you criticize [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1520.92s)]
*  what's happening in South Africa now, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1522.48s)]
*  you get accused of wanting to return to the apartheid system. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1523.6399999999999s)]
*  But the truth is you can reject both. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1526.12s)]
*  You can say we don't want the apartheid system [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1528.12s)]
*  and we don't want what's happening in South Africa [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1530.08s)]
*  at the moment. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1532.2399999999998s)]
*  We want to govern ourselves. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1533.08s)]
*  We want freedom. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1534.2399999999998s)]
*  But it seems that a lot of people are incapable [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1536.32s)]
*  of making that conclusion or leaving any room [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1538.4799999999998s)]
*  for saying that both these systems are wrong [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1542.4399999999998s)]
*  and we need a better system, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1545.12s)]
*  a system that is much more decentralized, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1546.6399999999999s)]
*  a system in which the various nations [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1548.6799999999998s)]
*  who live in South Africa, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1551.4399999999998s)]
*  because South Africa is very big, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1552.4799999999998s)]
*  it's almost as big as Europe, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1553.84s)]
*  the various nations living in South Africa [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1555.84s)]
*  should just govern themselves. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1557.64s)]
*  And that's not what's happening in South Africa. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1559.44s)]
*  And I think it's a worthy cause to pursue. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1561.4s)]
*  So can I, I think I'm hardly an expert [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1564.4s)]
*  in South Africa at all, but I am American. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1567.96s)]
*  So if I, can I just give my overview of what, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1570.1200000000001s)]
*  of the different groups in South Africa? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  And you correct me, but just so people following on [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1574.5600000000002s)]
*  because I think it matters for reasons I'll explain. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1576.5200000000002s)]
*  So South Africa, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1578.3200000000002s)]
*  they're basically two big white populations [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1580.48s)]
*  in South Africa historically. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1582.3200000000002s)]
*  They're what we call the Boers, the Afrikaners, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1583.92s)]
*  who are, were religious, basically religious refugees, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1585.72s)]
*  the mixture of Dutch and French Huguenots, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1589.16s)]
*  Protestant Dutch, Protestant French, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1592.1200000000001s)]
*  who moved to Southern Africa [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1595.52s)]
*  for reasons of religious liberty, okay? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1598.08s)]
*  And then you had the English, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1600.72s)]
*  who I think were after the Boer war in power, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1602.2s)]
*  who mostly were there for economic reasons [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1607.44s)]
*  and had in many cases, passports back to Great Britain. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1610.8s)]
*  And then you had a couple of different African black groups, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1616.8799999999999s)]
*  the largest of which I think is to this day are the Zulus, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1621.32s)]
*  who like the Afrikaners, the Boers and the English [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1625.12s)]
*  were not native to the area at all. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1628.56s)]
*  They were newcomers who arrived, I think, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1631.3999999999999s)]
*  just right before the Boers did. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1634.2s)]
*  Yeah, not long before. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1635.68s)]
*  Okay, this is all true. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1637.12s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1638.32s)]
*  And they, as invading groups often usually do, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1639.36s)]
*  kind of exterminated the native population [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1644.76s)]
*  who were what we would call the Bushmen or. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1646.76s)]
*  Yeah, the Koi and the San as they are also called. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1649.1999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. Yes. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1651.28s)]
*  Okay, so that's my like dumb foreigner overview. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1652.32s)]
*  Is that roughly true? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1654.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1655.6s)]
*  So just, can I tell you a story from our history? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1656.56s)]
*  I hope you will. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1660.28s)]
*  Yes, it's, some people call it the origin story [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1661.12s)]
*  of the Afrikaner people. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1664.0s)]
*  And it explains a lot about who we are today. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1665.1599999999999s)]
*  So we were settled in the Cape, the proto-Afrikaners [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1669.24s)]
*  who were still the Dutch, the French and the Germans. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1672.0400000000002s)]
*  We were then colonized the Cape in, I think, 1810 [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1674.92s)]
*  by the British. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1677.8000000000002s)]
*  It was during the Napoleonic Wars. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1678.64s)]
*  When did the Afrikaners for the Boers first get there? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1680.4s)]
*  1652. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1684.1200000000001s)]
*  1652. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1685.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's 150 years [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1686.5600000000002s)]
*  before the Declaration of Independence or something. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1687.92s)]
*  Wow. Something like that. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1690.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1691.48s)]
*  A long time ago. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1692.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so my great, great, great grandfather, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1693.16s)]
*  Nicolas Rutz, who was the first Rutz [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1696.08s)]
*  who came to South Africa, came more or less the time [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1698.8799999999999s)]
*  when George Washington was a teenager. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1703.44s)]
*  So he was eight years older than George Washington. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1705.72s)]
*  So my family has been in Africa since, you could say, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1707.6399999999999s)]
*  since George Washington, since the time of George Washington. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1711.28s)]
*  So before the United States was a country. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1714.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1715.8s)]
*  So the Cape was- [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1717.76s)]
*  Do you have another passport? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1718.96s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1720.24s)]
*  I don't really want one. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1721.8799999999999s)]
*  And do most Afrikaners have other passports? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1724.6000000000001s)]
*  No, most don't. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1727.1200000000001s)]
*  But this goes to the story I want to tell you. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1729.3600000000001s)]
*  So we were colonized by the British [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1731.1200000000001s)]
*  and you can call them the proto-Afrikaners then said, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1734.6000000000001s)]
*  we don't want to be governed by anyone else. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1738.04s)]
*  We want to govern ourselves. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1739.6000000000001s)]
*  And so they opted to move into the interior of South Africa, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1741.2s)]
*  which was called the Great Track. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1744.72s)]
*  And they didn't know what they would expect. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1746.1200000000001s)]
*  They said they reject slavery. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1747.72s)]
*  They want to foster good relations with local tribes, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1749.24s)]
*  which they did. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1752.28s)]
*  They had many treaties signed and agreements and so forth. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1753.1599999999999s)]
*  And they did not hold slaves. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1756.28s)]
*  There was slavery in the Cape colony before that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1758.56s)]
*  But when the Great Track, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1761.52s)]
*  that was around the time of the abolition of slavery. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1763.08s)]
*  And they also rejected slavery. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1765.1999999999998s)]
*  They explicitly said so. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1766.76s)]
*  So they then went into the interior [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1769.56s)]
*  and the leader of the Great Track was a guy called Petra Tiff, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1771.08s)]
*  who went to negotiate with the Zulu King then gone. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1774.4799999999998s)]
*  And so he said, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1778.36s)]
*  what can we do to buy land from you for our people to live? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1779.1999999999998s)]
*  The agreement was they had to return cattle [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1782.8s)]
*  that was stolen by another tribe [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1785.08s)]
*  with a king called Sikoniela. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1786.84s)]
*  So they went, they retrieved the cattle. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1788.96s)]
*  They brought it to the Zulu King. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1790.48s)]
*  The Zulu King then gone, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1792.08s)]
*  King then gone said to them that we have to celebrate. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1793.28s)]
*  So leave your weapons outside the lager, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1796.28s)]
*  come inside and we'll have a celebration. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1798.32s)]
*  During the celebration at one stage, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1800.76s)]
*  he chanted, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1802.76s)]
*  Bula lani abatakati, which means kill the wizards. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1804.12s)]
*  So they took Retif and his commando, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1807.48s)]
*  his group to a nearby hill [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1809.56s)]
*  and they slaughtered them. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1811.84s)]
*  They slaughtered him last because they wanted him to see, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1813.36s)]
*  they wanted to make sure that he sees his people [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1816.28s)]
*  and his son murdered. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1818.6799999999998s)]
*  A few months later, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1821.36s)]
*  so after that, they went on an extermination mission. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1823.76s)]
*  They killed women and children in the lagers and so forth. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1826.12s)]
*  A few months later- [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1828.6799999999998s)]
*  A lager is a group of wagons pulled into a circle. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1829.52s)]
*  Yes, correct, yes. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1831.72s)]
*  And so a few months later, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1832.9199999999998s)]
*  his body was found with the treaty [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1834.24s)]
*  on which the Zulu King signed, giving them some land. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1836.1999999999998s)]
*  So they then initiated a punishment commando, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1841.12s)]
*  a group of three to 400 men to counter-attack the Zulus, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1845.56s)]
*  which eventually led to the Battle of Blood River, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1851.36s)]
*  one of the most significant battles in our history, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1854.08s)]
*  where they found themselves completely surrounded. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1857.0s)]
*  They were about, let's say 400. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1860.1599999999999s)]
*  But 400 boars. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1862.08s)]
*  Yes, surrounded by 12,000 Zulus. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1863.04s)]
*  And so they had this wagon [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1866.52s)]
*  and my great-great-great-great-grandfather [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1868.2s)]
*  was in that lager and he was the religious leader. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1870.56s)]
*  His name is Sadal Saleha. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1873.3600000000001s)]
*  So Sadal Saleha's- [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1875.1200000000001s)]
*  And what was their religion? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1876.2s)]
*  Christian. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1877.6000000000001s)]
*  Dutch reform? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1878.44s)]
*  Dutch reform, yes. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1879.26s)]
*  So he said to them, listen, we need to make a vow to God. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1880.1000000000001s)]
*  And so he wrote a vow, which they all made. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1883.6000000000001s)]
*  And the vow said that we're standing here [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1886.88s)]
*  in front of the God in heaven and earth [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1889.6000000000001s)]
*  to make a vow to him that if he protects us [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1892.0800000000002s)]
*  in the battle that lies ahead, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1894.72s)]
*  we will commemorate this day in the years to come [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1896.56s)]
*  as a day of thanksgiving and a Sabbath. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1900.04s)]
*  And we will also tell our children the story [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1903.0s)]
*  and we will build a church and we will make sure [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1905.0s)]
*  that the honor of the victory goes to God and not to us. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1906.84s)]
*  So they made this vow and the battle took place. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1911.06s)]
*  And the result was that not one of the Afrikaners [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1914.0s)]
*  were killed, 3,000 Zulus died in that battle. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1917.6s)]
*  Not one was killed? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1921.0s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1922.26s)]
*  And so the reason why I'm telling this story [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1924.54s)]
*  is not to point to the Zulu people. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1927.26s)]
*  We have good relations with the Zulu [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1929.5s)]
*  and we've worked with them. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1930.78s)]
*  This was of course the one major battle, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1931.74s)]
*  but we've had good relations with them over the years. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1933.26s)]
*  But it says something about firstly, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1935.78s)]
*  why the Afrikaner people are so patriotic. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1938.3s)]
*  It says something about why we are so attached [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1941.1599999999999s)]
*  to African soil and why we are still religious. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1943.5s)]
*  We're a very religious community. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1946.62s)]
*  We have some problems in terms of belief and so forth. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1947.9599999999998s)]
*  But broadly speaking, the Afrikaners are compared to Europe [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1950.6999999999998s)]
*  and compared to some parts of America, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1954.26s)]
*  still a very religious people. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1955.86s)]
*  And it also says something about why we are so attached [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1958.26s)]
*  to the country and why we don't want to leave. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1961.16s)]
*  We want to stay there because our ancestors [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1962.94s)]
*  have been there for hundreds of years. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1965.14s)]
*  And we fought and died for our space there. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1966.78s)]
*  And we've gotten used to it to a certain extent. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1969.54s)]
*  What's the only country that you have, isn't it? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1971.9s)]
*  Exactly, we don't have any other country. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1973.9s)]
*  Like we can't go back to England. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1975.98s)]
*  We're not Dutch anymore. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1979.02s)]
*  There's this slogan in South Africa [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1981.32s)]
*  that says go back to Holland. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1983.48s)]
*  But I mean, I've been to Holland, I've been to Amsterdam. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1985.24s)]
*  It's a beautiful city, but I don't feel like I'm at home [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1987.36s)]
*  when I go there. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1991.72s)]
*  It's a beautiful foreign city that I'm attending. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1992.56s)]
*  We became a people in Africa, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1994.3799999999999s)]
*  which is why we are called the Afrikaners. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1996.96s)]
*  We named ourselves after the continent [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=1998.84s)]
*  and our language Afrikaans is named after the continent. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2000.7s)]
*  But you're being called invaders [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2003.4399999999998s)]
*  by people whose ancestors were also invaders. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2004.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well, who came from the North of Africa. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2007.2s)]
*  From where Cameroon is and so forth. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2009.4s)]
*  Who came down firstly towards the East of Africa [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2012.0800000000002s)]
*  and then along the Great Lakes, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2014.68s)]
*  eventually ending in South Africa, yes. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2016.48s)]
*  I think it's what you said is really important [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2022.8400000000001s)]
*  because I think from the American or the Western perspective, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2024.4s)]
*  there's this idea that the Afrikaners, the Boers are worse. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2027.7s)]
*  They're the worst whites there, worse than the English. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2032.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2035.6000000000001s)]
*  The English, you by the way, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2037.0s)]
*  created the concentration camp during the Boer War. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2037.84s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2040.24s)]
*  Winston Churchill was there [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2041.92s)]
*  and kind of behaved pretty dishonorably, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2043.72s)]
*  I would say on many, many levels [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2047.32s)]
*  for hundreds of years in South Africa, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2048.76s)]
*  but that's just my opinion. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2050.28s)]
*  But that the Boers are somehow the worst [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2051.76s)]
*  and that they have no right to be there. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2053.98s)]
*  And I think history suggests something different. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2057.72s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2060.32s)]
*  So on my mother's side, I descend from the British. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2061.44s)]
*  My great grandfather fought in the First World War [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2063.88s)]
*  for the British. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2067.6000000000004s)]
*  And so in many ways, culturally, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2068.44s)]
*  we've become very close to the British [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2070.6800000000003s)]
*  because of the influence over the years. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2072.44s)]
*  And I don't think there's friction today [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2074.48s)]
*  between the Afrikaners and the British, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2076.2400000000002s)]
*  but it certainly is the case. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2078.32s)]
*  I mean, the concentration camps were horrible. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2079.48s)]
*  I recently read the Gulag Archipelago [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2082.0s)]
*  and Solzhenitsyn writes in there [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2084.48s)]
*  that the first concentration camps [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2085.82s)]
*  were invented by the Soviets, but that's actually wrong. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2088.04s)]
*  The first concentration camps that we know of, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2091.04s)]
*  at least this type of concentration camps, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2093.6800000000003s)]
*  were during the Anglo-Boer War [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2095.52s)]
*  where about 30,000 women and children died. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2097.6s)]
*  But there was a lot of, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2101.0s)]
*  the great thing about the Anglo-Boer War [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2101.84s)]
*  was that it was in many ways a first for the world. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2104.28s)]
*  It was, some people call it [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2107.52s)]
*  the First International Propaganda War [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2108.52s)]
*  because it was in a time when newspapers became popular. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2110.66s)]
*  So there was this propaganda war in Europe [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2113.42s)]
*  with regard to the Boers or the Boer War [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2116.58s)]
*  with a lot of people saying the Boers are Boerish. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2119.8s)]
*  That's where the word comes from. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2122.4s)]
*  Evidently, if someone told me [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2124.48s)]
*  that's where the word Boerish comes from, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2125.68s)]
*  it's to be sort of very old style [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2127.08s)]
*  and not very sophisticated. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2130.44s)]
*  Rough, yeah. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2132.52s)]
*  Yeah, rough around the edges. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2133.36s)]
*  And so there was a lot of propaganda [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2134.72s)]
*  like the Boers being compared to wild hogs [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2136.12s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2139.2s)]
*  But that's okay. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2141.52s)]
*  The word Boer was actually used for a long time [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2143.04s)]
*  as an insult, almost like Jew, like calling someone a Jew. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2145.44s)]
*  It's like, oh, you're a Boer, a typical Boer. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2148.16s)]
*  But I mean, we're very proud of that word. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2150.36s)]
*  It's something that we take pride in. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2152.64s)]
*  In many ways, there's some debate [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2156.04s)]
*  about the difference between Boer and Africana, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2157.2000000000003s)]
*  but it's broadly speaking synonymous. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2159.1800000000003s)]
*  But I mean, we're very proud of our history in South Africa [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2162.0s)]
*  and we've become a very sophisticated community [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2164.16s)]
*  with an immense treasure chest of literature, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2167.16s)]
*  of poetry, of philosophy, all of it in our own language [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2170.2400000000002s)]
*  that we did over the last, especially the last 100 years, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2173.4s)]
*  which of course is under threat now. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2176.48s)]
*  Your language not spoken by anyone else in the world. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2178.32s)]
*  No, it descends from Dutch. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2180.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2183.46s)]
*  And so if you spend some time as an Africana person [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2184.3s)]
*  with some Dutch friends, eventually you start to follow, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2188.2200000000003s)]
*  but it's not Dutch anymore. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2191.86s)]
*  There's been influences by other languages and so forth. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2193.86s)]
*  So there are people who speak it all over the world, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2196.9s)]
*  but that's only because people who have left from, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2200.5s)]
*  so many people have left from South Africa. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2202.9s)]
*  Some estimates say it's about a million people, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2204.4s)]
*  white people who have left South Africa [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2206.5600000000004s)]
*  over the last few decades. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2208.34s)]
*  How many are left? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2209.5s)]
*  How many whites overall in South Africa [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2211.3s)]
*  and how many of them are African? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2213.26s)]
*  So it's more or less about five million who are left. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2214.94s)]
*  The Africana community is about 2.7 million. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2218.02s)]
*  Yeah, and the total population is about 60, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2220.66s)]
*  just over 60 million. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2222.66s)]
*  And now it looks like you're, as you said, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2225.7s)]
*  entering some kind of final stage where they'll be, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2229.3s)]
*  I mean, they've been expelled [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2232.9s)]
*  from a bunch of different African countries, as you know. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2234.02s)]
*  But it sounds like the plan is to force them to leave [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2237.62s)]
*  or kill them or what is the plan exactly? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2241.58s)]
*  So Jan Smuts, the famous Bua General, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2243.5s)]
*  who worked with Churchill also famously said [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2247.1s)]
*  that South Africa is a country [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2249.7s)]
*  where the best never happens and the worst never happens. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2250.8199999999997s)]
*  And so we sort of believe that, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2253.66s)]
*  and we hope that the worst outcome is an unrealistic outcome. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2255.54s)]
*  We do know that the most important thing [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2259.16s)]
*  that we need to do now is to be very well organized [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2260.86s)]
*  in terms of our own communities, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2263.9s)]
*  to be very well connected to each other. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2265.76s)]
*  There's this whole debate about the individual [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2269.6800000000003s)]
*  and the community in philosophy. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2271.34s)]
*  And we've realized that if you're just an individual, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2272.8s)]
*  you are completely helpless. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2275.4s)]
*  If you're not part of a community, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2276.5600000000004s)]
*  if you're not given meaning by the community [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2278.48s)]
*  of which you are a member, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2281.36s)]
*  you're completely helpless against the Leviathan, the state. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2282.8s)]
*  So we need to be well organized, we need to be armed, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2287.48s)]
*  we need to have well-functioning communities [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2290.36s)]
*  to look after each other, look after the poor, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2293.96s)]
*  do all the things that the government's supposed to be doing, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2295.96s)]
*  but also look after our safety. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2298.2200000000003s)]
*  So we drive patrols at night, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2299.62s)]
*  we're involved with tens of thousands of volunteers [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2301.2s)]
*  involved with patrols, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2304.28s)]
*  looking after our own safety and so forth. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2305.36s)]
*  But I think the bigger question here [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2307.88s)]
*  is the future of South Africa. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2310.2s)]
*  And this is a controversial thing to say, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2312.28s)]
*  but it's so obvious that it's not sustainable. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2314.12s)]
*  It's not going to work and it's just getting worse. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2317.76s)]
*  So the only possible solution is not simply to say [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2321.16s)]
*  we need a different party in power [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2324.52s)]
*  because the underlying foundations is still problematic. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2326.56s)]
*  The only possible solution is to move toward a system [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2330.2799999999997s)]
*  with subsidiary authorities, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2333.3799999999997s)]
*  which could imply something like a republic [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2335.54s)]
*  for the Afrikaner people, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2337.8199999999997s)]
*  it could imply a kingdom for the Zulu people, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2338.92s)]
*  it could imply different types of authority [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2341.24s)]
*  depending on the community. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2343.8399999999997s)]
*  But South Africa is a country made up [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2345.8599999999997s)]
*  of a long list of minorities. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2348.02s)]
*  If you look at it from a racial perspective, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2350.52s)]
*  you can say there's a black majority, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2352.2799999999997s)]
*  but the black majority also consists of a variety, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2354.96s)]
*  as you mentioned, a variety of nations and tribes [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2358.0s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2360.04s)]
*  And plus massive immigration into your country. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2360.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very serious problem. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2363.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we virtually don't have borders in South Africa. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2365.52s)]
*  Right, and a problem of course for the country, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2367.88s)]
*  but also a demographic fact [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2370.12s)]
*  that it's not as if there's this monolithic black majority, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2372.48s)]
*  there are all kinds of different components [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2376.36s)]
*  of the black majority, right? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2377.9s)]
*  Don't necessarily get along. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2379.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2381.0s)]
*  But a lot of Zimbabweans murdered in South Africa. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2381.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, this xenophobic violence, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2383.8799999999997s)]
*  every now and then there's this upsurge [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2385.72s)]
*  in violence against foreigners. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2387.3999999999996s)]
*  So they get accused, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2389.4199999999996s)]
*  what typically happens is people come in from the North, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2390.2599999999998s)]
*  the North of South Africa, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2393.0s)]
*  like Malawi, Zimbabwe and so forth, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2394.2799999999997s)]
*  Zambia and so forth. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2395.96s)]
*  And then they work and they accept jobs for lower wages. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2397.16s)]
*  And a lot of them work really hard. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2400.72s)]
*  So that leads to friction [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2403.3199999999997s)]
*  because there's very high unemployment [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2404.3999999999996s)]
*  in South Africa already. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2406.0s)]
*  And so it leads to friction among the local communities. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2407.4s)]
*  And then every now and then we have this upsurge [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2411.7200000000003s)]
*  in very, very brutal xenophobic violence. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2413.84s)]
*  And so yes, the border is, it's virtually non-existent, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2417.2400000000002s)]
*  the border to the North of South Africa. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2420.4s)]
*  If you've been paying attention, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2421.98s)]
*  you know that ALP is not just another nicotine pouch, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2423.12s)]
*  it is literally the best nicotine pouch in the world. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2426.36s)]
*  And we know because we use it all day long, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2431.44s)]
*  we've used all of them. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2433.84s)]
*  Turns out you can actually make money [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2434.88s)]
*  by telling people about ALP. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2436.0s)]
*  So we're launching our affiliate program. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2438.2000000000003s)]
*  If you have an audience, big or small, you can cash in. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2440.32s)]
*  You earn 10% commission on every sale of ALP [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2442.4s)]
*  that you bring in. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2444.96s)]
*  And to make it even easier, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2446.04s)]

*  By the way, compared to all the other products [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2451.92s)]
*  people sell online, ALP is truly good. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2453.2400000000002s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2456.6000000000004s)]
*  It is easy to sell because it's heartfelt. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2457.84s)]
*  So spread the word, get rewarded for it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2460.0800000000004s)]
*  Best nicotine pouch in the world. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2461.88s)]
*  What did it look like to have autonomous republics? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2467.32s)]
*  And is that allowed under your 94 Constitution? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2470.84s)]
*  I thought there was some provision for that. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2473.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, it's interesting that you know this, yes. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2476.7200000000003s)]
*  So there's a section in the South African Constitution, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2479.0s)]
*  Section 235, that provides for self-determination [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2481.6800000000003s)]
*  for communities. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2485.84s)]
*  Now there's some ambiguity in terms of [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2486.7200000000003s)]
*  how to interpret that section, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2488.48s)]
*  but there is some constitutional provision for that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2490.4s)]
*  And so during the 90s, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2494.0s)]
*  the negotiations for a new South Africa, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2495.8799999999997s)]
*  the more conservative groups who were white and black, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2497.52s)]
*  who were arguing for self-determination were made fun of [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2500.68s)]
*  by the ruling party at the time, the National Party, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2504.12s)]
*  and the ANC of course, and also some Westerners. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2507.8799999999997s)]
*  This is just backwards, this idea of governing yourself [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2510.6s)]
*  is somehow an old ancient thing [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2513.2799999999997s)]
*  that we should move away from. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2515.16s)]
*  And part of the problem, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2517.16s)]
*  part of the reason why they were made fun of [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2518.72s)]
*  is the question is how do you do that practically? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2520.2s)]
*  And the only way to practically do that [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2523.08s)]
*  is to have areas where people live concentrated, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2525.0s)]
*  where people form a de facto majority. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2527.64s)]
*  And there are such areas, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2531.44s)]
*  like for example, when you talk about the Zulus and so forth, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2532.72s)]
*  the Afrikaner people are pretty much dispersed, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2535.48s)]
*  although there are some areas [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2537.68s)]
*  where we live more concentrated. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2538.84s)]
*  But there's for example, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2541.16s)]
*  and there are some initiatives to get Afrikaners [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2542.0s)]
*  to move closer together. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2544.16s)]
*  And I think that's a solution [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2545.32s)]
*  that we need to really focus on, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2547.4s)]
*  is getting the Afrikaners to move closer together. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2548.92s)]
*  So they're clustered in Pretoria was my understanding. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2550.56s)]
*  The majority, yes. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2552.48s)]
*  Pretoria and then the Western Cape [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2554.12s)]
*  and the south of the country. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2556.56s)]
*  And then there's this Orania initiative in the Northern Cape. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2558.0s)]
*  So tell us about that. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2560.92s)]
*  What is Orania? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2562.24s)]
*  So Orania is a cultural community. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2563.36s)]
*  It's an Afrikaner cultural community. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2565.84s)]
*  It's fairly small. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2567.92s)]
*  It's about 3000 people, but it's growing rapidly. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2569.0s)]
*  It's growing by about 12 to 15% per year. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2571.6s)]
*  And the idea is it's privately owned. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2574.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a community where the Afrikaner culture [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2578.0s)]
*  can survive and flourish. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2580.24s)]
*  And it has been growing at quite a pace, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2582.4s)]
*  even though it's from a small base. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2585.76s)]
*  But the idea is to say this is an area. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2587.1600000000003s)]
*  We are the majority and we make our own decisions. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2589.32s)]
*  We make our own laws. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2592.76s)]
*  We govern ourselves. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2593.8s)]
*  We make our own decisions in terms of what happens [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2594.84s)]
*  with our tax money, what happens with our streets, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2596.92s)]
*  what type of monuments. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2600.0s)]
*  Do you murder other people or oppress other people? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2600.84s)]
*  No. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2603.2400000000002s)]
*  Then why, maybe you have an answer to this, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2605.56s)]
*  a neighborhood, a community of 3000 people, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2608.4s)]
*  which is tiny, even by South African standards, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2612.12s)]
*  has received unrelenting negative media attention [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2615.68s)]
*  in the West. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2619.3599999999997s)]
*  Why is that such a moral crime, such an outrage, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2620.2s)]
*  to have a community like that? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2624.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's bizarre the extent to which Orania [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2625.68s)]
*  has been attacked, especially in the international media. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2628.3599999999997s)]
*  So I spoke with a friend in Europe recently who said to me, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2631.4s)]
*  I've only read negative things about Orania, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2634.64s)]
*  but that's why I like it. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2637.64s)]
*  Because I know who's writing this. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2639.7599999999998s)]
*  A lot of us have reached that conclusion. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2641.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2642.88s)]
*  And so in South Africa, there are many traditional- [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2643.7200000000003s)]
*  The lying is, can I just pause and just say, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2646.52s)]
*  the lying is unsustainable. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2649.28s)]
*  When you open up the New York Times and it's a safe bet [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2650.88s)]
*  that whatever they're telling you is the opposite [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2654.92s)]
*  of the truth, then you've reached a point where it's like, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2656.48s)]
*  why even have media coverage at that point? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2658.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2660.48s)]
*  Yeah, so in South Africa, there are many cultural communities [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2661.32s)]
*  like Zulu communities, different, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2663.92s)]
*  let's say there are many black cultural communities. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2665.2400000000002s)]
*  And when they are reported on by the media, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2667.16s)]
*  they would say this Zulu cultural community, so and so, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2669.44s)]
*  or this Zulu cultural community is doing this. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2674.28s)]
*  But when it's Orania, they say it's a white-only enclave. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2676.48s)]
*  That's the term they use, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2679.68s)]
*  even though it's a cultural community. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2680.68s)]
*  So black communities can have that. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2682.48s)]
*  What is that? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2684.28s)]
*  Why the hostility? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2685.12s)]
*  And that's true globally, by the way. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2687.68s)]
*  There's no any white majority country. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2689.2400000000002s)]
*  There are very few left. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2691.88s)]
*  Very few left, but there's just suspect [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2695.56s)]
*  because they exist. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2698.44s)]
*  What is that? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2699.64s)]
*  I think it's underpinned by orcophobia, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2700.56s)]
*  this idea of just hating your own people [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2703.28s)]
*  and wanting your own people to go down. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2705.8s)]
*  It is strange. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2707.84s)]
*  I'm not mad at China for being 99% Chinese or whatever. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2708.76s)]
*  I just, I'm not mad at Burundi for being all black. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2714.44s)]
*  It just never even interests my mind. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2718.04s)]
*  What is that? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2720.12s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2720.96s)]
*  I mean, honestly, I guess now we can ask questions like this. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2722.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2726.32s)]
*  Do you have any idea? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2727.1600000000003s)]
*  I honestly think it's underpinned by [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2728.56s)]
*  an enormous sense of guilt within Western society [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2731.44s)]
*  or the Western world, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2735.88s)]
*  not knowing how to make sense of the Second World War [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2737.12s)]
*  and being influenced over decades and centuries [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2740.6800000000003s)]
*  by enlightened philosophy that talks about [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2744.2000000000003s)]
*  how you are the problem [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2747.4s)]
*  and how you should have a sense of guilt for who you are. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2749.0s)]
*  And the idea that community and identity is a bad thing, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2752.36s)]
*  but it's not a bad thing [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2757.12s)]
*  if it's someone else. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2758.08s)]
*  Well, not only is it not a bad thing, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2759.6s)]
*  it's required by law. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2760.88s)]
*  Community and identity, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2763.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, those are like the buzzwords of the moment, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2764.36s)]
*  but those are, I mean, basically it's just like, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2766.84s)]
*  everyone hates whites, including a lot of whites. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2770.12s)]
*  And I just don't understand that. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2772.04s)]
*  I am white, but I'm kind of agnostic on the question. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2773.92s)]
*  I kind of like all people. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2777.84s)]
*  I think they're all created by God, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2779.2799999999997s)]
*  but we're required to pretend this isn't happening, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2780.96s)]
*  but it is happening. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2783.64s)]
*  Everybody hates the whites and wants them to die. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2784.96s)]
*  Where does that come from? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2788.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's primarily a Western thing. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2789.08s)]
*  But what's the root of it? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2791.76s)]
*  I think it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2794.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2795.6s)]
*  And by the way, if everyone wanted Malaysians to die [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2796.44s)]
*  or something, I would say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2798.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, whatever Malaysia has done through the years, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2801.68s)]
*  like you can't attack people [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2804.12s)]
*  on the basis of their Malaysian-ness. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2806.28s)]
*  That's just wrong. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2807.88s)]
*  I would say that, and I would mean it too. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2808.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2810.7200000000003s)]
*  But it's considered a crime to say that about whites? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2811.56s)]
*  Like, where does that come from? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2813.28s)]
*  I'm honestly baffled. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2816.0400000000004s)]
*  Do you have any idea? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2817.4s)]
*  No, I can only speculate. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2818.52s)]
*  I think some part of this orcophobia, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2819.6800000000003s)]
*  I honestly think enlightenment philosophy [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2821.4s)]
*  has played a big role in this. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2823.4s)]
*  I think the influence of ideas about power structures [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2825.52s)]
*  and all these stuff that's coming from America, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2831.28s)]
*  it used to come from Europe. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2833.96s)]
*  Maybe, but the Chinese have an awful lot of power in Asia, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2835.0800000000004s)]
*  and I never heard anybody say you should like, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2836.92s)]
*  it's outrageous that China's 95% Han or something. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2839.6s)]
*  Not even a thing. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2843.7599999999998s)]
*  It's something about, well, as they say in our universities, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2844.7599999999998s)]
*  whiteness is uniquely offensive. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2848.24s)]
*  It's uniquely, and I don't think [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2851.7999999999997s)]
*  that's a product of enlightenment philosophy [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2852.96s)]
*  because, I mean, this is a new thing. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2854.92s)]
*  This is post-war. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2857.92s)]
*  The Second World War did this in some way [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2858.88s)]
*  that I don't fully understand. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2860.32s)]
*  I don't understand at all, actually. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2861.68s)]
*  I think, so, Alisdair McIntyre has an explanation [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2863.24s)]
*  of how to make sense, how we derailed [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2869.16s)]
*  in trying to make sense of the Second World War. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2873.04s)]
*  I mean, obviously, Hitler was evil and all of that. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2875.0s)]
*  I mean, no one disagrees with that. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2876.7599999999998s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2877.9599999999996s)]
*  But, so, the wrong lesson from the Second World War [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2878.7999999999997s)]
*  is that nationalism is evil, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2882.56s)]
*  or a sense of pride in your identity is evil. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2884.9599999999996s)]
*  And there are a lot of people [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2887.8399999999997s)]
*  who would really like us to believe this, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2888.68s)]
*  that we need to abolish communal identities. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2890.16s)]
*  McIntyre's line- [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2893.3999999999996s)]
*  Only when they're white. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2894.6s)]
*  Yes, yes, yeah, of course. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2895.8399999999997s)]
*  It's actually, I don't think anyone thought [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2897.44s)]
*  the lesson of the war was that nationalism is evil, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2899.04s)]
*  only that nationalism when whites do it. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2900.96s)]
*  Yeah, when whites do it, yeah. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2902.6s)]
*  So McIntyre's line is that a sense of communal identity [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2904.04s)]
*  and pursuing what is good for your people is a good. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2908.48s)]
*  And what went wrong with the Second World War [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2911.6s)]
*  was that Hitler was trying to pursue this good [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2913.88s)]
*  at the expense of all other goods. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2916.32s)]
*  He was detaching this one thing from everything else. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2918.4s)]
*  And you cannot do that without committing evil [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2920.92s)]
*  and inflicting evil. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2923.44s)]
*  And so I think it's a bizarre situation [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2924.88s)]
*  where we are in currently, but- [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2929.08s)]
*  So I thought and think that the lesson of the Second World War [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2930.76s)]
*  was that targeting people for violence and discrimination, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2934.36s)]
*  but especially violence, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2938.56s)]
*  on the basis of their immutable genetic characteristics [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2939.84s)]
*  was wrong. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2944.2000000000003s)]
*  Like that's what I was taught. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2945.04s)]
*  I believed that then. It's inherently evil. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2946.44s)]
*  I believe that now as much as I've ever believed it. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2948.08s)]
*  And, but it's just crazy to see people say that [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2951.52s)]
*  on the one hand, and then for a lot of people, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2954.84s)]
*  a lot of our leaders, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2958.44s)]
*  the lesson of the Second World War was no, that's good. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2959.28s)]
*  Actually, you need to target more people [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2962.0800000000004s)]
*  on the basis of their immutable ethnic characteristics, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2964.28s)]
*  their whiteness, and kill them. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2966.5600000000004s)]
*  Like that's the lesson? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2970.2000000000003s)]
*  That's the opposite lesson, right? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2971.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2974.0s)]
*  Well, so in South Africa, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2974.84s)]
*  and this is part of the bizarre part of it [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2976.04s)]

*  they would write in their own policy documents. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2981.0s)]
*  They say, our ideology is a blend of race, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2983.7200000000003s)]
*  nationalism, and socialism. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2986.76s)]
*  That's literally what Nazi means. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2988.8s)]
*  Now I'm not saying they're Nazis, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2991.04s)]
*  but in some sense they're calling themselves Nazis. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2992.28s)]
*  If they say, we promote a combination of race, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2995.08s)]
*  nationalism, and socialism. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2997.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think people can hear themselves. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=2998.52s)]
*  I mean, I think even this conversation will be like, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3000.36s)]
*  oh, that's a Nazi conversation. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3003.84s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no, no. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3005.1600000000003s)]
*  We're arguing, I'll speak for myself. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3006.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm arguing against what I thought the core idea was, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3008.28s)]
*  or the core bad idea in the Second World War, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3013.1200000000003s)]
*  which is that you should attack people, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3014.92s)]
*  hurt people, because of how they were born. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3017.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm just- Based on who they are. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3019.5600000000004s)]
*  Always been opposed to that. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3021.0800000000004s)]

*  But now it's like complaining about it makes, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3024.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know, it's all so- [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3028.2400000000002s)]
*  You're not even allowed to say this as this talk. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3030.0400000000004s)]
*  It's also fake. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3031.4s)]
*  It's also fake. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3032.52s)]
*  Like it's actually, this is all a cover [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3033.52s)]
*  for something much more sinister [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3035.32s)]
*  that is not really related to the Second World War. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3037.24s)]
*  I just don't think, because it doesn't make any sense. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3039.56s)]
*  As an intellectual exercise, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3041.8399999999997s)]
*  you just immediately hit a brick wall. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3042.9599999999996s)]
*  Like what you're saying is nonsensical, right? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3045.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's difficult to make sense of it [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3048.68s)]
*  because it's completely irrational. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3051.7599999999998s)]
*  It's completely irrational. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3053.4799999999996s)]
*  Therefore, I think it's a lie, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3054.7999999999997s)]
*  because it doesn't even, like you don't even, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3057.6s)]
*  I don't have especially high IQ, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3059.4399999999996s)]
*  and it's super obvious to me [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3060.9199999999996s)]
*  that it doesn't make any sense. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3062.7599999999998s)]
*  So like what, really, I guess there's no answer. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3063.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know the answer, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3066.48s)]
*  but there's something very deep going on here [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3067.88s)]
*  where the leaders of every country in the world [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3070.56s)]
*  all of a sudden decide this one ethnic group [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3072.96s)]
*  needs to be killed. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3074.92s)]
*  Like what? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3075.88s)]
*  I think one part of it is something that you've said before, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3077.08s)]
*  which is affluence. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3079.64s)]
*  The people in the Western world have become very affluent, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3081.0s)]
*  and unfortunately, as a result of that, very self-centered, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3084.16s)]
*  and in many ways, they've become disconnected [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3088.2400000000002s)]
*  from their communities, disconnected from their tradition. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3090.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's no doubt about that. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3093.2s)]
*  But I mean, I just spent a lot of time in the Gulf, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3095.4s)]
*  in the Persian Gulf, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3099.2400000000002s)]
*  the most affluent countries in the world per capita, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3100.76s)]
*  I think. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3103.52s)]
*  I mean, they are. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3104.88s)]
*  And whatever you think of them, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3106.2000000000003s)]
*  you don't see a lot of Arab leaders being like, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3108.88s)]
*  we really were too Arab. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3110.48s)]
*  That's the problem, where I hate myself for my Arabness. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3112.6400000000003s)]
*  Like that doesn't even occur to them, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3115.08s)]
*  to their great credit, by the way. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3116.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't think self-hatred's ever good. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3118.92s)]
*  I don't think hating anybody in the base of race [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3120.4s)]
*  is ever good. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3122.0s)]
*  It's only this one group that does it. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3123.84s)]
*  I'd like to believe, and I hope that I'm right, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3126.96s)]
*  that it's a minority within the Western world [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3129.6000000000004s)]
*  that really believes this stuff. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3132.28s)]
*  I think. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3133.48s)]
*  But they have significant power and influence. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3134.32s)]
*  Why do they? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3136.2400000000002s)]
*  They are the editors of newspapers, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3137.08s)]
*  they are the prime ministers, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3138.48s)]
*  they are professors at universities and so forth. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3139.96s)]
*  And those are the people who's promoting this type of idea. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3142.88s)]
*  And I think most hardworking, ordinary people [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3145.76s)]
*  don't fall for this. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3148.44s)]
*  Well, certainly most authentic Christians [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3149.28s)]
*  reject it out of hand immediately. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3151.4s)]
*  It's essentially anti-Christian in many ways. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3154.08s)]
*  It is the definition of anti-Christian, I think. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3156.04s)]
*  I mean, that's my, what do I know? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3158.6400000000003s)]
*  Don't take theology advice from me. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3160.1600000000003s)]
*  But that's certainly my truest, deepest belief [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3161.36s)]
*  that this is immoral, no matter who it's done to. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3165.96s)]
*  I should have said this at the end of the essay, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3170.52s)]
*  but one of the reasons there's been this real change [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3171.44s)]
*  in people's willingness in the West [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3176.1200000000003s)]
*  to talk about what's happening in South Africa [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3177.6400000000003s)]
*  in an honest way, not with the false pieties [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3179.76s)]
*  of Desmond Tutu was so great. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3182.88s)]
*  Whatever Desmond, you know, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3184.8s)]
*  you think of Desmond Tutu, not much. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3185.7200000000003s)]
*  But we were required to talk about South Africa [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3187.76s)]
*  in a very specific way and to repeat certain cliches [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3190.76s)]
*  at really a gunpoint. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3194.48s)]
*  And that's changed in the past couple of months. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3196.76s)]
*  And it's really changed due to a South African emigre [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3199.5600000000004s)]
*  called Elon Musk. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3203.5600000000004s)]
*  This is my perspective, you tell me yours. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3205.6000000000004s)]
*  But he has made it possible through X, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3207.32s)]
*  but also through statements he's made on X [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3209.88s)]
*  to say the obvious, which is this is a crime [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3212.1200000000003s)]
*  against a beleaguered minority on the, you know, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3214.4s)]
*  this is racism against human beings and it's wrong. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3216.6400000000003s)]
*  Do you feel that? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3220.28s)]
*  Yes, so I don't know how much of what is in his biography [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3221.92s)]
*  by Isaacson is true, but it does seem from his biography [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3225.84s)]
*  that he's had some bad experiences growing up [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3228.84s)]
*  in South Africa, which is unfortunate. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3231.52s)]
*  And we were, we're still not sure quite how attached [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3234.44s)]
*  he still is to South Africa as a country, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3238.7599999999998s)]
*  but looking at his X and his comments, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3240.4s)]
*  it's very clear that he's interested. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3242.12s)]
*  And the strange thing is even though some people [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3244.24s)]
*  are very angry with him for speaking about South Africa, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3246.8399999999997s)]
*  the only thing that he's really doing [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3249.08s)]
*  is he's picking up a mirror and he's saying, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3251.12s)]
*  look at what's happening in South Africa. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3253.64s)]
*  And he's just, he's retweeting videos [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3255.08s)]
*  from rallies in South Africa. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3258.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3260.0s)]
*  He's literally just saying to people, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3260.88s)]
*  look at this stuff that's happening in South Africa. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3262.56s)]
*  Now, what do you think of this? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3264.7999999999997s)]
*  Are you okay with this? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3265.84s)]
*  No, no, I think, well, a lot of people, I think, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3266.68s)]
*  I can speak for a lot of people in saying [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3269.48s)]
*  that we're really, really grateful [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3271.2799999999997s)]
*  for what Elon Musk is doing to shed light [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3272.72s)]
*  on what is happening in South Africa. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3276.12s)]
*  It must be so weird to live in a country [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3277.2799999999997s)]
*  that has received so much attention from Western media, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3279.52s)]
*  so much attention. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3282.64s)]
*  I mean, there's no other country in Africa [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3284.44s)]
*  where your average American knows the name [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3285.68s)]
*  of three famous people. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3287.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3289.08s)]
*  There's not even close. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3289.92s)]
*  Name three famous people from Congo. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3291.7599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3294.7999999999997s)]
*  But every American knows about Nelson Mandela, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3297.2s)]
*  probably Winnie Mandela, Desmond Tutu. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3299.08s)]
*  Jan Smuts was also very big, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3302.04s)]
*  who became this Buet general, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3304.56s)]
*  who was a advisor to Churchill. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3305.7599999999998s)]
*  Of course, and then joined the English in the, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3308.3599999999997s)]
*  I think in the First World War, like right, you know. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3309.56s)]
*  Yes, first and second World War. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3312.12s)]
*  Right, but the First World War was, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3314.12s)]
*  not even 15 years after the Boer War. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3316.52s)]
*  So that was a pretty remarkable decision that he made. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3318.52s)]
*  I don't think most people are that in tune, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3322.08s)]
*  but they know the big outlines, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3323.7200000000003s)]
*  but of what happened post-94, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3325.32s)]
*  and they know all about apartheid and all that. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3328.7200000000003s)]
*  But it must be so weird to be living in this country [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3331.32s)]
*  where all this stuff is happening [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3334.52s)]
*  and nobody is saying anything about it. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3336.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3339.32s)]
*  It really is. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3341.2400000000002s)]
*  And I have to say the last few months [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3342.08s)]
*  has been quite a ride in terms of what we, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3344.92s)]
*  you know, the executive order signed by President Trump [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3347.6800000000003s)]
*  and the statements coming from the US. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3351.1200000000003s)]
*  Tell us about that executive order, if you don't mind. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3351.96s)]
*  So the executive order is a very strong reprimanding [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3354.32s)]
*  of what the South African government is doing. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3357.76s)]
*  It says that the South African government is, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3360.28s)]
*  well, as Trump said, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3362.48s)]
*  is treating certain sections of society very badly. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3363.36s)]
*  And that the US- [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3368.8s)]
*  Sorry, that's the Trumpiest thing ever said. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3369.6400000000003s)]
*  And the US will not stand for this. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3374.92s)]
*  And so it boils down to sanctions in an important way, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3376.88s)]
*  which is not, on one part of it says [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3381.28s)]
*  that they will grant refugee status to Afrikaners [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3383.8s)]
*  if they want to go to the US, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3387.1600000000003s)]
*  which I don't think in all fairness, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3389.56s)]
*  we're really grateful for the public stance [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3391.1600000000003s)]
*  taken by the US. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3394.48s)]
*  And in a certain sense, they haven't gone far enough, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3395.4s)]
*  but in a certain sense, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3398.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think the granting of refugee status [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3399.7200000000003s)]
*  is much of a solution. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3402.6000000000004s)]
*  Some people will take that up, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3404.56s)]
*  but that's why I told you the story [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3407.2s)]
*  of the Battle of Blood River and the vow. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3408.8s)]
*  We are culturally very, very attached to South Africa. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3410.64s)]
*  And so most of us- [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3415.04s)]
*  I think your family got to South Africa [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3415.88s)]
*  around the time my family got to the United States. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3417.88s)]
*  This is my country. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3419.88s)]
*  I think I'm ninth generation. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3421.52s)]
*  I also have a mother of English descent, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3425.12s)]
*  and I'm also, unlike you, I'm ashamed of it. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3426.92s)]
*  I'm sorry, just kidding. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3429.08s)]
*  Sort of, not really. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3431.52s)]
*  But, you know, of course, I mean, it's your country. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3432.64s)]
*  At that point, what, you know- [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3436.52s)]
*  So I think what a better response from the US could be [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3438.12s)]
*  is to take a firm stance against what is happening [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3443.2799999999997s)]
*  in terms of what the South African government is doing, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3446.44s)]
*  but then to say, how can the US support minority groups [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3448.52s)]
*  in South Africa who are really working [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3453.16s)]
*  for some form of self-determination? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3454.68s)]
*  I think America should recognize [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3456.56s)]
*  that it does have part in the problem [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3459.24s)]
*  in terms of what happened historically. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3463.56s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3465.0s)]
*  Yes, it does, big time. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3465.84s)]
*  Yes, and therefore, it's reasonable, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3467.04s)]
*  and I think it's fair, and I'm hesitant to say this [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3469.6s)]
*  because I'm not an American, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3472.08s)]
*  but I think it's reasonable to say that America [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3473.52s)]
*  has some form of a moral responsibility. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3475.56s)]
*  Not to fix South Africa, but at least to try to rework [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3477.6s)]
*  this mess that has been created [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3482.4s)]
*  because it was involved in creating this mess. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3483.8s)]
*  We've mobilized our State Department [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3486.4s)]
*  to defend, quote, trans rights in the Donbass, okay? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3487.8s)]
*  We've weighed into every sectarian conflict [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3491.16s)]
*  in this world for the past 80 years. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3494.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think we can certainly say [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3497.2000000000003s)]
*  that a minority group targeted for genocide [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3499.08s)]
*  in the country we've been involved in really intimately [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3501.92s)]
*  for my entire life, that that group has a right [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3504.2400000000002s)]
*  not to be killed and to have some measure [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3506.7200000000003s)]
*  of self-determination. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3508.2400000000002s)]
*  I think we can do that. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3509.08s)]
*  Yeah. That's not too big of a deal. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3509.92s)]
*  Absolutely. Right? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3510.76s)]
*  Yeah, and the solution, I would say [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3512.0s)]
*  the most sustainable solution is to help such communities [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3513.6800000000003s)]
*  to govern themselves, to have self-determination. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3516.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's not only, obviously, it would be in our interest, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3519.6s)]
*  but I think it's also in the interest of the West [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3522.4s)]
*  and of America. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3524.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, just on principle, like every other group [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3525.88s)]
*  in the world has the right to its own homeland [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3527.64s)]
*  except white people, like what? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3530.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3532.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, tell me, just explain to me how that makes sense. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3533.0s)]
*  Either no group has a right or every group has a right. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3535.56s)]
*  It's really that simple. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3538.92s)]
*  And if you want to say no group has a right, okay. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3539.76s)]
*  You might even convince me. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3542.04s)]
*  I don't know, I'm not a race guy, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3543.1600000000003s)]
*  actually, by my temperament at all. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3544.4s)]
*  I'd kind of like to ignore it. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3546.36s)]
*  But as long as some groups have a right to self-determination, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3548.0s)]
*  then every group has a right. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3551.0s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3552.2s)]
*  And if there's a special carve out [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3553.44s)]
*  where one group doesn't have a right, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3554.92s)]
*  you have to explain to me [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3556.12s)]
*  why that group doesn't have that right. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3557.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Is that fair? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3558.3199999999997s)]
*  No, it's absolutely fair. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3559.6s)]
*  Well, I think South Africa is a... [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3560.92s)]
*  What? I mean, what the hell is... [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3563.2799999999997s)]
*  Why are we playing along with this nonsense? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3564.24s)]
*  Yeah, this narrative has become this massive stream [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3567.3199999999997s)]
*  that is turned into rapids on a river [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3570.72s)]
*  that just pulls everyone along. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3573.8399999999997s)]
*  And this narrative just says, if you're white, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3575.2799999999997s)]
*  then there's inherently something wrong with you. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3577.24s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3579.0s)]
*  and it's leading toward a really bad conclusion, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3580.44s)]
*  obviously, as it has for... [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3582.92s)]
*  Every other group targeted in this way [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3585.32s)]
*  has really suffered in a bit, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3588.6s)]
*  and there are a lot of them, okay? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3590.04s)]
*  It's not... [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3591.6s)]
*  There are a lot of them. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3592.44s)]
*  Yep. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3593.28s)]
*  And it never ends up well. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3594.12s)]
*  And I just don't know why we're playing along [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3595.8s)]
*  where you're not even allowed to say, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3598.28s)]
*  you haven't been... [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3600.08s)]
*  I don't care anymore, obviously. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3600.92s)]
*  But again, either every group has a right [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3602.76s)]
*  to self-determination or no group does. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3606.36s)]
*  You can't have this system where some groups do, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3608.72s)]
*  or all groups do, but one... [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3612.2799999999997s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3613.7599999999998s)]
*  It's all or nothing on this. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3614.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, I can guarantee... [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3615.7599999999998s)]
*  Tell me how I'm wrong. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3617.44s)]
*  Well, I can guarantee you that when I get back home, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3618.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble for this interview. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3622.68s)]
*  I don't know why, though. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3624.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, what's the counter-argument? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3625.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't really get it. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3627.56s)]
*  What is the counter-argument? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3629.16s)]
*  There's only one group on the entire face of the planet [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3630.68s)]
*  that doesn't have the right that every other group has? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3633.08s)]
*  Tell me how. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3635.2799999999997s)]
*  It's really bizarre. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3636.12s)]
*  Maybe there's a good answer. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3638.96s)]
*  I'm waiting for it. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3639.88s)]
*  No, well, we don't know what the answer is. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3641.0s)]
*  So there is no answer. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3642.64s)]
*  And so because there is no answer, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3643.6s)]
*  the way that uniformity is maintained [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3645.48s)]
*  is just through threats. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3649.08s)]
*  Like, shut up! [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3649.92s)]
*  You're a bad person for saying that. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3651.52s)]
*  You're a Nazi. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3653.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3654.12s)]
*  I hate the Nazis. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3654.94s)]
*  I'm gonna speak for myself. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3655.7799999999997s)]
*  I hate the Nazis. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3656.6s)]
*  I hate the idea that people are attacked [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3657.44s)]
*  for something they can't control, like how they're born. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3659.68s)]
*  They're genetics. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3661.7999999999997s)]
*  I just don't believe in that. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3662.64s)]
*  I never will. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3663.48s)]
*  I'm a Christian. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3664.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't believe in it. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3665.14s)]
*  I'm not gonna do whatever you want. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3666.86s)]
*  I'm actually making the opposite case. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3667.7s)]
*  And I haven't done anything to be ashamed of. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3668.66s)]
*  And if defending the right of people not to be murdered [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3671.42s)]
*  because of how they were born is a crime, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3675.26s)]
*  then I'll plead to it. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3677.66s)]
*  But I actually think that the only thing [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3679.38s)]
*  that people currently in charge of most of the world, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3682.46s)]
*  certainly of the West, are good at [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3684.82s)]
*  is seizing the moral high ground. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3686.1s)]
*  And they don't deserve it. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3688.18s)]
*  They haven't earned it. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3689.06s)]
*  They're rotten. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3690.26s)]
*  Their ideas are rotten. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3691.22s)]
*  And they don't deserve to lecture the rest of us [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3692.34s)]
*  about our moral inferiority [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3694.54s)]
*  while they're endorsing the murder of people [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3696.42s)]
*  for how they were born. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3699.58s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3700.54s)]
*  It's a house of cards. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3701.38s)]
*  What is a house of cards? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3702.2s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3703.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's built and it's a very shining house of cards [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3704.7s)]
*  and it's very proud of its accomplishments, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3708.1s)]
*  but it's not sustainable. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3709.9s)]
*  So South Africa has been a victim of Western imperialism [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3711.82s)]
*  in many ways. I'm aware, yes. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3716.22s)]
*  Ideologically currently, ideological imperialism, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3717.82s)]
*  but also, and this is interesting, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3720.88s)]
*  the ANC that's governing South Africa today [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3723.5s)]
*  was founded just after the unionization [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3725.54s)]
*  of South Africa in 1910. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3728.3s)]
*  And they said that this was one of the major triggers [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3730.3s)]
*  that sparked us to start this movement. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3733.1s)]
*  And the unionization was after the Boer War, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3735.7400000000002s)]
*  before the union, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3738.5s)]
*  South Africa was a variety of different republics [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3739.82s)]
*  and colonies governing themselves. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3743.42s)]
*  And unionization effectively meant [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3745.46s)]
*  that all of these different subsidiary authorities [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3747.3s)]
*  were combined into one big South Africa. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3750.38s)]
*  The borders of South Africa were actually drawn [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3753.74s)]
*  pretty much by the British in 1910. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3756.02s)]
*  And the ANC were vehemently opposed to this. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3758.58s)]
*  They have a long history of border drawing, I notice. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3760.14s)]
*  You see this when you have these completely straight borders [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3762.94s)]
*  and you know that's artificial. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3765.54s)]
*  And so the borders we have for South Africa today [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3767.74s)]
*  was a product of Western imperialism. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3770.94s)]
*  And now those in power would very much like [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3773.9s)]
*  to maintain these borders because they have control. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3776.14s)]
*  And so if we are truly anti-colonialism [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3778.9s)]
*  and anti-imperialist, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3782.4s)]
*  we should return to a position [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3783.88s)]
*  where people govern themselves. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3785.52s)]
*  We should rethink the borders. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3786.6800000000003s)]
*  You'll never be allowed to do that. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3788.4s)]
*  I mean, let's just cut right to the no BS part of this. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3789.6800000000003s)]
*  That will not be allowed. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3793.28s)]
*  It's never been allowed. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3794.48s)]
*  You will need either to get to force, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3796.28s)]
*  which I pray you don't because I hate that. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3798.8s)]
*  I hate killing. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3801.2000000000003s)]
*  Or you will need the assistance [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3803.08s)]
*  of a powerful outside force that makes it happen. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3804.88s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3809.08s)]
*  Is that fair to say? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3809.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think it's fair to say. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3810.88s)]
*  So anyone who says, I want to kill you, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3812.96s)]
*  kill the boar, your subhuman, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3816.7200000000003s)]
*  those are not people who are gonna say, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3819.84s)]
*  yeah, go ahead and create your own independent state [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3821.28s)]
*  and not bother anybody because you're gonna be [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3823.88s)]
*  way more successful and prosperous than they are [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3825.96s)]
*  and they're gonna hate you on the basis of envy, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3828.32s)]
*  of course, that's already happening. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3830.52s)]
*  And we have to ask them nicely [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3832.4s)]
*  to make certain concessions towards us. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3833.88s)]
*  No, I get it's not gonna happen. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3835.6400000000003s)]
*  So what is your plan? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3837.0s)]
*  Well, I think the plan is to firstly, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3839.8s)]
*  to be well-organized communities, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3843.2400000000002s)]
*  to have a very strong sense of community, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3846.2000000000003s)]
*  a sense of pride in who we are, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3847.96s)]
*  to remain Christian and have a strong faith, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3849.6400000000003s)]
*  strong family ties and so forth. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3853.88s)]
*  That's where it starts. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3855.32s)]
*  And then other than that, the second step you might say, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3856.2000000000003s)]
*  the plan is to just create certain realities [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3858.6800000000003s)]
*  on ground level. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3862.28s)]
*  So it's one thing to say, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3863.1200000000003s)]
*  we want more authority or more self-determination, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3864.2400000000002s)]
*  but you have to, in a sense, create that [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3867.44s)]
*  so that what you have created can be recognized. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3870.44s)]
*  There's no point in saying, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3873.56s)]
*  well, you guys can have your own place, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3874.56s)]
*  but that place doesn't exist. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3877.2400000000002s)]
*  So I think what the Afrikaner people need to do [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3879.2400000000002s)]
*  is to a large extent, build their own self-determination. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3881.84s)]
*  And I think that that's what we intend to do, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3885.48s)]
*  but it would help a lot if we can get recognition [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3888.56s)]
*  for this pursuit as a legitimate pursuit. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3890.92s)]
*  So you don't think, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3893.32s)]
*  I sort of just didn't ask you to pause, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3894.68s)]
*  and I should have. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3897.4s)]
*  You began this segment of the conversation [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3898.24s)]
*  by saying the current scheme, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3900.2s)]
*  the current arrangement is not gonna work. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3902.3599999999997s)]
*  Yep. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3903.7999999999997s)]
*  I think most people, certainly I as an outsider, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3906.2s)]
*  instinctively kind of want it to work. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3908.64s)]
*  Well, it's a good story. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3911.04s)]
*  It sounds like a good story. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3912.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a good story, yeah, it is. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3913.64s)]
*  I mean, I'll admit to being kind of a dopey liberal [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3915.0s)]
*  in some ways, I really prefer the idea [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3917.68s)]
*  of people living together in harmony. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3921.48s)]
*  I just feel that way, I can't help it. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3923.2s)]
*  Maybe that's my enlightenment legacy or something. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3924.68s)]
*  I also think you should do with reality, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3930.2799999999997s)]
*  and I definitely don't think you should be allowed [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3931.3599999999997s)]
*  to kill people because of the way they look, period. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3933.12s)]
*  So by the way, how did these people, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3936.2s)]
*  why did they go on TV? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3938.72s)]
*  Like they're on the right side. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3940.0s)]
*  They're like endorsing genocide. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3941.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I don't understand how they've been allowed [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3943.96s)]
*  to get away with being on Winnie Mandela's side [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3946.48s)]
*  and feeling self-righteous. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3949.9199999999996s)]
*  I just don't get that. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3951.04s)]
*  I think it's disgusting. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3951.96s)]
*  Whatever, I said that five times, I can't say it enough. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3953.56s)]
*  But how do you know it won't work? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3955.48s)]
*  Like ANC obviously is a criminal gang, totally incompetent. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3958.84s)]
*  You don't have electricity all the time. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3962.88s)]
*  Like it's not working. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3964.28s)]
*  They're just stealing everything, got it. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3965.12s)]
*  Stealing the copper out of the wires. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3966.8s)]
*  But there's not another political coalition [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3968.88s)]
*  that could run it effectively? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3971.4s)]
*  No. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3972.52s)]
*  So you mentioned electricity. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3973.36s)]
*  In Johannesburg, the mayor just a few days ago [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3975.2000000000003s)]
*  announced that people should just wait seven days [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3977.6400000000003s)]
*  and then they will have water. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3979.84s)]
*  So it's not just an electricity problem. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3982.0800000000004s)]
*  There's a water problem as well. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3983.8s)]
*  There's a water problem. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3984.6400000000003s)]
*  You're gonna have a food problem at some point. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3985.8s)]
*  Well, if the farmers are targeted, yes. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3987.6000000000004s)]
*  So there are many reasons why it's not working [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3990.0s)]
*  and why it won't work. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3993.36s)]
*  And well, everything you can think of [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3995.0s)]
*  points to that direction. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3996.6400000000003s)]
*  One is just the data. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3998.32s)]
*  As I said, like you can look at the levels [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=3999.76s)]
*  of how crime is increasing, how unemployment is increasing, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4001.7200000000003s)]
*  how government service delivery is increasingly failing. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4004.6000000000004s)]
*  Everything, everything. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4006.84s)]
*  Honestly, how health is deteriorating. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4008.88s)]
*  Everything except tax collection. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4012.4s)]
*  That's one aspect of it. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4014.7200000000003s)]
*  Another aspect of it is just the extent [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4016.2400000000002s)]
*  to which people in South Africa [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4018.08s)]
*  are turning their back on politics. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4019.48s)]
*  There's this political vacuum in South Africa [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4022.0s)]
*  and you can see it, for example, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4024.1200000000003s)]
*  with the extent to which people have stopped voting, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4025.92s)]
*  how voter turnout has dropped significantly in elections. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4028.6000000000004s)]
*  People just don't interest it. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4032.96s)]
*  They vote reluctantly, those who do. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4034.88s)]
*  So that's one aspect of it. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4037.32s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4038.48s)]
*  Why do you think that? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4040.32s)]
*  Because they feel hopeless? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4041.16s)]
*  Because they feel the political establishment [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4042.36s)]
*  is completely disconnected. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4044.7200000000003s)]
*  They don't, it doesn't resonate with them. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4046.2000000000003s)]
*  They don't, people vote for parties [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4049.36s)]
*  even though they don't really like them. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4050.96s)]
*  But they think this is, of all the parties, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4053.0s)]
*  I don't like any of them, but this one is the least bad, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4054.56s)]
*  so I'll vote for that one. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4057.56s)]
*  So there's a complete disconnect between the politicians [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4058.92s)]
*  or the political elite in South Africa, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4061.4s)]
*  even the opposition parties and the people. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4063.2400000000002s)]
*  And so there's this political vacuum [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4066.36s)]
*  that has developed and this vacuum is filled, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4068.04s)]
*  as my friend, Aaron Stoncel, in South Africa says, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4070.68s)]
*  either by the good guys or the bad guys. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4073.4s)]
*  It's filled by the bad guys in terms of organized crime. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4075.72s)]
*  So we have these mafias and gangs coming to the fore [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4078.52s)]
*  with significant power, to such an extent [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4081.52s)]
*  that the government is afraid of them. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4084.0s)]
*  Or it can be filled. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4085.7599999999998s)]
*  Boy, that is the story globally, isn't it? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4086.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, yeah, I think it is. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4088.32s)]
*  The drug cartels are one of the most powerful governments [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4090.12s)]
*  in the world and they're not even in government. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4092.2799999999997s)]
*  It's incredible, yeah. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4093.7599999999998s)]
*  So we have a construction mafia, for example. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4094.6s)]
*  If you build a shopping center, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4097.04s)]
*  the construction mafia turns up and they tell you, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4098.88s)]
*  you need to employ our people or else we're gonna sabotage [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4101.320000000001s)]
*  your building and stuff like that. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4104.0s)]
*  And it's a regular thing. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4105.4400000000005s)]
*  And you can't fight them. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4107.64s)]
*  No, you can't, you can't fight them. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4108.56s)]
*  But the vacuum can be filled by the good guys [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4111.4800000000005s)]
*  and that's well-organized communities [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4113.400000000001s)]
*  who take control of what is important to them. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4115.400000000001s)]
*  And so the future is very, and that's what analysts [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4118.08s)]
*  and scenario analysts and so forth have been saying, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4121.12s)]
*  that the future is one of deterioration, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4124.88s)]
*  where you will have communities who will be much worse off [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4127.400000000001s)]
*  than they are today because of the bad guys [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4131.52s)]
*  filling the void. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4134.0s)]
*  And you might have flourishing communities [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4135.12s)]
*  because of good guys filling the void. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4137.12s)]
*  And so that's another reason, but I think the most important [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4139.96s)]
*  fundamental underlying reason why it's not sustainable [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4142.64s)]
*  is it's a political system that is detached [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4145.6s)]
*  from the reality in South Africa. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4148.52s)]
*  The reality is the distance from Cape Town, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4149.88s)]
*  the South to the North of South Africa [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4152.400000000001s)]
*  is the distance from Rome to London. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4154.2s)]
*  So it's a big country, number one, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4156.08s)]
*  but it's not homogenous by any means. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4159.36s)]
*  It's very diverse. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4161.5599999999995s)]
*  There's 11 official languages in South Africa. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4162.88s)]
*  Just to restate, it's not just black and white at all. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4165.32s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, it's certainly not. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4167.679999999999s)]
*  There's this Indian community, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4169.0s)]
*  there's what we call colored community in South Africa. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4170.08s)]
*  And there are various different tribes, you could say, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4173.08s)]
*  or cultural communities among black South Africans [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4175.76s)]
*  and among white South Africans. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4179.08s)]
*  So it's very diverse, different languages, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4180.679999999999s)]
*  different cultures. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4182.96s)]
*  And now we have this political system [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4186.0s)]
*  that just says you have individual rights. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4187.52s)]
*  And in some ways, the constitution, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4189.76s)]
*  even though it was very much celebrated when it was adopted, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4192.08s)]
*  it was called the best constitution in the world [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4194.88s)]
*  and the most liberal, most democratic and so forth. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4197.24s)]
*  The constitution says- [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4199.92s)]
*  It guarantees everything, but you get nothing. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4200.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, that's exactly it. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4202.4s)]
*  So we have what they call third generation rights, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4203.52s)]
*  first, second and third. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4205.64s)]
*  It's a very vast network of rights that you have in theory. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4206.72s)]
*  But then the question is, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4211.76s)]
*  so there's this idea that the highest authority [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4213.32s)]
*  is the constitution, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4215.92s)]
*  but it's not possible for a written document [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4217.44s)]
*  to have the highest authority. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4220.08s)]
*  The highest authority is with the person [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4221.32s)]
*  who gets to interpret it. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4222.88s)]
*  So- [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4224.44s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, boy, is that true. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4225.28s)]
*  So for example, section 25 of the constitution [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4228.0s)]
*  in South Africa, which the government is trying to change, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4231.24s)]
*  it's a private property rights clause. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4233.2s)]
*  They want to change it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4235.2s)]
*  But currently it says the government [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4236.52s)]
*  can expropriate your property [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4238.04s)]
*  if it's in the public interest. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4240.24s)]
*  Now, if you ask me as a Westerner, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4242.08s)]
*  when is it in public interest to expropriate property? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4243.72s)]
*  It would be something like they have to build a big highway [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4246.84s)]
*  or maybe there's a military emergency [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4249.4s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4251.48s)]
*  If you ask a judge who is founded in this ideology [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4252.599999999999s)]
*  we've just spoken of, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4256.599999999999s)]
*  they would say it's in the public interest [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4258.0s)]
*  for white people not to own land. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4259.32s)]
*  So it's a question of interpretation. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4261.2s)]
*  You can have a wonderful document, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4263.4s)]
*  but it boils down to how do you interpret it? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4264.679999999999s)]
*  And so, and that's why I'm saying [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4267.48s)]
*  it's not compatible with realities on ground level. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4268.84s)]
*  And you know, we can, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4271.64s)]
*  and there's been many law fair in South Africa, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4273.400000000001s)]
*  many, many, many. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4275.64s)]
*  South Africa is a very good example of political court cases [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4276.4800000000005s)]
*  and we've won many and we've lost many, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4279.08s)]
*  but it's a ship that is sinking. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4281.360000000001s)]
*  That's the fact. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4285.96s)]
*  Well, and it all seems fake. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4286.8s)]
*  I mean, it seems like, and I, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4287.72s)]
*  again, one of the reasons I'm so fascinated [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4289.84s)]
*  by your country is I think it's on a trajectory [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4291.28s)]
*  that I recognize as an American. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4296.16s)]
*  So you have these legacy institutions [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4299.360000000001s)]
*  that sort of go through the kabuki of dispensing justice, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4300.8s)]
*  but it's not justice actually. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4303.52s)]
*  It's totally disconnected from justice. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4304.52s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4305.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4306.72s)]
*  And you have this constitution, which is beautiful, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4307.56s)]
*  which is, you know, ignored. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4310.04s)]
*  The only power resides in the people who interpret it, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4312.400000000001s)]
*  as you said. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4315.120000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4315.96s)]
*  And so then you reach kind of the end point [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4317.120000000001s)]
*  or the most recent end point, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4319.72s)]
*  which is the idea that whites can't own land. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4320.76s)]
*  Can you explain this? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4322.84s)]
*  Yes, so they have been trying to change [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4324.0s)]
*  the South African constitution, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4326.04s)]
*  the property rights clause, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4327.36s)]
*  to empower the government to expropriate private property [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4328.16s)]
*  without compensation. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4331.0s)]
*  That's the buzzword. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4332.16s)]
*  Just steal the land. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4333.36s)]
*  Yeah, they call it EWC, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4334.5199999999995s)]
*  it's expropriation without compensation, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4336.599999999999s)]
*  but it's confiscation of property. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4338.04s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4339.4s)]
*  Well, how is expropriation without compensation [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4340.24s)]
*  different from stealing? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4342.04s)]
*  No, exactly. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4343.12s)]
*  But- [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4344.28s)]
*  It's just shoplifting. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4345.12s)]
*  I mean, what? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4346.08s)]
*  It's just, it's flabbergasting to see the extent [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4346.92s)]
*  to which, again, academics and analysts and journalists [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4350.28s)]
*  are rushing to the defense of the South African government. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4353.84s)]
*  In South Africa, there? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4356.24s)]
*  Yes, one of the many bizarre things that they would say. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4357.84s)]
*  They would say, this is all a lie, you guys are lying. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4360.36s)]
*  It's not expropriation without compensation. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4362.88s)]
*  It's expropriation with compensation, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4365.76s)]
*  but compensation can be null. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4367.92s)]
*  So it can be zero compensation. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4370.2s)]
*  So it's not happening, but it's a good thing that it is. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4371.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4374.24s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4375.08s)]
*  As always, right. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4375.92s)]
*  And so the president has just signed [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4376.76s)]
*  the expropriation bill in South Africa, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4378.8s)]
*  which is now- [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4380.5199999999995s)]
*  Which they now- [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4381.64s)]
*  He signed it. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4382.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4383.44s)]
*  So, and so there's still an attempt [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4384.36s)]
*  to change the constitution, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4387.36s)]
*  and there's now a new bill in process. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4388.24s)]
*  It was just announced, I think, a week ago [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4391.88s)]
*  that they want to pass through parliament [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4393.48s)]
*  that says that 80% of, that's what it boils down to, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4395.28s)]
*  that 80% of land or property in South Africa [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4398.48s)]
*  must be owned by black people. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4400.599999999999s)]
*  So, because it says it must be racially representative. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4402.679999999999s)]
*  And so I want to tell you a quick story about this [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4406.0s)]
*  because it sort of highlights the ideology. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4408.4s)]
*  I was at a land summit in South Africa, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4410.5599999999995s)]
*  and a spokesperson for the Department of Land Reform spoke. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4413.56s)]
*  And it was very clear from his speech [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4418.160000000001s)]
*  that the problem is white people owning land. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4419.84s)]
*  It was a racial thing, it was very clear. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4422.360000000001s)]
*  But it's colored with words like restitution [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4424.160000000001s)]
*  and correcting historic injustices and so forth. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4427.8s)]
*  And so I asked him at this summit, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4431.200000000001s)]
*  I said, so here's an example. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4432.52s)]
*  And what would the government's position be on this? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4434.76s)]
*  The example is a white guy owns a farm, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4437.52s)]
*  the government takes it from him [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4440.76s)]
*  to correct historic injustices, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4442.24s)]
*  and they give it to a black guy. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4444.639999999999s)]
*  And it's a black farmer. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4446.2s)]
*  And maybe a year or two down the line, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4448.0s)]
*  this black farmer decides he doesn't want [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4449.719999999999s)]
*  to be a farmer anymore, he wants to sell his land. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4451.48s)]
*  And the buyer is white. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4454.24s)]
*  And now there's a white farmer again. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4455.8s)]
*  What's the government's position on this? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4457.719999999999s)]
*  And the spokesperson for the department says, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4459.639999999999s)]
*  in that case, the correction of the injustice [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4461.679999999999s)]
*  has been reversed. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4464.96s)]
*  It's completely bizarre. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4468.76s)]
*  What's interesting is we've seen this exact movie [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4471.240000000001s)]
*  frame by frame right next door in Zimbabwe, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4474.280000000001s)]
*  formerly Rhodesia, which was one of the most [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4477.8s)]
*  prosperous countries in Africa, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4480.320000000001s)]
*  one of the big tobacco producers in Africa. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4481.8s)]
*  It's very sad what happened to that country. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4484.400000000001s)]
*  Well, it's shocking. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4486.04s)]
*  But it's again, it's like organized government sponsored [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4487.0s)]
*  racism doesn't work. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4489.88s)]
*  And I don't care how often the New York Times defends it, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4490.84s)]
*  it's always the same. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4494.68s)]
*  And that is like right next door to you. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4496.4s)]
*  And you have a refugee crisis in your country [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4500.679999999999s)]
*  because of it. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4502.759999999999s)]
*  And- [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4503.599999999999s)]
*  Well, our government, our ruling party- [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4504.719999999999s)]
*  So what do they say to that? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4506.2s)]
*  No, they say that Robert Mugabe is a hero [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4507.16s)]
*  and that Zanu P.F. the party- [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4509.799999999999s)]
*  His party, yeah. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4511.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, is a good party and it's a liberation force [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4512.799999999999s)]
*  and we respect them. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4515.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, so again, no one wants to use the term, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4516.5199999999995s)]
*  but this is genocide. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4520.36s)]
*  I mean, that's what that is. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4522.48s)]
*  It's like targeting a group of people for extinction, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4523.32s)]
*  elimination on the basis of immutable characteristics. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4526.08s)]
*  Like I don't know what, is there another genocide definition [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4529.28s)]
*  I'm not aware of? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4532.36s)]
*  Well, I think you can say there are threats [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4533.68s)]
*  of that happening. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4536.96s)]
*  There's not a genocide happening in South Africa. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4537.88s)]
*  No, I'm not saying there is. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4539.72s)]
*  I'm saying that's where it's going. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4540.5599999999995s)]
*  Like what's the other end point here? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4542.0s)]
*  Well, yes. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4544.36s)]
*  You're not human, you can't own land, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4545.24s)]
*  you should be killed. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4546.72s)]
*  What am I missing? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4548.6s)]
*  Yes, and yeah, if you own land by definition, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4549.44s)]
*  that's illegitimate, regardless of whether you bought [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4551.5199999999995s)]
*  the land, it doesn't matter how you got the land. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4553.64s)]
*  Because of your race. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4555.68s)]
*  Because of your race, yes. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4556.6s)]
*  If we can't say that's wrong, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4557.8s)]
*  then anyone who can't say that's wrong, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4560.160000000001s)]
*  anyone who makes excuses for that is a dangerous person. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4562.76s)]
*  I don't know what else to say. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4565.160000000001s)]
*  Put another group in there. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4567.200000000001s)]
*  I don't care what group it is. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4568.240000000001s)]
*  So the ANC in South Africa wanted to, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4570.0s)]
*  they have this process of name changes. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4572.040000000001s)]
*  And by the way, this targeting of statues [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4574.240000000001s)]
*  came from South Africa. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4576.120000000001s)]
*  It's happening in America. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4576.96s)]
*  It started in South Africa, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4577.96s)]
*  burning down statues and so forth. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4579.160000000001s)]
*  So, and they've had this long process of name changes. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4581.160000000001s)]
*  And one thing they wanted to change the street [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4584.08s)]
*  in which the US embassy is in South Africa, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4587.4800000000005s)]
*  to Fiddle Castro Avenue. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4589.8s)]
*  That's one story. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4592.0s)]
*  The other one is they wanted to change [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4592.92s)]
*  one of the main streets in Pretoria [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4594.4800000000005s)]
*  to name it after Mao Tse Tung. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4595.92s)]
*  And then some of the opposition parties said, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4598.28s)]
*  are you crazy? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4599.8s)]
*  Do you know what Mao Tse Tung did? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4600.8s)]
*  And the response was, remember, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4602.72s)]
*  Mao was never convicted of any crime. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4604.32s)]
*  So. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4606.64s)]
*  So. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4607.4800000000005s)]
*  It's, I say, it does seem not only like [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4608.32s)]
*  one of the worst governments in the world, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4612.56s)]
*  but one of the dumbest also. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4613.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4615.200000000001s)]
*  Well, so I think, I think there's part, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4617.240000000001s)]
*  there's some explanation as to why [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4619.92s)]
*  the South African government has gone so off the rails. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4622.04s)]
*  And it's that they've gotten a free pass for decades. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4623.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4626.84s)]
*  Because of this narrative. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4627.68s)]
*  They could do and say whatever they want. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4628.52s)]
*  They got no criticism or very little criticism. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4630.240000000001s)]
*  I know. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4632.8s)]
*  Or very careful criticism. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4633.64s)]
*  And that's why I think they've gone so ballistic [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4634.92s)]
*  of the recent comments by Trump [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4637.68s)]
*  and people like Elon Musk and so. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4640.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, have they? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4641.92s)]
*  I'm sorry, I don't follow it that closely. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4642.8s)]
*  Have they, those comments were noticed in South Africa? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4644.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, absolutely. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4646.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's the biggest story in South Africa at the moment. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4647.56s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4650.320000000001s)]
*  And what are they saying? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4651.16s)]
*  Well, they're saying that we've, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4652.320000000001s)]
*  the organizations that I was involved with [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4654.6s)]
*  at the time have committed treason, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4656.280000000001s)]
*  that we've been charged for treason. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4657.64s)]
*  You've been charged with treason? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4659.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4660.360000000001s)]
*  For what? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4661.2s)]
*  For speaking, well, among others, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4662.04s)]
*  for me speaking with you about what's happening. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4663.52s)]
*  That's treason? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4665.6s)]
*  Yeah, because it's bad mouthing your country. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4666.4400000000005s)]
*  That's the argument. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4669.0s)]
*  Damn. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4670.24s)]
*  I don't know if it was this, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4671.12s)]
*  one of the opposition parties who filed the charges. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4673.5599999999995s)]
*  I wanted to go to Cape Town for Christmas just on vacation. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4675.4s)]
*  I didn't have time in the end, but. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4677.44s)]
*  You'll have to put on shades. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4679.5599999999995s)]
*  Probably shouldn't go, is that what you're saying? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4681.04s)]
*  No, no, you should come to South Africa. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4682.88s)]
*  No, you should definitely come. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4684.6s)]
*  Funny. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4685.92s)]
*  I don't know if there's gonna, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4687.44s)]
*  much will come from the treason charges, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4688.36s)]
*  but that's certainly the action. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4690.28s)]
*  But you've been charged with treason? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4691.92s)]
*  Yeah, there were official complaints filed at the police. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4693.44s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4696.48s)]
*  What's the penalty for treason in South Africa? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4697.92s)]
*  It would be imprisonment. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4700.28s)]
*  We don't have the death penalty. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4701.12s)]
*  No, they just, it's necklace you. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4703.48s)]
*  It's informal. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4706.04s)]
*  Well, I'm honestly, seriously, I'm more concerned [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4707.32s)]
*  if the question's about safety, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4709.92s)]
*  about mob justice in South Africa, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4712.08s)]
*  than the actual government coming after you. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4714.5599999999995s)]
*  Of course. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4717.04s)]
*  So what does that look like? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4717.88s)]
*  Well, we have, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4719.84s)]
*  we, I think you reported on this in 2021, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4722.639999999999s)]
*  I think when there was this massive riots in South Africa, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4726.0s)]
*  when they just- [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4729.64s)]
*  In Durban. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4730.4800000000005s)]
*  In Durban, and then it- [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4731.320000000001s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4732.16s)]
*  Yeah, it sort of spilled out to Gauteng, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4733.0s)]
*  to Johannesburg, to a lesser extent. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4734.8s)]
*  And it's just people, it's almost like, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4737.4800000000005s)]
*  smelling blood and becoming extremely violent, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4739.88s)]
*  and so forth, and then people join in by the thousands. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4742.240000000001s)]
*  I've seen that with my own eyes a couple of times. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4744.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's- [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4747.400000000001s)]
*  It's really scary. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4748.240000000001s)]
*  So someone, a friend from Europe once asked me, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4749.360000000001s)]
*  are you not afraid that the government's gonna come [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4751.16s)]
*  to your house and take your stuff? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4753.88s)]
*  And my honest answer is not that much. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4755.320000000001s)]
*  I'm more concerned about a mob showing up. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4758.2s)]
*  So then what do you do? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4760.92s)]
*  Well, if you are alone, you can't do anything. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4763.0s)]
*  If you're a well-functioning, well-organized community, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4765.68s)]
*  then the community, you can call people on the radio, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4768.0s)]
*  you can get the community to take a stance. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4770.24s)]
*  And I think that's one of the- [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4773.92s)]
*  So you don't get lynched. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4775.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4776.36s)]
*  You got a lot of lynchings and stuff. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4777.2s)]
*  I mean, that's, again, add it to the irony file. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4778.4s)]
*  I mean, South Africa's like the world capital of lynching. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4781.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4784.12s)]
*  Oh, I noticed, yeah. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4784.96s)]
*  It's not so much white people who are targeted- [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4786.08s)]
*  I'm aware, no, blacks. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4788.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that certainly. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4789.96s)]
*  It has happened in the previous dispensation. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4791.72s)]
*  It's still happening to an extent, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4794.04s)]
*  not as much as in the past, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4796.08s)]
*  but people don't know that it's still happening. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4797.28s)]
*  To people accused of crimes and- [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4799.84s)]
*  Yeah, and it's partly due to the fact [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4801.2s)]
*  that the police is absent. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4802.88s)]
*  So especially in townships, someone is a rapist [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4804.36s)]
*  and the police doesn't show up, doesn't do anything, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4807.64s)]
*  and then the local community just deals with him. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4809.88s)]
*  That type of thing happens in South Africa. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4813.4s)]
*  In a very brutal way. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4814.8s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4816.8s)]
*  Yeah, it does happen in a brutal way. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4818.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4820.2s)]
*  I've noticed. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4822.92s)]
*  Pretty shocking, almost like I wouldn't want to describe it. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4824.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mentioned the necklace murders before, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4826.2s)]
*  so we have that. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4828.6s)]
*  And it's the same with the xenophobic violence. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4829.56s)]
*  It's very unfortunate. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4831.360000000001s)]
*  And if we had a well-functioning police service, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4833.52s)]
*  maybe that would have helped, but we don't. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4836.4800000000005s)]
*  So in South Africa, we can check the numbers. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4838.8s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the private security sphere in South Africa [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4842.360000000001s)]
*  is almost as big as private security in America, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4845.2s)]
*  but America is much larger. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4848.4s)]
*  Private security in South Africa is more than double [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4850.16s)]
*  the police and the army combined. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4853.88s)]
*  If you add the police and the army up together [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4856.12s)]
*  and you multiply it by two, private security is, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4858.24s)]
*  the amount of private security officers in South Africa [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4861.36s)]
*  or security guards is- [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4863.599999999999s)]
*  Do you have the right of self-defense, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4865.32s)]
*  the right to defend yourself and your family in South Africa? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4867.08s)]
*  Yes, we do have the right to self-defense. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4869.679999999999s)]
*  We can own firearms, although it's not as easy [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4870.8s)]
*  as in America, but you can do that. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4872.92s)]
*  And you can get arms, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4876.08s)]
*  especially through a private security company, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4877.0s)]
*  you can, there's some room to make sure [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4878.76s)]
*  that you can protect yourself. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4881.12s)]
*  And does it work? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4882.8s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4884.52s)]
*  In terms of the farm murders, we've seen that statistically [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4885.76s)]
*  that in communities where areas or communities [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4888.68s)]
*  where people are well-organized, where they have radios, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4892.6s)]
*  where they drive patrols, where they are trained, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4894.64s)]
*  there's a decrease in farm murders. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4897.12s)]
*  You can clearly see that. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4899.0s)]
*  Actually in the last few years, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4900.24s)]
*  the farm murder numbers have come down a bit [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4901.92s)]
*  and it's not because the incitement has gotten better. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4905.4s)]
*  It's not because the police is more efficient. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4909.96s)]
*  It's because local communities have become much more involved [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4912.48s)]
*  with their own safety. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4916.04s)]
*  And so that's certainly one of the most important [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4917.84s)]
*  building blocks of this. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4920.44s)]
*  So what, now that the president, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4921.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm using air quotes again around president, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4924.0s)]
*  I mean, the whole system is fake, obviously. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4925.639999999999s)]
*  It doesn't affect justice. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4927.599999999999s)]
*  It doesn't improve the lives of its citizens. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4928.52s)]
*  It's in no sense a legitimate government. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4931.160000000001s)]
*  And by the way, it's not the only [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4933.6s)]
*  illegitimate government in the world. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4934.64s)]
*  But anyway, what happens when they try, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4937.040000000001s)]
*  the government tries to put this law into effect [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4942.4800000000005s)]
*  to try and act on it? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4945.88s)]
*  The government shows up at your house as you can't, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4947.120000000001s)]
*  you've lived in the same plot for a hundred years, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4950.040000000001s)]
*  you can't have it because you're white, we're taking it. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4951.92s)]
*  Like what, do people comply? [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4953.52s)]
*  No, no, people won't comply. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4955.96s)]
*  That's partly why I told this story at the beginning [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4959.24s)]
*  is the Afrikaner people and the farmers are very stubborn. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4961.2s)]
*  This in Afrikaans, we say hard-headed. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4964.839999999999s)]
*  So this idea- [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4968.2s)]
*  Well, farmers, you have to be stubborn [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4969.2s)]
*  to be a farmer in the first place. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4970.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes, and especially a farmer in South Africa. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4971.839999999999s)]
*  Why aren't you in private equity? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4973.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's easier. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4974.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4975.599999999999s)]
*  So it's a common trope among farmers to say [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4976.879999999999s)]
*  that I would rather die on my farm [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4979.839999999999s)]
*  than to hand it over to the government. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4981.679999999999s)]
*  And so I think if they really try to act on it, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4984.16s)]
*  which they haven't tried, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4987.84s)]
*  there are land invasions in South Africa, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4989.04s)]
*  but it's not so much the government, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4990.68s)]
*  it's mobs and gangs and so forth, invading people's land. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4992.08s)]
*  But if they really try to act on these attempts [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4995.52s)]
*  at expropriation, there's going to be a massive backlash. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=4997.92s)]
*  And there's no doubt. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5000.76s)]
*  So what they would say is, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5002.56s)]
*  this is actually what the government says, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5004.200000000001s)]
*  that we need to do what happened in Zimbabwe [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5006.400000000001s)]
*  but without violence. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5010.88s)]
*  But that's how they would argue it. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5013.68s)]
*  They actually say we need to do what happened in Zimbabwe? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5015.64s)]
*  But this time without violence. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5018.240000000001s)]
*  That's one of the worst crimes of my lifetime. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5019.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, they say it publicly. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5020.88s)]
*  You can find it online. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5022.400000000001s)]
*  And so the argument is, but we're going to do it a bit better. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5023.68s)]
*  We're going to do it without violence. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5027.64s)]
*  But what that means is we're going to do [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5028.88s)]
*  what happened in Zimbabwe [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5031.64s)]
*  and you are not going to resist. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5032.88s)]
*  That's what it means. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5034.64s)]
*  But obviously people will resist when they try to do that. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5035.52s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5038.72s)]
*  But I do think the government is very incompetent. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5040.88s)]
*  They have these very radical ideas. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5043.200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if there's a competency [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5045.8s)]
*  to actually go through with these ideas. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5048.24s)]
*  That's the upside. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5049.76s)]
*  I lived in Washington DC almost my whole life. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5050.6s)]
*  And that was absolutely true there. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5053.280000000001s)]
*  The government make all these, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5055.52s)]
*  local government make all these threatening noises, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5056.4800000000005s)]
*  do this, do that, do the other thing. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5058.2s)]
*  It's against the law to do this, whatever. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5060.16s)]
*  And you just kind of ignore, people just ignored it. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5061.84s)]
*  And- [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5063.84s)]
*  So there are some business organizations in South Africa [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5065.2s)]
*  who now use the term maximum appropriate non-compliance. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5068.08s)]
*  That's what they encourage private companies to do. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5072.96s)]
*  So it's a form of civil disobedience. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5075.8s)]
*  It's with all these BEE, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5077.68s)]
*  that's these black empowerment laws. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5079.2s)]
*  Just say, we're just not going to comply. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5081.04s)]
*  I know someone who had a thriving business [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5083.12s)]
*  he built himself in South Africa. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5085.4s)]
*  And the government showed up and said, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5087.72s)]
*  you're handing half your business to your new partner [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5088.72s)]
*  who didn't do any of it, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5091.68s)]
*  just show up and collect the money. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5092.52s)]
*  And it's just, they stole half his business. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5093.88s)]
*  Because it's all theft. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5096.12s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5096.96s)]
*  I noticed that black South Africans haven't gotten richer [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5097.8s)]
*  in the last 30 years. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5100.12s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5100.96s)]
*  And the government owns the land. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5101.8s)]
*  They own the land of the land that they expropriate. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5103.320000000001s)]
*  They don't give it to people. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5104.160000000001s)]
*  It goes to the government. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5105.0s)]
*  So what if you were to say, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5106.0s)]
*  like, how about no? [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5108.160000000001s)]
*  Like you have no legitimacy [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5109.52s)]
*  and you haven't been here any longer than I've been here. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5111.56s)]
*  And you have, I mean, and I have guns too. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5114.4800000000005s)]
*  So like, I'm not participating. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5117.240000000001s)]
*  How's that? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5118.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5119.160000000001s)]
*  Well, civil disobedience can be a wonderful thing. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5120.0s)]
*  And we've had some examples [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5121.6s)]
*  of successful civil disobedience campaigns in South Africa [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5122.88s)]
*  where the government had these, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5125.64s)]
*  they call it the E-TOL system. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5127.12s)]
*  It's like a big tax system on the highways [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5128.4400000000005s)]
*  it's an electronic tax system. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5131.76s)]
*  But people just buy the thousands, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5134.4800000000005s)]
*  tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5136.4800000000005s)]
*  just refuse to comply to get the tags and so forth. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5138.2s)]
*  And eventually they had to stop it [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5141.72s)]
*  because even though it was law, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5142.84s)]
*  people just didn't do it. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5145.0s)]
*  And the same with COVID. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5146.24s)]
*  COVID was a good example. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5147.28s)]
*  I love that. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5148.4800000000005s)]
*  We've had a bizarre COVID. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5149.32s)]
*  Everyone has had a bizarre COVID. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5151.12s)]
*  So we had these strange laws [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5152.36s)]
*  like you can't buy flip-flops during COVID. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5153.88s)]
*  But those are deadly. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5156.56s)]
*  Yeah, and you cannot buy shorts. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5157.4s)]
*  And stuff you cannot buy cooked chicken. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5160.12s)]
*  We had these really, really bizarre COVID laws. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5161.96s)]
*  It's a crime to buy cooked chicken [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5165.5199999999995s)]
*  or to sell cooked chicken during COVID. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5166.96s)]
*  And so people just said, well, we don't care. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5169.28s)]
*  We're just gonna do what we want. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5173.12s)]
*  And so there was a massive civil disobedience phenomenon [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5175.28s)]
*  in South Africa during the COVID lockdown. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5180.16s)]
*  And so I think people have learned [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5182.599999999999s)]
*  and the government couldn't do anything about it. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5183.84s)]
*  I think people have learned that [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5185.68s)]
*  that you can actually do a lot [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5187.8s)]
*  if you just don't comply [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5190.04s)]
*  with these completely ridiculous, irrational laws. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5191.48s)]
*  That sounds, I mean, I'm still living in South Africa, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5195.84s)]
*  but again, I have lived in Washington, DC. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5198.08s)]
*  So that sounds totally right to me. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5199.84s)]
*  I wonder though about what you said [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5203.16s)]
*  when we first started talking about this [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5204.8s)]
*  about the mob justice. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5207.04s)]
*  That does sound scary to me. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5210.04s)]
*  I think that's a bigger threat. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5212.44s)]
*  What do you do about that? [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5214.12s)]
*  How do you live in a country where, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5216.44s)]
*  like your neighbors could rise up against you? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5218.2s)]
*  Yeah, so we've had some examples of this. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5220.919999999999s)]
*  It started with the roads must fall movement. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5224.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, the roads, oh, sizzle roads. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5229.08s)]
*  Sizzle John roads. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5230.16s)]
*  So this one guy defecated on Sizzle John roads, a statue. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5231.0s)]
*  Was it UCT? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5235.719999999999s)]
*  What university was it in Cape Town? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5236.639999999999s)]
*  And then they started this movement. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5239.799999999999s)]
*  He defecated on it. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5241.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5242.2s)]
*  That's attractive. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5243.2s)]
*  Well, that's kind of like the level actually [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5244.04s)]
*  that you're dealing with. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5248.0s)]
*  And so they started this movement of tearing down statues, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5249.24s)]
*  which eventually boiled over to America. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5253.88s)]
*  And that's how it got to America. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5255.72s)]
*  It started in, and it boiled over to Europe and so forth. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5257.0s)]
*  But it started with that, this targeting of statues. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5261.0s)]
*  I think it was 2012 or something. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5263.92s)]
*  It was maybe before that even. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5265.84s)]
*  And it became a mob. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5268.28s)]
*  And they wore T-shirts with slogans like, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5270.12s)]
*  kill the whites, like on the T-shirt. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5273.08s)]
*  And it became very violent and very overtly racist. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5275.48s)]
*  And it was students running around just setting things [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5279.6s)]
*  on fire, burning down buildings and stuff like that. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5283.72s)]
*  So that is a real threat. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5286.68s)]
*  And then later we had the fees must fall movement. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5288.48s)]
*  That was university students demanding [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5290.76s)]
*  that education must be free. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5292.44s)]
*  You shouldn't pay to go to university. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5295.24s)]
*  And it was the same thing. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5297.24s)]
*  And now we've had these, more recently, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5298.84s)]
*  we've had political parties sort of taken up that thing. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5301.2s)]
*  They've killed the Boer and so forth. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5303.679999999999s)]
*  And so I honestly think in South Africa, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5306.04s)]
*  the threat of mob violence is a bigger threat [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5308.599999999999s)]
*  than the government. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5311.16s)]
*  Of course it is. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5312.0s)]
*  Of course it is. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5313.32s)]
*  And that's where you get killed, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5314.44s)]
*  in situations like that, I think. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5317.08s)]
*  So what do you, I mean, you have to be pretty well organized, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5319.88s)]
*  pretty well armed. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5323.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, the thing is there's no silver bullet. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5325.08s)]
*  There's no one thing that we can do to make sure [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5327.5199999999995s)]
*  that we're equipped to withstand that. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5329.96s)]
*  But if there is a silver bullet, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5332.96s)]
*  it would be, or the closest to it, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5335.12s)]
*  it would be what I mentioned earlier, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5337.76s)]
*  is well organized communities. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5339.0s)]
*  Communities that have a sense of community, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5341.2s)]
*  that recognize that you have a sense of responsibility, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5344.2s)]
*  not just towards yourself and your own family, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5347.2s)]
*  but towards your community. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5349.08s)]
*  And that you have some form of a communal identity [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5350.8s)]
*  that is under threat, that is being targeted. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5354.0s)]
*  And you have to protect yourself. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5356.12s)]
*  You have to fulfill a bunch of functions [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5357.4s)]
*  that the government is not fulfilling. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5359.44s)]
*  Even though you're paying them to do it, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5361.4s)]
*  they're not doing it. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5362.759999999999s)]
*  So you have to look after your own safety. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5363.879999999999s)]
*  You need to have a gun. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5365.679999999999s)]
*  You need to have a bulletproof vest. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5366.5599999999995s)]
*  You need to have, or if you don't, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5368.759999999999s)]
*  then at least a significant amount of people [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5370.5599999999995s)]
*  in your community must, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5372.32s)]
*  especially those who are more interested [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5373.96s)]
*  in this type of thing. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5375.32s)]
*  You need to be well organized. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5376.719999999999s)]
*  You need to be prepared if something bad happens [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5377.96s)]
*  in your community, if the mob comes, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5381.32s)]
*  if they set the shopping mall on fire, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5382.839999999999s)]
*  or if they come for people's houses, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5384.919999999999s)]
*  that in a very short timeframe, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5387.0s)]
*  you can get a whole bunch of people mobilized [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5390.48s)]
*  to protect their community. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5393.28s)]
*  And with these riots in 2021, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5394.8s)]
*  that was a good case study, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5397.24s)]
*  because some communities were completely unprepared [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5398.36s)]
*  and they were virtually destroyed. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5400.68s)]
*  And some communities were very well prepared. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5402.2s)]
*  And when the mobs arrived, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5404.4s)]
*  there was a bunch of people with guns waiting for them. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5405.6s)]
*  And- [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5408.08s)]
*  Well, I saw a video of the South Asian communities [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5408.92s)]
*  in Durban. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5411.44s)]
*  The big South Asian, big Indian community there. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5412.28s)]
*  And I don't know if this is represented, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5414.8s)]
*  but the videos I saw, man, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5417.4800000000005s)]
*  they were not putting up with it at all. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5418.64s)]
*  Yeah, they were very well-armed. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5420.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5421.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5422.52s)]
*  It's like some heroic Indians out there. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5423.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there was one, I think, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5426.04s)]
*  some guy with something that looked like a mini gun [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5427.12s)]
*  on the back of a pickup truck. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5429.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know where they got that, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5431.8s)]
*  but that's an example. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5433.0s)]
*  It was another example. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5434.96s)]
*  These videos are all out of context. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5436.52s)]
*  I'm not in Durban during this, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5437.96s)]
*  but I just, they- [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5439.400000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5440.24s)]
*  We've got some brave Indians in us. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5441.08s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5442.52s)]
*  We have some brave Indians. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5443.360000000001s)]
*  We do. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5444.2s)]
*  Sure. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5445.04s)]
*  But, and they were other examples. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5445.88s)]
*  One was a, the mob was approaching a town [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5447.599999999999s)]
*  and the people were waiting for them on a bridge. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5450.5599999999995s)]
*  And then they got there, they just couldn't enter [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5453.2s)]
*  because the people had just cordoned off their own town, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5454.76s)]
*  their own village or community, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5457.88s)]
*  and they weren't able to enter. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5459.5199999999995s)]
*  So we've had some case studies of this. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5461.4s)]
*  South Africa is a fascinating case study [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5463.12s)]
*  for a lot of things. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5465.0s)]
*  It certainly is. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5465.84s)]
*  It certainly is. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5466.72s)]
*  Can I just ask a dumb question, a childish question? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5467.88s)]
*  Why, if I'm the governor of South Africa, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5471.76s)]
*  why are you going after productive people for one thing? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5473.56s)]
*  The most productive. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5478.320000000001s)]
*  And that would include the Indians, the Afrikaners, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5481.04s)]
*  by the way, some of the black African immigrants, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5484.240000000001s)]
*  the Zimbabweans. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5487.240000000001s)]
*  These are like, are some of the most productive people. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5489.120000000001s)]
*  Why not just live in harmony, actually? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5492.04s)]
*  So wouldn't it be better for everybody? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5496.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5497.72s)]
*  Of course it would be better. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5498.56s)]
*  I think it's because they have, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5499.52s)]
*  when they took power in 1994, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5501.56s)]
*  they explicitly said, we are not a political party. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5504.16s)]
*  We are not a government in terms of what people think [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5506.799999999999s)]
*  a government should be. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5509.48s)]
*  We are a liberation movement, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5510.44s)]
*  committed to the promotion of socialism [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5512.639999999999s)]
*  and committed to the promotion of black nationalism. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5514.799999999999s)]
*  And that's their ideology. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5517.5599999999995s)]
*  They said that in 94. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5519.4s)]
*  Yeah, they even said that before 94. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5520.5599999999995s)]
*  They published it. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5522.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's just, I know I'm going back to the same themes. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5523.4s)]
*  I'm getting older, sorry. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5526.08s)]
*  But like, no, but I mean, I actually did know that [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5527.44s)]
*  because as I said, I've always been interested [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5531.2s)]
*  and I knew people there, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5533.599999999999s)]
*  but nobody in the American press mentioned that. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5534.5199999999995s)]
*  Not one person. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5537.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5538.12s)]
*  There's a well-known book [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5539.2s)]
*  that was an international bestseller, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5540.28s)]
*  My Traitor's Heart by a guy called Rian Mallon. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5542.28s)]
*  It's sort of his autobiography. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5545.5599999999995s)]
*  I've read it. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5547.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, okay. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5547.84s)]
*  And so there's one section in that book. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5548.679999999999s)]
*  I know Rian, I know the author. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5550.84s)]
*  He's a great guy, but in the book he writes about- [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5552.679999999999s)]
*  In English, I don't know if he wrote in Afrikaans originally, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5555.16s)]
*  but it's a beautifully written book. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5557.48s)]
*  It's very well written. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5558.76s)]
*  He is a very nice writer. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5559.84s)]
*  He speaks like he writes as well. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5560.68s)]
*  Oh, he does? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5561.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5562.6s)]
*  So there's one part in the book [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5563.4400000000005s)]
*  where he talks about picking up the New York Times. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5564.68s)]
*  And I'm sort of saying this from memory [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5567.240000000001s)]
*  from reading the book, but broadly speaking, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5569.08s)]
*  what he says is he picks up the New York Times [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5571.88s)]
*  in, I don't know, 1992 or something in New York or wherever. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5573.92s)]
*  And there's two stories on the same page. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5578.280000000001s)]
*  The one is about the ANC and Nelson Mandela [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5581.16s)]
*  coming to save South Africa. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5585.400000000001s)]
*  And then the other story is a somewhat smaller story [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5587.320000000001s)]
*  about a guy being necklaced in a local community, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5590.08s)]
*  a guy being viciously attacked and killed. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5593.4s)]
*  And so he writes in that book that what concerned him [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5595.92s)]
*  was that the New York Times was not able [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5600.08s)]
*  to connect these two stories to each other. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5602.0s)]
*  They didn't recognize that it's part of the same story. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5604.44s)]
*  It's presented as two completely different stories. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5606.88s)]
*  I think they knew exactly. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5609.04s)]
*  I think it was very obvious. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5610.32s)]
*  So I was 25 in 1994 and it was very obvious to me. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5611.56s)]
*  And I don't think I have any special powers of insight. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5616.5199999999995s)]
*  I think you would have to be lying to yourself [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5620.28s)]
*  or lying to your audience not to acknowledge it. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5623.8s)]
*  And by the way, it's 1994, that's less than 20 years [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5626.84s)]
*  after the Khmer Rouge took power in Phnom Penh in Cambodia. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5629.84s)]
*  That was while the Rwandan genocide was happening. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5633.36s)]
*  It was the same year as the Rwandan genocide. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5635.88s)]
*  It was later that year. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5637.2s)]
*  So the Rwandan. It was the same month even. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5638.5199999999995s)]
*  The election at least. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5640.68s)]
*  Was in July? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5642.64s)]
*  April, May, May. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5644.5199999999995s)]
*  May, okay, right. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5646.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5647.08s)]
*  Yeah, I remember them both very well. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5648.36s)]
*  And I knew people in both places at the time. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5650.16s)]
*  But I remember thinking, obviously what happened [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5652.48s)]
*  in Kigali's way, in Rwanda's way [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5654.48s)]
*  worse than anything that's happened in South Africa. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5656.32s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5658.88s)]
*  But bottom line, when bad people with bad motives [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5659.96s)]
*  stated publicly take power, it's not good. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5665.04s)]
*  So like, I don't know, that's not hard. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5668.44s)]
*  Well, there's a story from Rwanda [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5670.32s)]
*  that I keep mentioning in the same time. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5672.799999999999s)]
*  I think Linda Melvin wrote a book called [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5676.52s)]
*  Conspiracy to Murder, which is about, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5678.52s)]
*  I think she lived in Rwanda and she's a journalist [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5680.16s)]
*  and she wrote about what happened. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5681.96s)]
*  And she writes about a meeting, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5683.6s)]
*  it must have been a party in Washington [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5686.400000000001s)]
*  between American diplomats and government officials [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5688.76s)]
*  from Rwanda in the run-up, I think, to the genocide. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5692.84s)]
*  And it was just a big celebration and everyone was happy [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5696.88s)]
*  because Rwanda was in the process of becoming a democracy. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5700.240000000001s)]
*  And then afterwards, someone asked one of the Americans, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5703.64s)]
*  but did you not know what was happening in Rwanda? [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5707.120000000001s)]
*  That they were on the verge of committing genocide? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5709.76s)]
*  And he said, the American diplomat said, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5713.120000000001s)]
*  yes, we knew, but we were so excited about democracy [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5715.88s)]
*  and Rwanda becoming a democracy. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5719.200000000001s)]
*  We didn't want to spoil the mood by confronting them. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5720.72s)]
*  That sounds like an American diplomat. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5723.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5725.320000000001s)]
*  So that's very, very alarming, this idea of being so excited [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5727.52s)]
*  about a potential idea that you are not willing [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5730.72s)]
*  to confront the realities that's happening [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5734.92s)]
*  or that could potentially unfold. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5737.76s)]
*  Or being unwilling to clearly define your terms. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5740.2s)]
*  Like what is democracy actually? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5742.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think that's an underlying. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5744.92s)]
*  It's an underlying problem. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5747.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5748.2s)]
*  And it's a problem that's only surfaced in this country [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5749.04s)]
*  in the last couple of years. Can I give you an example [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5751.76s)]
*  of that from the South African perspective? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5753.0s)]
*  So I mentioned the name changes, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5754.8s)]
*  it's a big thing in South Africa. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5756.68s)]
*  I'm sure that'll fix your problems. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5758.68s)]
*  Will that bring the electricity and water back? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5759.8s)]
*  No, obviously. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5761.68s)]
*  So there's a town called Ammanzum Toti, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5763.24s)]
*  which is on the East coast of South Africa. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5765.360000000001s)]
*  The main street was named Kingsway. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5768.400000000001s)]
*  They changed it to Andrew Zandu Street. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5771.360000000001s)]
*  Now, Andrew Zandu is really only known for one thing. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5773.56s)]
*  He was a member of the ANC Youth League, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5776.24s)]
*  and I believe it was 1985. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5778.16s)]
*  He planted a bomb in a shopping center [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5780.88s)]
*  and he killed, I think, five people and injured 40. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5783.24s)]
*  All of the people who were killed were women and children. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5786.12s)]
*  That's the only thing he did. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5789.0s)]
*  And he was a member of the ANC Youth League. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5789.96s)]
*  The ANC regards that event as something that they claim [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5792.0s)]
*  as an act of heroism. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5795.32s)]
*  So they named the main street after him. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5797.96s)]
*  And so there are people in that town who drive to work [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5800.84s)]
*  in a street named after the person who killed their children. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5803.56s)]
*  And now they would say that they need to do [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5808.12s)]
*  these name changes to make sure [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5810.52s)]
*  that they get rid of offensive names. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5812.24s)]
*  Offensive names are Afrikaans names, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5814.08s)]
*  names linked to South Africa's past. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5816.2s)]
*  And so I was at, again, a summit where this was discussed. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5818.96s)]
*  And I mentioned this. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5822.639999999999s)]
*  I said, so you say that in Pretoria, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5823.88s)]
*  Church Street is an offensive name and has to be changed. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5826.8s)]
*  In Ammanza Mtohti, you changed Kingsway to Andrew Zandu. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5830.24s)]
*  And I tell this story. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5833.679999999999s)]
*  And I said, so who decides if it's offensive or not? [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5834.5199999999995s)]
*  And the guy said, oh, well, that's easy. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5838.32s)]
*  The majority decides. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5839.76s)]
*  And so, but it's not even the majority. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5841.5199999999995s)]
*  It's just the government. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5843.639999999999s)]
*  The government decides because they believe [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5844.76s)]
*  they are the majority. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5846.280000000001s)]
*  So we have these extremely offensive things happening [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5847.56s)]
*  under the banner of- [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5849.84s)]
*  Well, they're murderous. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5850.68s)]
*  I mean, again, I just, yeah. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5851.72s)]
*  I think it's, the picture is really, really clear. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5854.96s)]
*  You know, it couldn't be clearer. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5859.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5861.68s)]
*  How do you, you're staying. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5863.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, definitely. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5865.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we'll stay. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5866.56s)]
*  You guys must love your country. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5867.92s)]
*  Yeah, we really do. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5869.68s)]
*  I mean, in South Africa, everyone who's been to South Africa [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5870.52s)]
*  would say it's an incredibly beautiful country [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5873.0s)]
*  and it truly is. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5874.84s)]
*  And it's a country that unfortunately has suffered so much [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5876.16s)]
*  under this current government [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5879.08s)]
*  and has suffered so much in the past. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5881.08s)]
*  One of our Afrikaans philosophers, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5883.72s)]
*  a man named N. Pierre van Weycklow wrote, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5886.04s)]
*  I think in the 1930s or something, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5888.04s)]
*  that you love a people not so much for their accomplishments [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5890.32s)]
*  as for the hardships that they've had to endure. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5894.72s)]
*  That's right. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5897.2s)]
*  And I think that's true for South Africa. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5898.04s)]
*  South Africa has endured many hardships [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5900.0s)]
*  and also for our people, the Afrikaner people, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5901.92s)]
*  as with many other peoples all over the world, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5904.0s)]
*  have endured many hardships. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5906.2s)]
*  And it's through these hardships [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5908.16s)]
*  and maintaining our sense of identity [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5909.84s)]
*  that we really love our history and our tradition [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5912.56s)]
*  and our culture. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5915.92s)]
*  Well, you came in the first place [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5916.76s)]
*  because you were an oppressed minority, correct? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5917.6s)]
*  Yep. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5919.12s)]
*  I know the French did. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5919.96s)]
*  Yes, the French Huguenots, yes. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5920.8s)]
*  It was the fleeing the religious wars in Europe. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5923.04s)]
*  Of course, they were getting killed. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5924.88s)]
*  Yes, in big numbers. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5926.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5927.68s)]
*  That's part of our origin story, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5928.52s)]
*  how we came to be. Well, it's also factually true. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5932.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. It's part of history. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5933.92s)]
*  I mean, it's not a myth, it's real. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5935.120000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes, absolutely. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5936.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so do you think, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5937.6s)]
*  I don't know what the resolution will be, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5941.08s)]
*  and I'm certainly rooting for all South Africans [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5943.08s)]
*  of every color, but, fervently, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5945.72s)]
*  but I gotta think that being able to say [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5948.56s)]
*  certain obvious truths out loud helps. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5952.320000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5955.72s)]
*  Do you think? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5956.56s)]
*  Well, the problem is if you do that, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5958.400000000001s)]
*  you get bashed quite aggressively. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5960.88s)]
*  Yeah, but like, compared to what? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5963.8s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5965.76s)]
*  You just said, we're taking your land [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5966.599999999999s)]
*  because your skin color's so white. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5967.679999999999s)]
*  Well, the alternative is worse. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5968.5199999999995s)]
*  It's just living the lie. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5969.679999999999s)]
*  It's much worse than getting bashed for telling the truth. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5970.8s)]
*  Can I tell you a quick story, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5975.24s)]
*  or a quick reference about courage? [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5977.72s)]
*  Of course. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5979.04s)]
*  So, it's somewhat philosophical, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5979.88s)]
*  but I'll make it practical. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5982.0s)]
*  So Odysseus is on his way back from the Trojan War, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5983.12s)]
*  and he has all these hardships, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5986.48s)]
*  and he's trying to get home, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5988.72s)]
*  and he gets told that the only way for him to get home [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5990.6s)]
*  is to face Scylla and Corriptus. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5993.72s)]
*  Scylla is this six-headed sea monster, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5996.68s)]
*  and Corriptus is a monstrous whirlpool [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=5999.92s)]
*  that swallows ships whole. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6001.96s)]
*  And the only way for him to get home [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6004.2s)]
*  is he has to navigate through these two monsters, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6005.6s)]
*  which he eventually does. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6009.12s)]
*  He decides it's better for him to move, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6010.2s)]
*  to sail his ship closer to Scylla, [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6012.400000000001s)]
*  the sea monster, than the whirlpool, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6014.84s)]
*  and a whole lot of his people die, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6017.4s)]
*  but he reaches his destination. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6019.08s)]
*  And so Aristotle writes about this [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6021.2s)]
*  in the Nicomachean Ethics, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6022.879999999999s)]
*  and when he talks about the golden mean, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6024.639999999999s)]
*  and he says any virtue is about finding the balance [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6026.4s)]
*  between having excess of it and having a deficiency of it. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6029.5199999999995s)]
*  And so this goes to courage, and courage is a good example. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6033.16s)]
*  If you have excess courage, you become reckless. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6035.92s)]
*  And if you have a deficiency, then you are a coward. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6039.0s)]
*  And so the point of having courage [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6041.879999999999s)]
*  is finding the balance between cowardice and recklessness. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6044.36s)]
*  And what's great about the story of Odysseus [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6048.08s)]
*  is Odysseus discovers that he cannot simply go exactly [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6050.5599999999995s)]
*  in the middle between the two. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6055.12s)]
*  He has to be closer to the one threat than to the other, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6056.92s)]
*  because if he goes too close to the whirlpool, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6060.08s)]
*  these old ship gets swallowed up. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6062.2s)]
*  And so the point here, and Aristotle says this as well, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6064.759999999999s)]
*  it's not to find the exact middle point, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6066.92s)]
*  it's to find the appropriate balance [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6068.639999999999s)]
*  between the two extremes. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6070.44s)]
*  And so the one extreme is recklessness, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6072.08s)]
*  and the other extreme is cowardice. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6073.68s)]
*  And I honestly think in the situation we are in, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6075.280000000001s)]
*  it's better to err on the side of being too bold [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6079.360000000001s)]
*  than to err on the side of having not enough courage [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6082.8s)]
*  or trying to find some form of solution through appeasement. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6085.92s)]
*  And so we make mistakes in the process, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6090.08s)]
*  and sometimes you say something wrong [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6091.84s)]
*  or you do something wrong. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6093.76s)]
*  But I'm very much convinced that if we're on this course [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6094.76s)]
*  and we try to pursue what we are trying to pursue, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6100.200000000001s)]
*  rather err on the side of having too much boldness [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6103.2s)]
*  and too much courage and facing the consequences [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6105.5199999999995s)]
*  than having to face the consequences [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6108.36s)]
*  of having a lack of courage. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6109.92s)]
*  I love that. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6112.5199999999995s)]
*  I gotta say, in a lifetime of travel, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6114.16s)]
*  if I could just generalize, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6116.2s)]
*  the two most impressive groups I meet everywhere, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6118.12s)]
*  my whole life, around the world, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6122.599999999999s)]
*  both groups living in exile in large numbers, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6124.5199999999995s)]
*  are the South Africans and the Lebanese. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6127.0s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6129.28s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6130.12s)]
*  I've never met one of either group I didn't like [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6130.94s)]
*  and didn't admire. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6133.16s)]
*  I don't think I've met one in either group. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6134.0s)]
*  And the thing that they have in common [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6135.0s)]
*  is they live in beautiful, volatile countries [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6136.839999999999s)]
*  that they really love, but they're very hard to live in. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6139.08s)]
*  And so they're caught between that tension, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6142.36s)]
*  cowardice and recklessness, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6146.0s)]
*  and they're making that calculation every single day. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6147.24s)]
*  And they're living so thoughtfully and so purposefully [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6149.0s)]
*  and in such a, I don't know, just a admirable, noble way. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6152.44s)]
*  I've just noticed that. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6157.08s)]
*  Oh, I appreciate the comment. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6158.2s)]
*  Just an observation, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6162.16s)]
*  but I've thought about it many times. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6163.4s)]
*  Last question, where can people who have made it this far [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6164.879999999999s)]
*  into the interview and are interested [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6169.0s)]
*  in what's happening in your country [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6171.5599999999995s)]
*  and happening to your group, how can they follow it? [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6173.839999999999s)]
*  How can they be helpful? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6178.48s)]
*  How can they learn more and be supportive? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6180.839999999999s)]
*  Well, I think there are many ways. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6182.5199999999995s)]
*  The one way is just to follow what's happening [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6184.96s)]
*  in South Africa and speak about it. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6187.96s)]
*  Because we've had this incredible barrage [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6189.88s)]
*  of communications coming, [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6192.400000000001s)]
*  just telling us again how wrong we are. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6194.4400000000005s)]
*  This narrative is this zeitgeist in a certain sense. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6196.64s)]
*  It's really like a monster that you have to fight, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6199.4800000000005s)]
*  that you're not allowed to speak certain truths, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6203.360000000001s)]
*  even though the truths are self-evident. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6205.56s)]
*  So I think one thing is if people [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6207.84s)]
*  just can help spread the message, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6209.360000000001s)]
*  help take some interest in South Africa, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6210.88s)]
*  because what's happening in South Africa [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6212.64s)]
*  is also of interest to the rest of the world. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6213.96s)]
*  I think it is. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6215.68s)]
*  In many ways, South Africa is the future [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6216.52s)]
*  of the Western world. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6217.88s)]
*  I know. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6218.72s)]
*  In terms of the problem and the solution, I think. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6220.72s)]
*  So that's one. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6222.76s)]
*  And then the other is there really are some institutions [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6223.6s)]
*  in South Africa who are really focused [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6225.8s)]
*  on building community-based solutions. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6228.8s)]
*  And I think if people can identify these institutions [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6231.24s)]
*  and support these institutions, it really would help. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6234.72s)]
*  And I think in terms of the US government, [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6238.280000000001s)]
*  if the US government is willing to do something [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6240.360000000001s)]
*  as it seems that they are, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6243.04s)]
*  I think the most important thing that they could do [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6244.8s)]
*  is a combination of pressuring the South African government [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6247.08s)]
*  from away from these destructive policies, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6250.64s)]
*  but also supporting communities, local communities, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6253.32s)]
*  or minority communities, or nations, you should say, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6256.4s)]
*  who are committed to finding some form of self-determination. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6259.4s)]
*  Amen. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6263.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, Godspeed. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6264.36s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6265.5199999999995s)]
*  I hope to see you again. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6266.36s)]
*  I hope you'll come back. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6267.2s)]
*  I'll thank you. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6268.2s)]
*  I hope so too. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6269.04s)]
*  And then I have to thank you for, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6269.88s)]
*  not just for this interview, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6271.04s)]
*  but also for the focus you've been putting [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6272.12s)]
*  on South Africa in the past. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6274.48s)]
*  Well, it's just so interesting [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6276.08s)]
*  and it reveals so much about us. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6277.52s)]
*  I'm American and it reveals a lot about our leadership class [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6278.84s)]
*  and I think it's important to say it. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6281.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6283.280000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6284.12s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6284.96s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6289.68s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6293.0s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6294.52s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6295.360000000001s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6297.04s)]
*  all the change taking place in our economy and our politics, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6298.96s)]
*  with the wars, when the cusp of fighting right now, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6302.56s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6305.56s)]
*  rather than more. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6308.56s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6309.92s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6311.92s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6313.320000000001s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6314.84s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6316.280000000001s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6317.4400000000005s)]
*  or we could find a way around it, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6318.4800000000005s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that is true, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6319.76s)]
*  not intentionally deceptive. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6323.04s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6324.76s)]
*  it's to subscribe to our channel. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6326.84s)]
*  Subscribe. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6328.360000000001s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6329.200000000001s)]
*  when we upload and share this video. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6331.320000000001s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6333.72s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6335.88s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNHGXNp5m4&t=6338.84s)]
