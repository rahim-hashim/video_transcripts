# Sen. Ron Johnson: What’s Really in the “Big Beautiful Bill,” and Uncovering the Truth About 9-11
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk)
*  You tried the other day to raise science-based questions about 9-11 and you asked, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=0.0s)]
*  a building seven was never hit by a plane, why did it fall down in exactly the same way the first two towers did? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5.44s)]
*  156 witnesses, you know, first responders saying they heard explosions before the buildings came down. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=9.92s)]
*  There was never a steel building that ever collapsed because of a fire. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  The vaccine injured. So these would be American citizens who obeyed their government and took [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=19.12s)]
*  a shot that they were required to take and then were injured by or killed by that shot. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=25.68s)]
*  To date worldwide there's over 38,000 deaths associated with COVID vaccine. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  24% of those to date either occur on the date of vaccination or within one or two days. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=34.56s)]
*  We're right now burning about a half a trillion dollars a quarter just to get us by into next year. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  That should shock everybody and that's my whole purpose here. We haven't talked about the numbers, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=45.84s)]
*  we haven't put this in context of the big mess we're in, the deep hole we've dug ourselves, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=50.08s)]
*  and I'm just going to force that debate. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=57.36s)]
*  So you told me something that made me laugh at breakfast in a dark way, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=59.68s)]
*  which is that very few of the people you work with, your colleagues, whose job it is to appropriate [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=84.16s)]
*  money to run the US government, have any idea how much they're appropriating. They don't know what [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=92.56s)]
*  the numbers are. Can you walk us through a description of the ignorance of Congress when [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=97.76s)]
*  it comes to numbers? So you want me to throw my colleagues under the bus? No, it was just like, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=104.16s)]
*  I was amazed by what you told me. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=110.24s)]
*  Of the dollars they appropriate, they know that. That's only 25% of the budget. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  The story I told you at breakfast is a couple years ago, this is after the COVID spending spree, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=116.64s)]
*  but we continued on that spending spree. We were in the midst of an omnibus spending debate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=122.24s)]
*  And this is where McConnell was doing a deal with Schumer on a massive omnibus spending bill. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  And we were going to violate for the first time our conference's position on earmarks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=134.88s)]
*  Our conference's position is we do not accept earmarks. All of a sudden, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=141.36s)]
*  the Republican Senate is going to be accepting earmarks. So I got up in front of the group, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=145.12s)]
*  I'm generally the skunk in the room or the kid who says the emperor has no clothes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=151.12s)]
*  I just asked my colleagues, hey, anybody know how much we spent last year in total? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=156.24s)]
*  Dead silence. I went out to the washroom press. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=161.36s)]
*  By which you meant what we spent last year. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=164.24s)]
*  The federal government, what the federal government spent in total. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=166.16s)]
*  No, just the bottom line. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  If anybody knew, they didn't volunteer. And I went out to the Washington press corps, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=170.72s)]
*  asked them the same question. And one of the reporters said, well, it's over a trillion dollars. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=174.88s)]
*  Now that's just discretionary spending. That's about 25% of the budget. I mean, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  total spending. The answer is, I think, $6.3 trillion. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  Understand the federal government is the largest financial entity in the world. We in theory are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=187.28s)]
*  the 535 members of the board of directors. And nobody really knows in total how much the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=193.44s)]
*  federal government spent because we never talk about it. And as that relates to the current- [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=200.32s)]
*  Oh, weird thing not to talk about, since that's your job. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=206.56s)]
*  But that's how it's been set up. Discretionary, which we appropriate, and then mandatory. That [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=210.72s)]
*  just gets spent. It's on automatic pilot. So it's out of sight, it's out of mind, and it's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=216.48s)]
*  completely out of control. May I ask how that works? So I thought the constitution gave the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=220.64s)]
*  Congress the responsibility, the duty to appropriate the money. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=226.88s)]
*  So Congress has written laws like the Social Security law, then Medicare and Medicaid, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  and they've turned, they call those entitlements. So it doesn't make, they're not annually [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=238.72s)]
*  appropriated. It's just you set up a law saying if you qualify, you get X number of dollars. So it's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  on automatic pilot. And there's no cap on that spending? No, none. You qualify, you get it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=250.16s)]
*  So whatever it takes- What has happened over the years is in addition to Social Security and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=255.6s)]
*  Medicare and Medicaid, they slid what should be in my mind, discretionary spending into mandatory. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  And so I'm the guy that pointed out the conference again. You guys realized in 2019, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=266.32s)]
*  other mandatory, again, not Social Security, not Medicare, not Medicaid, other mandatory, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=271.44s)]
*  pretty well runs the gamut of other appropriation accounts. That was $642 billion. Last year, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=276.08s)]
*  fiscal year 2024, that was $1.3 trillion. This year, it's a little over a trillion. And that's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=283.52s)]
*  pretty much as far as the eye can see according to CBO, $1 trillion. So again, total discretionary [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=288.96s)]
*  spending is about $1.7 trillion. But they've literally slid about $1 trillion now ongoing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  of other mandatory into or what should be discretionary into what they call the other [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=302.0s)]
*  mandatory, $1 trillion. And I don't think anybody was really aware of that either. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=307.68s)]
*  So what's right now for 2025, or let's say 2024, what did the federal government spend total? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=313.6s)]
*  So let me so in 2019, total federal government spending was $4.4 trillion. Yes. This year, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=321.84s)]
*  we will spend over $7 trillion. So better way. I remember somewhere around during the Obama [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=327.84s)]
*  administration, about when I got elected 2010, 2011, we had our first trillion dollar a year [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  deficit in 2009, you know, there's 1.4 trillion. And we stopped talking about hundreds of billions, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  which used to move the needle to now trillions. And 1234567, it just doesn't seem that much. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=347.76s)]
*  $4400 billion spent in 2019, $7000 billion spent this year, projected to spend $7300 billion [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=354.64s)]
*  next year. And now let's kind of bring this back to the debate that we're talking about on the one [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=364.72s)]
*  big beautiful bill. Wait, may I just one more bottom line number? Okay, so we're going to spend [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=369.84s)]
*  over $7 trillion this year, how much do we take in and tax receipts every year? About 5.1. So we've [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=373.52s)]
*  got a structural deficit of around 6% right now, CBO is projecting over the next 10 years, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=379.52s)]
*  6%. So federal revenue will be according to CBO 18.1, even though it's about 17.1. But they're [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=384.56s)]
*  projecting that we're going to increase or have an automatic tax increase next year. So they [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  bumped that to 18.1. And federal spending is going to be about 23.4, 23.5%. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=394.96s)]
*  So that deficit spending, where does that money come from? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=403.84s)]
*  We borrow it, or we print it. But we put this in even better historical context in 1930, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=407.2s)]
*  less than 100 years ago. The federal government spent 3.1% of our GDP. State and local governments [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=414.48s)]
*  back then spent 9.1%. So that was pretty much the vision of our founding fathers, a limited [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  federal government, you know, within the constraints of the enumerated powers and most governing [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=428.24s)]
*  at the point of the states, you know, state and local governments where it's more accountable, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  more efficient, more effective. And we've blown that up. Now the federal government spending [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=437.92s)]
*  close to 24%. State and local governments are over 16%. So now total government spending is about [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  40%. It's three times what it was back less than 100 years ago. And I would argue, as government [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=448.0s)]
*  grows, our freedoms necessarily recede. Of course. Because government has more claim on your income, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=455.92s)]
*  or they borrow money, which causes inflation, which is a silent tax. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=462.64s)]
*  Do you, we have any sense of what percentage of the American population, 350 million or whatever [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=466.88s)]
*  it is in that range, our net receivers get more from government than they pay in? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=471.2s)]
*  My guess it's more than 50%. And of course, that's the death knell of a democracy is when [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=477.36s)]
*  the population, the voting public realizes they can vote themselves [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  benefits at the expense of somebody else. What they don't realize- [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=488.4s)]
*  The expenses, it's costing them all because the massive deficit spending, because we're not taking [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  enough revenue to cover the expenditures. That's what has eroded the value of our dollar. That's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=497.76s)]
*  what caused 40 year high inflation. And that hurts everybody. So you think that most at this point, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=502.48s)]
*  your guess is most Americans receive more from the federal government, from government? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=508.48s)]
*  Again, I shouldn't even say because I haven't checked that figure. Yeah. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=512.96s)]
*  My guess is probably more than 50%. When you consider all the entitlements, whether it's [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=517.2s)]
*  social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and people say, that's my money. Well, in some cases it is. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=522.0s)]
*  Most people probably get more out of social security than they actually did put in. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=529.28s)]
*  Certainly do that out of Medicare, certainly out of Medicaid. Nobody puts any money into that. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=534.0s)]
*  That all comes out of the general fund. So we have food stamps, we have all these [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  trillions of dollars worth of transfer payments. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=542.8s)]
*  Why is this not sustainable? You often hear it's not sustainable. What happens if it continues? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=548.0s)]
*  Well, again, when I ran in 2010, we'd just experienced our first [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  deficits in excess of a trillion dollars. We were spending about $3.5 trillion a year. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=561.92s)]
*  So it's more than double just since 2010? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=568.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. We were $14 trillion in debt. I remember I announced in April of 2010, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=571.12s)]
*  started my campaign in basically June 2010 doing parades. And what I would shout is this is a fight [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=581.12s)]
*  for freedom. We're mortgaging our children's future. It's wrong. It's immoral. It has to stop. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=587.12s)]
*  That was my campaign theme. Again, we were $14 trillion in debt, spending $3.5 trillion. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=592.64s)]
*  Now we're almost $37 trillion in debt. We're spending $7,000 billion, $7 trillion. And [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=599.04s)]
*  CBO projects over the next 10 years, we will add another $22 trillion to the debt. That's what our [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=607.28s)]
*  projected deficits over the next 10 years is $22 trillion. Again, that's assuming about a $4 trillion [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=615.44s)]
*  increase because of taxes are scheduled to automatically increase. If those taxes don't [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=622.32s)]
*  increase, first of all, I'm not sure you get the full $4 trillion. But again, take $4 trillion away [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=627.28s)]
*  if we extend current tax law, which is I'm in favor of that. I don't want to increase anybody's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  taxes. But I don't think this is necessarily time to do additional tax cuts, particularly when those [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=639.52s)]
*  things aren't focused toward economic growth. But anyway, just real quick. So we are projecting [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=645.12s)]
*  deficits for the next 10 years of a minimum of $2.2 trillion. And I would argue that is a [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=651.6s)]
*  rosy scenario. And particularly when you take a look at what they've done with the one big, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=657.0400000000001s)]
*  beautiful bill, they're not seriously reducing spending to what I've been calling for as a [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=661.84s)]
*  pre-pandemic level. Again, the danger is spouting out too many numbers here. I just want to put this [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=666.64s)]
*  in perspective. President Obama over the course of his eight years, his average deficit was $910 [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=675.6s)]
*  billion. Over the last, and I want to do this so I'm accurate, over the last four years of his [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=682.88s)]
*  administration is about $550 billion. Okay, so half a trillion dollar deficit over his last four years. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=690.0s)]
*  President Trump came into office in his first three years, the average deficit was about $800 billion. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=698.64s)]
*  So he bumped up Obama's four year average from $550 to $800. Then COVID hit, and we had a deficit of [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=704.8s)]
*  $3.1 trillion just that one year. Now what we should have done in 2021 when Biden came into office is we [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=712.24s)]
*  should have returned to a reasonable pre-pandemic level. The pandemic was over. We didn't have to [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=719.52s)]
*  keep, you know, we had unemployment spike up to I think 25 million people, normal unemployment somewhere [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=723.76s)]
*  between five and six, but within a few months it was around 11 and then returned to pretty much [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=729.04s)]
*  normal early in 2021. We didn't have to keep stimulating the economy, but Biden did. Biden [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=733.5999999999999s)]
*  averaged $1.9 trillion per year in deficit. So Obama when he left, his last four years, $550. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=739.36s)]
*  Trump before the pandemic, a little more than $800 billion per year. Biden in his four years went up [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=747.76s)]
*  to $1.9 trillion and now CBO is projecting, again, a rosy scenario that will be averaging $2.2 trillion [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=754.48s)]
*  over the next 10 years. So we'll take our debt from $37 trillion up to $59 trillion. And [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=763.6s)]
*  if we extend the current tax law, take away $4 trillion in revenue, roughly, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=774.32s)]
*  that add another $4 trillion. The spending cuts are talking about, they're paltry. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=780.08s)]
*  $1.5 trillion, some of those are fake, some of those are extended way out. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=788.16s)]
*  They're offset by 10 years. 10 years? Yeah, I mean, we'll spend the money up front for the border, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  for defense. So that also takes away from that $1.5 trillion in spending. So at most we're [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=799.44s)]
*  maybe cutting spending $1.2 trillion. Part of that, a few hundred billion, I think, is [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=806.0s)]
*  student loan forgiveness, which the Supreme Court will probably rule unconstitutional. We're not [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=810.56s)]
*  going to spend it anyway, but they count that as savings. So much of the savings they're talking [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=814.64s)]
*  about in the one big beautiful bill is phony, it's fake. Or it's in the out years where if [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=818.96s)]
*  Republicans lose power, Democrats will just restore it. But no matter how you slice it, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=824.32s)]
*  from my standpoint, CBO's $22 trillion of tenure deficit is a rosy scenario. It'll probably be more [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=830.32s)]
*  than that. And what happens then is what's happening right now in the bond market. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=837.84s)]
*  Interest rates are creeping up. You can't control that. If global creditors look at the United [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=844.0s)]
*  States as an uncredit worthy. Our 50 year average interest payment that we paid on our debt is over [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=849.5200000000001s)]
*  5%. So I think it's as high as 5.8. It's not the most exact figure. But right now we're borrowing [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=856.16s)]
*  probably about 3.3%. That's been the average over the last 25 years, 3.3%. And that's kind of where [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=864.48s)]
*  we're at right now. If we increased that interest, if that interest expense increases to, or rate [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=869.92s)]
*  increases to 4.3%, add another $4 trillion in deficit spending. If it goes up to the 50 year [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=876.48s)]
*  average of 5.3, add about $8 or $9 trillion to the $22 trillion. So again, you go $22 trillion plus [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=882.4s)]
*  extending current tax law, add another close to $4 trillion. If interest rates start creeping up, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=890.8s)]
*  and they are, just one percentage point, add another $4 trillion. So you can see very quickly, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=896.48s)]
*  you go from $22 to $26 to $30 trillion, add down to $37 trillion, or up to $67 trillion in debt. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=901.12s)]
*  I don't think we'd ever hit that. I think something's going to happen. We'll have a [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=909.04s)]
*  debt crisis. We'll have failure in our bond auctions, spiking interest rates even more. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=912.16s)]
*  And again, we're spending more on interest this year than we spend on defense. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=917.52s)]
*  Here's an alarming statistic. Only 12% of Americans are metabolically healthy. That means 88% are not. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=921.12s)]
*  It's not a healthy country. Friend of the show and Donald Trump's Surgeon General nominee, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=927.76s)]
*  Dr. Casey Means, is working to solve that crisis. She's got a new healthcare technology company. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=932.4s)]
*  It's called Levels. It's got an easy to use app, simple and effective programs. It helps you get [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=937.36s)]

*  manage your weight, exercise more effectively. And it works. We've heard a ton of stories. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=948.0s)]
*  People on our show who work here, changing their lives, getting their cholesterol under control, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=952.0s)]
*  improving their diets, making their movement much more efficient, their exercise better. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=956.08s)]
*  Levels membership comes with a 28 marker cardio metabolic blood test. It gives you a comprehensive [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=961.9200000000001s)]

*  word that Levels is offering this show's listeners annual memberships with an additional two months [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=978.48s)]
*  free through the website levels.link.slash.tucker. We're not sure how long this is going to last. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=983.2800000000001s)]
*  We recommend you take advantage of it. The address levels.link.slash.tucker. You often [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=990.08s)]
*  hear the phrase debt crisis. What does that mean exactly? What would that look like? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=996.32s)]
*  Depends whether it's a chronic or acute crisis. I'd say we're already in a chronic debt crisis. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1001.12s)]
*  That is what I would consider the devaluation of the dollar. I laid out, we talked about this, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  my pre-pandemic options going back to 98, 2014, 2019. So a dollar you held in 1998 [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1011.84s)]
*  is only worth 51 cents a day. Ouch. A dollar you held when I- It's devalued that much? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1018.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's been cut in half. When I ran 2010, that dollar is worth about 68 cents. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1023.8399999999999s)]
*  A dollar you held during Obama in 2014 is worth 74 cents. A dollar we held just in 2019 is only [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1029.76s)]
*  worth 80 cents. So again, that is the devaluation of the dollar. That's inflation. This is why [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1036.3999999999999s)]
*  everything is so expensive. Yeah, that's a silent tax. That's how you spend 300 bucks at dinner [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1041.9199999999998s)]
*  and you're like, I didn't even get drunk. How did that happen? That's the effect. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1046.96s)]
*  Yeah, and that's why you had 40-year high inflation. So that I would consider the chronic [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1050.72s)]
*  debt crisis. It just continues. It's the danger. We have not tamed inflation yet. We've tamed it, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1055.6000000000001s)]
*  but we haven't conquered it. So I think that's always on the horizon, particularly if we continue [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1063.3600000000001s)]
*  deficit spend. Particularly if the bond markets continue to react as they are, keep driving [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1067.1200000000001s)]
*  interest rates up higher and you start increasing the amount of interest expense crowding out other [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1074.08s)]
*  spending. So an acute debt crisis would be where you have a bond market failure. Like what happened [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1079.04s)]
*  to Greece. All of a sudden, you can't sell your debt. So you either print the money, which sparks [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1086.56s)]
*  another round of 40-50-year high inflation, devaluing the currency rapidly. We're not necessarily [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1091.1999999999998s)]
*  immune to hyperinflation. Other countries have experienced it. So a failure to sell your debt [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1099.52s)]
*  in a bond auction, what does that look like? You just put out your bonds and nobody wants them? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1109.36s)]
*  Nobody buys them. So again, the advantage the US has over any other country is we are the world's [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1114.56s)]
*  reserve currency. So we can print dollars. So we can get by that moment, except for you printing [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1120.72s)]
*  dollars and inflation is pretty easy to define. It's too many dollars chasing too few goods. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1127.6s)]
*  So you just print all those dollars and again, the dollar devalues, the cost of your debt [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1134.32s)]
*  is lowered. It's a silent way of addressing these massive deficits. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1140.56s)]
*  How far away from a moment like that are we? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1148.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I would have thought we would have experienced it by now, but we've experienced it [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1150.24s)]
*  instead as again, 40-year high inflation, the devaluation of the currency. I think that's pretty [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1156.8s)]
*  shocking when you take a look at that as a dollar just 11 years ago is only worth 74 cents. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1162.1599999999999s)]
*  Six years, it's only worth 80 cents. That's an amazing level of devaluation. Now it's not even [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1170.56s)]
*  close to hyperinflation where you've got inflation rates of hundreds of percent. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1177.28s)]
*  But so when that crisis comes, what do you do? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1184.08s)]
*  Well, you have a great deal of terminal in your society. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1189.52s)]
*  It won't be pleasant. It's just what we need to try and avoid. And by the way, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1195.1999999999998s)]
*  why I'm not in a full blown panic, people like Art Laffer, the economist at the Laffer Curve, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1200.08s)]
*  he does correctly point out America has enormous wealth. I mean, hundreds of trillions of dollars [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1206.48s)]
*  worth of wealth. So 37 billion, 37 trillion dollars in relationship to hundreds of trillion dollars [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1214.0s)]
*  worth of wealth, that's manageable. It's just like if you're a billionaire, but you don't work, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1220.16s)]
*  you can have some pretty large mortgages on homes, but you still have to generate some income to [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1228.0s)]
*  service the debt. And I think that's kind of the point we're making. I mean, it's not irrelevant [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1234.64s)]
*  debt to GDP ratio. And we do have massive wealth, but we need to manage the cash flow problem here [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1239.8400000000001s)]
*  too, as well as just the pernicious impact of all these transfer payments, providing encouragement [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1248.08s)]
*  for people not to work. There's a great article written, I think, in 2017 by Nick Eberstadt [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1257.28s)]
*  of the American Enterprise Institute, our miserable 21st century, talking about how 20% of working age [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1262.48s)]
*  men are permanently out of the workforce, on Medicaid, using the Medicaid card to buy opiate [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1268.0s)]
*  drugs to help finance their living. All those pernicious impacts of a society where we literally [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1273.76s)]
*  don't require people to work, we actually incentivize them not to. To my mind, that's one [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1283.92s)]
*  of the biggest problems we have with the big wealth risk. And you need mass immigration to fill the gap. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1290.8s)]
*  Yeah, somebody's got to do the work. And we were talking earlier, when I first [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1294.5600000000002s)]
*  entered this political realm, going to dairy breakfast, the first issue I heard in Wisconsin [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1299.1200000000001s)]
*  was, we don't have enough workers. I come from a manufacturing background where for 20 or so years, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1303.8400000000001s)]
*  you couldn't find enough people to work in a manufacturing plant, which is why I always kind [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1309.68s)]
*  of scratched my head. Listen, there are certainly products that we have offshore that we need to [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1314.48s)]
*  reshore, things that are strategic that impact our national security. But right now, I think our [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1320.3999999999999s)]
*  biggest problem is we don't have enough workers. If you bring all this manufacturing back to America, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1326.8s)]
*  who's going to work the factories? And we certainly shouldn't be bringing back [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1331.6799999999998s)]
*  high labor content product. I think you need to diversify your supply base. You can't be so [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  dependent on an adversary like China. Spread it around. That would reduce your risk. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1341.04s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell So, what you're saying, like the numbers you're describing are the bottom line [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1346.0s)]
*  numbers. This is not like higher math. This should be obvious to everybody. What's the reaction been? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1353.52s)]
*  Dave Korsunsky Well, they just ignore it. Again, one of the reasons I'm digging my heels in, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1358.96s)]
*  as the one big beautiful bill comes over the Senate, is we haven't had the discussion or [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1365.84s)]
*  the debate. The only number you heard about in the whole House debate here was $1.5 trillion, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1370.64s)]
*  which sounds like a lot, right? I mean, $1.5 trillion in spending reduction. And of course, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1377.2s)]
*  they're focusing on programs like Medicaid. The main problem with that is Obamacare, which is now [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1381.92s)]
*  called Medicaid expansion, along states to gain the system, putting at risk Medicaid for the truly [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1387.8400000000001s)]
*  vulnerable. But that's all you really heard about. You don't ever put that in context. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1392.88s)]
*  $1.5 trillion compared to $89 trillion spending over the next 10 years, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1399.6s)]
*  it's barely a rounding error. We haven't been talking about the massive annual deficits. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1404.56s)]
*  We don't talk about the debt. Aaron Ross Powell [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1410.8799999999999s)]
*  Why is the, I mean, when you were describing the progression of debt accumulation, it feels like [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1413.6s)]
*  it's been really rapid in a short period of time. Like the federal government spending almost twice [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1420.6399999999999s)]
*  what it was just the other day. Where's all that money going? How did that happen? What is that? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1426.24s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Well, again, it was really sparked by [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1430.24s)]
*  the pandemic. I'll give the Tea Party movement a fair amount of credit. I ran because we were [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1434.0s)]
*  more in the kids' future. We were running deficits for, I think, three years in a row, over $1 trillion. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1441.04s)]
*  But once we got to town in 2011, we started having these budget debates. We had divided [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1447.44s)]
*  government. Obama didn't get everything he wanted. We did something called the Budget Control Act, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1452.32s)]
*  which literally reduced discretionary spending for three years in a row until we learned how to [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1457.28s)]
*  weasel around it. So we pretty well flattened out federal government spending at about $3.5 [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1461.52s)]
*  trillion for five or six or seven years. And then the last couple years of the Obama administration [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1466.48s)]
*  started creeping up. And then under Trump, it went from about $4 trillion to $4.1 to $4.4. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1471.6799999999998s)]
*  And then it went to $6.5. And we've never looked back. And the analogy I use there is I don't know [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1477.12s)]
*  of an American family, if they had an illness and they had to borrow $50,000 to pay for the medical [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1483.6799999999998s)]
*  bills, if that family member got well, you wouldn't keep borrowing $50,000 and spending that level. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1489.12s)]
*  But that's exactly what we've done. And like nobody, other than, you know, I'm the first [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1495.04s)]
*  guy who wrote the Wall Street Journal article about we really need to return to pre-pandemic levels. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1501.04s)]
*  It doesn't seem radical. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1506.0s)]
*  And I've laid out options, you know, Clinton, Obama, Trump. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1508.16s)]
*  COVID pandemic. This was just like a couple years ago. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1511.12s)]
*  So I mean, what Biden should have done, we overspent in 2020. And we first were talking [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1513.76s)]
*  about that CARES Act, it was like $750 billion, which I knew we had to do something fast and [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1520.8s)]
*  massive so markets wouldn't collapse. But within like a week or two, that went up to like $2.2 [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1525.36s)]
*  trillion. We sent out direct payment checks to 166 million Americans three times, way late, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1530.16s)]
*  way after unemployment had already returned from the 25 million person high, again, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1540.72s)]
*  25 million people unemployed when normally you're at five or six. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1545.92s)]
*  We sent out direct payment checks to 166 million Americans three times. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1550.0800000000002s)]
*  So we way overspent even in 2020. So you had trillions of dollars sloshing around the economy [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1554.8000000000002s)]
*  as you come into 2021. The economy is coming roaring back because you have all this pent up [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1560.72s)]
*  demand and all these dollars sloshing around. The last thing you should have done is add more fuel [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1565.3600000000001s)]
*  to the fire. That's what Biden Democrats did. Again, on average, $1.9 trillion of deficit spending [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1570.0800000000002s)]
*  over the next four years. We never came down off of that $6.5 trillion, you know, a little bit [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1578.4s)]
*  6.2, 6.3, but, you know, then started going back up again. And that's really the moment that's when [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1583.84s)]
*  a bass boat suddenly cost $100,000 or your car cost 90,000, you know, brand new Suburbans, 80 [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1588.9599999999998s)]
*  grand or whatever. That's when the country became obviously unaffordable, I think, unless I'm [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1594.8s)]
*  Mr. Republicans. Or your meal deal at McDonald's all of a sudden jumped from five to 10 bucks. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1599.76s)]
*  Go, when did that happen? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1603.68s)]
*  Yeah. I don't understand why there's no will to fix that. I mean, that seems like pretty basic [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1606.48s)]
*  macroeconomics in the Congress. Nobody's- I haven't heard McConnell say this, but I've [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1615.8400000000001s)]
*  heard the quote attributed to him. And this is one thing I agree with him on. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1620.48s)]
*  Show me one member of Congress who ever lost because they spent too much money. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1625.2s)]
*  Yeah. There just isn't public pressure. There's not public awareness. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1628.64s)]
*  We don't educate our young people. We don't- the news media doesn't connect the dots. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1633.2s)]
*  Why people can't afford things is because of massive deficit spending, which sparked [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1639.04s)]
*  40-year high inflation, devalued the dollar. I mean, to me, it's pretty obvious, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1643.52s)]
*  but normal Americans, they just get all surly about it. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1647.44s)]
*  So, okay. Well, then let's meditate for a moment on the consequences of it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1650.16s)]
*  I asked, what happens when there's a debt crisis? Why haven't we had one yet? You said, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1654.32s)]
*  we probably should have had one. I don't know why we haven't, but we're going to get one if [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1658.48s)]
*  we keep doing this. I said, what will the effect of that be? You said massive instability in the [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1661.36s)]
*  society. What do you mean? Like, what will that look like? Maybe it would awaken people [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1666.0s)]
*  to the threat if they knew what would happen in a debt crisis. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1672.0s)]
*  Well, so if you're living on different transfer payments or different types of welfare benefits, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1675.84s)]
*  you may not get those. You can't borrow more money, so you're going to have to take what [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1682.32s)]
*  money we spend on other government programs and we'll have to service our debt. You have to pay [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1687.76s)]
*  it off, unless we want to go into full default. And that's where you just say to Japan and China [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1691.68s)]
*  and Germany and everyone else who's bought those bonds, like, we're not paying. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1697.44s)]
*  Yeah. Which means you'll never float more debt. So you can't, you know, other than print more money, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1700.72s)]
*  which then creates even more hyperinflation. So now people can't afford anything. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1708.0s)]
*  I mean, has anyone ever defaulted, any country ever defaulted on debt and just said, we're not [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1712.4s)]
*  paying, come and get it? Oh, I'm sure they have. I'm not. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1716.24s)]
*  That's not common. I think it happens enough. But what always happens is, you know, countries like [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1719.36s)]
*  US go in there and we help them restructure their debt. I think that's happened numerous times. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1725.44s)]
*  But no one's going to come and help us restructure our debt. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1731.68s)]
*  Nobody can. Again, we will lose our position of the World's Reserve currency and we'll [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1734.56s)]
*  lose our ability to print dollars that people accept. I mean, it's a marvelous thing that we [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1739.04s)]
*  just print dollars, we can send them overseas and people will produce products and ship them over [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1745.44s)]
*  here. High quality products are pretty low cost. I think it's one of the reasons we've been able to [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1750.16s)]
*  keep inflation in check, producing all these massive deficits over the last couple of decades [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1754.0800000000002s)]
*  is we do import a lot of products. You know, we've got billions of people either un or [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1758.96s)]
*  underemployed around the world. We provide the capital, you know, they produce the factories, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1764.16s)]
*  they produce the goods. And then we, we just give them paper. It's fiat currency. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1768.96s)]
*  We print it, we keep printing it and it's been working out pretty well. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1775.52s)]
*  At some point in time that that gravy train might stop. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1778.8s)]
*  And then, I mean, then you have like a total collapse of the current system. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1782.4s)]
*  Yeah. Again, I can't predict, I'm trying to avoid it. It'll be painful. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1787.2s)]
*  Who really suffers are people at the lower end of the income spectrum that have no safety net. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1795.6000000000001s)]
*  They don't have any kind of hard assets that will inflate with inflation. They're just [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1801.2s)]
*  be destitute. A lot of them. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1805.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. In a country that has no kind of organizing [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1808.48s)]
*  principle or national identity where people are not as united as they were in 1929. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1813.1200000000001s)]
*  I had my comm staff put together a video. I asked them to find all these Republican leaders that [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1818.3200000000002s)]
*  have, you know, talked about balancing the budget. You know, we have a spending problem. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1824.24s)]
*  Starts out with the president Trump saying in the state of the union, I'm going to do something we [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1829.2s)]
*  haven't done in 24 years, balance federal budget. Then every Republican leader, some form of, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1833.52s)]
*  we don't have a revenue problem. We have a spending problem. In those clips, we have Elon [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1840.24s)]
*  Musk saying, if we don't fix this, there won't be money left over for anything. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1844.56s)]
*  And I think that's a pretty accurate statement. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1850.8799999999999s)]
*  So how many people can you really trust? Well, if you think about it, probably not that many. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1852.8s)]
*  Let's say you've got 20,000 Instagram followers. How many of them would show up at your house to [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1856.96s)]
*  help you if you had a crisis? Maybe about eight. That's a high number. The same is true on the [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1861.84s)]
*  internet. Who do you trust with your private information? That question has never been more [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1867.4399999999998s)]
*  relevant. Data brokers record every single detail of everything you do online. Then they sell your [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1871.36s)]
*  digital profile to scammers and invasive advertisers to make a living off of harassing you. If you're [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1876.9599999999998s)]
*  getting harassed, that's why. Probably are. Express VPN can end this cycle. Express VPN is a very [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1882.08s)]

*  Because we're not serious about returning to a reasonable pre-pandemic global spending. We've [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1938.3999999999999s)]
*  picked a number out of the air, 1.5 trillion. It's totally out of context. It's not really related [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1942.0s)]
*  to the moment. It's missing the moment. Can I ask you, who came up with that number? Whose lie is that? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1947.68s)]
*  I think my best guess is conservatives in the house, who I love, didn't want to be blamed if [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1961.44s)]
*  this thing failed. They said, well, listen, in order for us to accept a $5 trillion increase in [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1968.0s)]
*  the debt ceiling, we've got to get at least $1.5 trillion in savings, spending cuts. I don't think [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1974.16s)]
*  they were looking at the big picture. I think they just pulled a big... I criticized them at the time [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1980.32s)]
*  privately. I said, listen, you set the bar way too low, you guys. This is completely inadequate. They [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1985.92s)]
*  set the bar way too low that it should have been easy to meet it, quite honestly. But even that was [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1991.04s)]
*  difficult because they didn't go through what I would consider the right kind of process. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=1996.72s)]
*  So maybe we can shift in terms of what we have to do, what I'm trying to accomplish here and [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2002.56s)]
*  my digging my heels in. Dozier's kind of shown us what we can do here. We've never had a process [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2007.3600000000001s)]
*  to control spending in the federal government. We don't have a balanced budget requirement. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2014.64s)]
*  I didn't realize this, just found out. Do you know they established the appropriation committees [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2018.56s)]
*  because the authorizing committees were big spenders. So the appropriation committees [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2023.68s)]
*  were supposed to be the control on the big spenders. Well, that didn't work. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2028.0800000000002s)]
*  The Budget Control Act of 1974 didn't work. Simpson-Bowles didn't work. The Budget Control [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2032.16s)]
*  Act didn't work. It did for three years, but then we weaseled our way around it. So what process [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2037.44s)]
*  could possibly work to control spending? Well, first of all, you have to know the numbers. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2042.64s)]
*  You have to understand what a deep hole we're in and have a commitment to address it. But Dozier's [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2048.4s)]
*  pretty well shown us how to do it. Now I come from the private sector. I think we probably spent more [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2055.76s)]
*  time either analyzing my department head budgets or my own overall company budget than Congress in [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2060.56s)]
*  total spends analyzing the $7,000 billion budget of the federal government. So Dozier's shown us if you [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2067.92s)]
*  go line by line, contract by contract, you will discover and uncover spending that if the American [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2075.6s)]
*  public saw they'd be outraged by it. If you eliminated it, my guess is most Americans wouldn't [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2083.52s)]
*  even know it's eliminated. But the only people that would know would be the grifters who have [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2090.0s)]
*  been sucking down the waste, fraud and abuse. So you have to go step by step. So that's why [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2095.36s)]
*  I've always been supportive of a multiple step reconciliation process here. I was always recommending [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2100.56s)]
*  three steps. First step, give President Trump the funding on the border, defense, bank $850 billion [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2105.52s)]
*  of real savings not make believe, you know, now. And Lindsey Graham agreed to this 85 and a half [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2113.28s)]
*  billion dollars each year for four years to pay for the four years worth of spending. And then [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2118.8s)]
*  extend that out 10 years, that gives you 850. That's more than half of what the house budget [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2126.08s)]
*  reconciliation supposedly gives us. Second step, I would just extend current tax law. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2130.48s)]
*  If we would have been smart enough in 2017 had something like Chairman Crapo who really came up [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2136.0s)]
*  with this idea of let's just use current policy for taxes, then we can make this stuff permanent. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2140.64s)]
*  You should never pass on my mind a tax tax law that automatically expires just creates all these [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2145.6800000000003s)]
*  fiscal cliffs and puts all kinds of uncertainty in the economy. Why do they do that? Because we, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2152.08s)]
*  so this gets in real budget wonkery, but for spending to score it, you use current policy, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2159.36s)]
*  which means if a spending program ends, if you want to extend it, you just you score it based on [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2164.7999999999997s)]
*  what was going to be extended anyway, so it doesn't cost anything. For taxes, though, we use current [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2171.2799999999997s)]
*  law. So if the tax cuts are ending, and you want to extend them, well, you're scoring down the fact [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2176.56s)]
*  that they are going to end. So now to extend them is going to be a trillion dollar score. So then [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2183.36s)]
*  you got to pay for it. It's hard to pay for it. And so that's how it was all scored back in 2017, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2187.76s)]
*  where if we would just use current policy, if we use current policy now, we just extend current [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2192.6400000000003s)]
*  tax law and there's no score. So that's really what we're doing now. But we have to recognize [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2198.88s)]
*  when you're comparing to the CBO budget, CBO budgets is assuming it does taxes do increase, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2204.4s)]
*  and bring in about another $4 trillion worth of revenue. So that's why I say the $22 trillion [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2211.1200000000003s)]
*  in projected deficits is probably a rosy scenario. I mean, it seems like the core problems are just [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2215.12s)]
*  so familiar. One is short term thinking. And the second is the misplaced belief that you can see [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2221.92s)]
*  what the future will be. And both of those are like, silly and unwise. Maybe are we bumping up [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2227.68s)]
*  against the inherent limits of the system? Well, I would say we're missing the focusing on the right [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2234.16s)]
*  thing. We had to focus on spending. And the reason I say that is spending is pretty certain. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2242.88s)]
*  Again, who knows what revenue we're going to bring in. It's hard to predict spending. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2251.04s)]
*  That's that's pretty easy to predict what that's going to be. Plus, I personally voted for President [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2256.1600000000003s)]
*  Trump, because I wanted him to defeat the deep state. Yeah. You don't defeat the deep state by [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2263.12s)]
*  continuing to fund it at Biden's levels. Yeah, I know. So again, when you start talking about [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2268.56s)]
*  controlling the deficit, well, you control the deficit by tariff revenue or selling the gold card. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2273.68s)]
*  That keeps funding the deep state. You have to focus on spending and we've we've just gone through [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2279.04s)]
*  an unprecedented level of increased spending. Other than World War Two. Just quick aside on that. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2286.96s)]
*  We entered World War Two spending 11.7 percent of our economy of GDP on federal government. 11.7. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2293.12s)]
*  That got ramped up to 41 percent during the war. But by 1948, because we had responsible leaders, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2300.48s)]
*  you know, the greatest generation that actually went down to 11.4 percent of GDP. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2306.16s)]
*  And we returned to pre-war level. We had a massive recession, too. I mean, the, you know, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2310.56s)]
*  the war is over. Let's return to a reasonable pre-war level spending. We didn't do that during [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2315.68s)]
*  the pandemic. And that's what we have to do. You have to focus on doing it. It's such a reasonable [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2320.72s)]
*  thing to do. It should have been done in 2021. We didn't do it for four years. But now we're just [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2325.3599999999997s)]
*  pretty well accepting that. We're accepting the fact that Obamacare, now called Medicaid expansion, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2330.24s)]
*  is putting at risk Medicare for the truly vulnerable. Even though we all ran on repealing [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2335.8399999999997s)]
*  or replacing that and obviously failed in the first Trump term. But now we're all OK with it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2340.56s)]
*  Now we're not going to touch that because they renamed it. Are you kidding me? Well, this is [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2345.04s)]
*  but this is how it works. Like in 20 years, they'll be like, well, of course you have to [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2350.3199999999997s)]
*  protect trans kids. You know, what seems crazy at first becomes accepted and then it becomes [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2353.2799999999997s)]
*  the hill to die on. It's just like your expectations change. Right. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2359.04s)]
*  So again, I'm trying to force the discussion over the real numbers. OK. And again, 1.5 trillion [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2365.2s)]
*  in abstract seems like a lot, but we've really ramped up from 2019 to this year. That's over [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2374.0s)]
*  10 years. That's 29 trillion dollars of increased spending over 10 years. 29 trillion. And we're [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2382.96s)]
*  talking about cutting out 1.5 of that. Yeah, it's a joke. It's a joke because people don't [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2388.7999999999997s)]
*  want to cut it out. And so I guess that's my question. You said that the problem with [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2394.56s)]
*  democracy is once the majority figures out they can just steal money, then, you know, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2398.64s)]
*  then you're just like headed to the cliff and there's no pulling back. Are we there? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2404.0s)]
*  Well, again, they're not stealing it. They just don't realize that how it's financed is by printing [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2407.04s)]
*  money and they can't afford things. If you're taking other people's money, I mean, they're [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2412.0s)]
*  going to be called theft. Yeah, they try and tax it, but we're not taxing anywhere near enough. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2416.4s)]
*  Right. No. Right. So we're going to have to borrow 2.2 trillion dollars for the next 10 years [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2421.68s)]
*  every year. 2.2 at least. But that's effectively a tax because it devalues the money in your [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2426.96s)]
*  pockets. You're basically paying 10 bucks for a Big Mac and a Coke. Inflation is a silent tax. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2430.88s)]
*  Yeah. It's really nasty. Do you have any hope? I'm not the world's greatest optimist. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2436.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, how can you be? I fear we've passed the point of no return. The reason I'm [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2444.56s)]
*  digging my heels and Tucker, I don't want to. I bet you don't. I really don't. I mean, I'm not [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2451.52s)]
*  looking for it. Listen, I love what President Trump is doing. He's such a unique individual, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2456.16s)]
*  unique political figure, unique president. He is doing things that only he would do. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2463.2s)]
*  Nobody else would do it. It's things that have to be done. Okay. So I'm so supportive of most of [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2468.7999999999997s)]
*  what he's doing. But this is a once in a lifetime opportunity here. We've never had such an [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2475.7599999999998s)]
*  unprecedented level of spending. Returning to a reasonable level is just so common sense and not [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2483.2s)]
*  that hard. It's not going to be easy. But what I've done in laying out those pre-pandemic options, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2489.52s)]
*  go back to Bill Clinton, 1998, when we actually had a surplus for the first time in 1969. I don't [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2496.7999999999997s)]
*  think we spent too little in 1969 or 1998. Obama in 2014 or Trump in 2019. There are three options. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2501.68s)]
*  Leave Social Security, Medicare and interest as they are. Spend what you need to spend. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2510.08s)]
*  But for all the other outlays, you just increase them based on population growth and inflation. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2514.48s)]
*  A very reasonable control, right? You end up somewhere between 5.5 and 6.5 trillion. Now, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2519.44s)]
*  I would go back to Clinton recognizing that 9-11 happened after that. So you probably have to plus [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2526.08s)]
*  up defense. Although I'd like to hone how we spend our defense dollars. I think we talked about that [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2531.36s)]
*  earlier. I don't think we spend them well. Somewhere between 5.5 and 6.5 trillion dollars. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2536.88s)]
*  And then I printed out the budgets, a couple thousand lines. And then go through those budgets [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2543.44s)]
*  line by line and just ask the question, well, this is what Clinton was spending, fully inflated. Why [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2549.44s)]
*  are we spending this much more? Or this is what Obama spent? Or Trump? Why is it so much more? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2555.92s)]
*  Explain yourself. In business, this would be simple. I'd tell my manager that I said you could [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2562.4s)]
*  increase your budgets based on inflation, the number of customers you serve. Your 10% above that, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2569.2000000000003s)]
*  cut it. I don't care how you do it, just do it. Get back down to that level. To do it is so it [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2574.2400000000002s)]
*  doesn't harm our business, so it doesn't harm people's lives, but just do it. Because what we [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2580.96s)]
*  were spending 1998, 2014, 2019, I think it's probably pretty adequate. And by the way, if you [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2584.88s)]
*  go through it line by line, there'll be lines that I think you look at, scratch your head and go, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2590.96s)]
*  we probably shouldn't be spending anything on that. I think Doge has taught us that. So again, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2595.92s)]
*  Trump, and again, I think that was brilliant, what Trump and Elon did with Doge. But we haven't [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2601.36s)]
*  realized those savings yet. I think we stopped spending on contracts, but unless we send up [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2607.44s)]
*  and pass a rescission package on the discretionary end, and unless we take whatever they discovered [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2612.56s)]
*  and mandatory and eliminate that through the reconciliation process, those monies will just [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2617.6s)]
*  be sitting out there unobligated and some Democrat Congress and some Democrat president will spend [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2624.16s)]
*  it without even having to appropriate it. Can I ask about the defense budget? So it's [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2629.44s)]
*  in the neighborhood of a trillion dollars. We face no invasion threat, we never have. We're separated [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2635.2799999999997s)]
*  from the rest of the world by two large oceans. Our standing force is not that huge, actually. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2642.16s)]
*  It's not like all that money is going to pay for soldiers and Marines and airmen. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2647.44s)]
*  Why are we spending that much on defense? We haven't won a war in 80 years. So like, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2653.52s)]
*  I know that all Republicans are required to take the Liz Cheney position, that's just great. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2659.12s)]
*  Defense spending is just by its nature inherently good. But what is that? What's all that money going [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2664.08s)]
*  to exactly? We did not heed Eisenhower's warning. I think the military industrial complex has way [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2670.16s)]
*  too much power. I would love and we should do this is we should go back, at least as far back as [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2678.72s)]
*  Vietnam, and analyze each one of these foreign entanglements, each of these foreign wars, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2685.52s)]
*  and ask ourselves and gather some basic information. First, what was our goal going in? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2691.8399999999997s)]
*  Secondly, what did it cost in human life, ours, and our adversary, our enemies? What did it cost in terms of dollars? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2697.84s)]
*  And then the final question is, did we accomplish the objective? I think if you do that, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2708.8s)]
*  and I hate to say this because it's true, I mean, this is, we're filming this on Memorial Day, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2715.76s)]
*  the finest among us. People who love this country, who step up the plate willing to serve and [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2721.6800000000003s)]
*  sacrifice more than a million have paid the ultimate price. So I don't even like saying this, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2726.96s)]
*  but the fact of the matter is, if you did that kind of analysis, you wouldn't walk away very satisfied. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2733.12s)]
*  Well, but doesn't our respect for the men who died in military service require us to do that? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2739.2000000000003s)]
*  I think it does. So if you would, to do that, I mean, I was just recently in Hanoi a couple years ago. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2744.8s)]
*  What wonderful people. They love Americans. I mean, after even what they love America, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2752.4s)]
*  because they're entrepreneur, they're hardworking, they want, like most people in the world, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2759.44s)]
*  they want what we have. They respect the values of America, the principles of freedom, individual [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2763.5200000000004s)]
*  liberty. Okay. We never should have been to war with them. We never should have bombed those people. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2770.48s)]
*  But followed all the way through Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria. I mean, so, I mean, what have we [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2776.0s)]
*  accomplished with the Ukraine war right now? We have actually solidified the relationship between [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2785.04s)]
*  Russia and China and North Korea and Iran. Yes. That's completely opposite of what our goals [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2791.44s)]
*  ought to be. So it's just not working. I mean, we have not accomplished these goals. They've been [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2798.0s)]
*  miserable failures. How many people died in Iraq based on that false intelligence? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2802.56s)]
*  The best book I read on Afghanistan is written by special ops folks. They basically made the [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2809.2799999999997s)]
*  point that we'd pretty well accomplish what we need to accomplish in Afghanistan before Tommy [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2815.12s)]
*  Frank ever put a boot on the ground. You know, we said, hey, listen, you guys harbored Al Qaeda. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2820.0s)]
*  Don't do it anymore. Kind of punish the Taliban. And that's probably where we should have left [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2825.6s)]
*  that. How many Americans lost their lives? How many, you know, Afghanistan citizens lost [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2831.12s)]
*  their lives? What did that cost? It's almost incalculable. So a new report, which you may not [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2838.24s)]
*  have seen because it was suppressed, shows the abortion pill is 10 times more dangerous [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2843.52s)]
*  than the FDA claims. Not just dangerous to the baby that it kills, but to the women who take it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2849.6s)]
*  11% of women who take the pill experience quote, serious adverse effects. Why is it still on the [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2854.0s)]
*  market? Huh. Because it's abortion related and our leaders love abortion. It'd be easy to turn [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2860.48s)]
*  that figure into a rant about abortion, but there's another angle to this debate that's not talked [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2866.48s)]
*  about enough. And that's what a blessing babies are. People scoff about children like they're some [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2872.2400000000002s)]
*  kind of plague, but in reality, the exact opposite is true. On your deathbed, you will care only about [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2878.48s)]
*  your children. They are a gift unlike any other gift. They are the supreme gift. Our friends at [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2883.2s)]
*  Preborn understand this and they're working around the clock to save as many unborn lives [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2889.28s)]
*  as they can. Their ultrasound helps guide thousands of future mothers to choose life through [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2892.88s)]
*  knowledge. And that's possible because people like you support them. To help simply dial pound 250, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2897.84s)]
*  say the keyword baby. That's pound 250, the word baby, or visit preborn.com slash Tucker. We are [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2904.88s)]
*  proud to partner with Preborn. Well, given all of that, and given that no one has ever been punished, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2913.36s)]
*  no high ranking military officer I'm aware of has ever been punished for any of these failures. The [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2922.48s)]
*  withdrawal from Afghanistan was humiliating and costly and it was just a disaster in every way. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2927.04s)]
*  And the only guy who's punished is Stu Schiller, who's a Marine officer who points out that it [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2933.2000000000003s)]
*  wasn't a success, but the architects were rewarded. So given all of that, why are we [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2937.84s)]
*  sending these people even more money? Again, it's the military industrial complex. And [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2944.0s)]
*  there's some just basic metrics people use, like percentage GDP spending on defense, where [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2952.0s)]
*  we're kind of a low level and we should be, you know, we should be, I mean, we've got right now, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2958.88s)]
*  you know, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, McConnell, they want to dedicate 5%. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2962.7200000000003s)]
*  GDP to defense. So where are you going to get that money? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2967.92s)]
*  Yeah, I realize we're kind of down to historic low levels, but it's still a trillion dollars. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2971.84s)]
*  Where are we spending it? That's why I would love to see somebody like Eric Prince, who wrote an [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2975.6800000000003s)]
*  excellent article, Too Big to Win, become defense secretary and really take a look at how are we [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2981.04s)]
*  fighting these wars? What do we need to do to defend America? Somebody said to me the other [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2987.76s)]
*  day, I was talking to an informed person about this grousing about it. Like if you don't want [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2994.8s)]
*  a war for 80 years, why does your budget keep expanding? And this person said, the real reason [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=2998.8s)]
*  is America's industrial base is overwhelmingly military now. So actually, the only real thing [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3004.6400000000003s)]
*  we make are weapons. And so that's what that money does. I don't think that's actually true. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3011.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, there's certainly, again, you still have that industrial base. You know, you spend [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3016.6400000000003s)]
*  a trillion dollars out of a $28 trillion economy, $29 trillion economy. It's a pretty good chunk, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3021.28s)]
*  but it's not the majority of it. We make a lot of stuff. I think that's kind of a mistaken [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3026.6400000000003s)]
*  notion as well. Industrial production continues to rise here. Oh, yeah, we don't have, again, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3032.88s)]
*  we become more and more productive. That's a good thing. Again, right now, we don't have enough [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3039.6000000000004s)]
*  workers to be manufacturing a whole lot more stuff. I mean, the last thing we should be doing [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3044.4s)]
*  is trying to attract high labor content product back to the U.S. We just don't have enough people [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3048.56s)]
*  to do it. Interesting. So that's probably like a Raytheon talking point then. I don't know. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3052.96s)]
*  I'm just putting the basic numbers. I mean, that's interesting. So what happens to this bill? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3061.04s)]
*  Well, again, what I'd like to do is split it in two parts. Do the, you know, quite honestly, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3065.36s)]
*  what has to be done now, and that is provide the funding. I think they're asking way too much. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3070.88s)]
*  I pointed this out with Kristi Noem. They're looking for $46 billion for the fence, right? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3076.56s)]
*  Or for the wall. Well, in the first Trump term, I can't remember the exact numbers. I think something [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3081.84s)]
*  485 miles. We spent $6.6 billion. So that's like $14.4 million a mile. Now they want $46 billion. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3086.48s)]
*  That's built over 3,000 miles. So I asked her, square that circle for me. And she really didn't. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3096.32s)]
*  She was actually saying they're projecting $12 million. I was willing to give her 14.4, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3104.08s)]
*  even though I was in Israel when I was chairman of Homeland Security. They built their very [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3107.92s)]
*  effective fence for less than $2 million a mile. But lay that aside. So provide border funding. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3111.92s)]
*  The price you have to pay for that is more defense spending. Bank. We'll save as we can. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3121.84s)]
*  Take the good work the house has done. Bank that savings. Extend current tax law. Take an automatic [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3127.84s)]
*  tax increase off the table. Provide that certainty to the economy. Bump up the debt ceiling for a [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3133.52s)]
*  year. To keep pressure on us to come back and then do the big beautiful bill. We'll consider [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3137.68s)]
*  President Trump's tax proposals. Listen, I'm all for no tax on cash tips. Can't collect it anyway. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3143.68s)]
*  So why even try? And that keeps currency circulating through the economy as well. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3152.08s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. I don't want to go to a government-backed digital security. So that's [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3156.32s)]
*  good. I mean the other tax proposals he promises to make in the campaign, they're not pro-growth. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3160.72s)]
*  They're just going to reduce revenue. No tax on overtime. I ran a continuous shift operation. I [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3166.72s)]
*  think the one time and a half or double time is more than enough incentive. We all live under a [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3173.12s)]
*  tax system. Income is income. Why would we increase the regulatory burden on people who administer [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3179.04s)]
*  payroll to cordon off some of the overtime to don't tax it? I mean just be paying the butt. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3184.7999999999997s)]
*  Why doesn't everyone just pay the same rate? I don't understand that. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3189.52s)]
*  And then everyone has skin in the game. Everyone has a better sense of what their government is [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3193.12s)]
*  spending and on what if it's coming out of here. And that suggests a kind of a quality under the [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3199.28s)]
*  law that would be sort of nice if everyone was held. And I mean nonprofits too. I think we [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3204.24s)]
*  should get rid of all nonprofits immediately. Why isn't Harvard's endowment paying taxes? Like what [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3208.32s)]
*  is this? Why not just the same rate for everybody? Labor, capital, same rate. One rate. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3212.72s)]
*  You can be a nonprofit by not making a profit. I've done that too. If you're a university, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3218.56s)]
*  a church, something like that, you bring in revenue, you spend it, you get kind of profit. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3225.2s)]
*  You're a nonprofit. So no, the other reason I wanted to split this into two parts is [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3228.3199999999997s)]
*  we need to take the time to go line by line, to do a doge impact on the entire budget, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3233.68s)]
*  to find the outrageous spending, eliminate what people won't even notice, but also [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3240.0s)]
*  to simplify and rationalize our tax system. We have a grotesquely complex tax system. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3244.64s)]
*  Everyone's out of compliance. Everybody's committing a felony unwittingly. Every single person. You, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3252.16s)]
*  me, every other American. So simplify it again using basic principles. Don't try and socially [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3256.16s)]
*  and economically engineer the tax code. We're terrible at it. You can't, you're not that smart. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3262.4s)]
*  So raise the revenue you need. Try not to do any economic or social harm. So that would imply a [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3267.12s)]
*  very simple tax system. They always say lower the rates, brown the base. But fair, I don't personally, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3273.76s)]
*  I've done well in this country. I don't mind having a progressive tax rate. I really don't. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3280.2400000000002s)]
*  Certainly exempting a certain amount of income so people can live without having to pay tax and [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3286.88s)]
*  stuff. But within those confines, keep it as absolutely simple as possible. Now, one thing [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3291.0400000000004s)]
*  I know, there's nothing simple about simplifying the tax code. I mean, everybody's got their [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3296.0s)]
*  little tax break. And you know, even right now, one of the reasons I'm not looking forward to this [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3300.7999999999997s)]
*  ordeal that's going to come about over the next couple of weeks as I dig my heels in is, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3306.64s)]
*  there are a lot of people that support President Trump and have supported me. They want [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3311.12s)]
*  no taxing over time. By the way, if all you live on is social security, the chance of you paying [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3314.7999999999997s)]
*  a dollar tax on that is almost infinitesimal. So we don't tax social security right now. But [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3322.16s)]
*  let's face it, if you have social security and you have income above that, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3327.76s)]
*  why should you exempt some of your income? I think us oldsters have stolen enough from [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3331.76s)]
*  younger generations. I mean, you see the wealth transfer. I used to have a chart on this, but the [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3338.4s)]
*  transfer of wealth from young to old over the decades, it's literally immoral. It's immoral. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3342.48s)]
*  So let's not exasperate that problem. It's disgusting. Again, if you can do something on [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3349.28s)]
*  tax, again, I don't think this is the point. I don't want to increase people's taxes, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3354.72s)]
*  but I don't think this is a point in time to be cutting taxes that aren't incentivizing growth. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3358.8799999999997s)]
*  And again, I'd rather not be incentivizing, you know, again, trying to use the tax code to try and [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3364.56s)]
*  come up with some way to incentivize growth. Just keep it simple, uncomplicated, rational. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3370.08s)]
*  Income is income. Basic principles like wherewithal to pay. I mean, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3375.2799999999997s)]
*  design approach all of these things with principles. The big problem in the house, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3378.72s)]
*  what was the goal there? I would think the goal of this Republican budget reconciliation would be [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3384.96s)]
*  to reduce the deficits. It seems like in the house, the only goal was to pass one big, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3390.48s)]
*  beautiful bill by Memorial Day. Great. You achieved your goal, but you didn't [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3395.84s)]
*  solve our fiscal situation. Didn't even come close. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3402.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not impressed by the people managing this in the house, I'm just going to say. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3404.16s)]
*  So I'm not surprised, but it of course needs the Senate as well. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3410.72s)]
*  Well, it needs presidential leadership. And he needs to get behind fixing this problem. Now, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3415.52s)]
*  he said in the State of the Union, he's going to balance a budget. Fine. But I know in his mind, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3421.92s)]
*  he thinks he's going to balance a budget with tariff revenue. I'm sorry, tariffs are a tax. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3427.2799999999997s)]
*  We're not quite sure who pays them. Whereas the foreign companies, the foreign countries, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3432.96s)]
*  the US consumer, again, the instance of tax is never particularly certain, but tariffs raise [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3439.04s)]
*  the cost of goods. For what? Again, there's no doubt there's certain products, high-end [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3445.12s)]
*  semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, rare earth minerals. We got to be basic in those. We have [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3454.8s)]
*  to produce these here just from standpoint of national security. Is there a better way of [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3459.76s)]
*  doing that than just generalized increasing of a tax, which is what a tariff is? I would argue [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3463.6800000000003s)]
*  there probably is. How about this? We just give you a tax holiday for five or ten years. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3468.88s)]
*  Again, you've got a high-end semiconductor plant in a different country. We're not collecting the [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3477.0400000000004s)]
*  tax on it anyway. It's no skin off our, you know what, to just come on over here, produce that here. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3480.48s)]
*  We'll just give you a ten-year tax. Talk to the people who are going to invest in it. What's it [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3486.48s)]
*  going to take? How long a tax holiday? What's reasonable? You'll incentivize it that way, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3489.84s)]
*  but don't incentivize it by mucking up our tax code or, I'd say even worse, things like the [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3495.04s)]
*  CHIPS Act where you pay money to grifters that don't really fulfill their end of the bargain. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3500.4s)]
*  We're just not good at doing these things. The free market's not perfect, but it is the most [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3509.84s)]
*  efficient allocator of capital. You provide somebody a tax holiday and I think you can [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3514.88s)]
*  bring those things back here pretty good. Plus, permitting reform. If you want to do precursor [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3521.44s)]
*  chemicals for pharmaceuticals, you've got to permit the refineries. You've got to permit the [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3526.48s)]
*  mines if you're going to mine rare minerals and if you're going to refine those things. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3532.1600000000003s)]
*  Again, we have to look at this, but it requires presidential leadership to go make the case, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3536.88s)]
*  the logical case. That, from my standpoint in terms of me digging my heels in, I'm a reasonable [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3542.88s)]
*  guy, but you're not going to sell me just by saying, you've got to pass the one big beautiful [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3550.08s)]
*  bill. I'm tired of the rhetoric. I'm not prone to slogans. It's like, lay out the case. If you can [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3554.56s)]
*  lay out the case that we are promoting growth and this is what the revenue is going to be and this [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3561.12s)]
*  is how we actually shrink the deficit and this is how we avoid a debt crisis, I want to be on board. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3565.84s)]
*  I want to see this president succeed. How many of your colleagues in the Senate have your position [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3570.8s)]
*  on this? Well, it's interesting. There's a fair number that are coalescing around the number and [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3574.96s)]
*  I've never really, I've laid out options, but I've never dug my heels in on a number for a [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3581.52s)]
*  pre-pandemic level spending. But I've laid it out, I think logically enough, most people are, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3586.1600000000003s)]
*  there's a pretty big group say that it should be no more than $6.5 trillion in the next fiscal year. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3591.1200000000003s)]
*  So that implies about a $800 billion difference between what we're expected to spend, which would [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3596.56s)]
*  be about $8 trillion of spending reduction over 10 years. It's a long ways from the $1.5 trillion. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3602.2400000000002s)]
*  Again, what I've always said is I need a commitment to return to a reasonable pre-pandemic [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3608.8s)]
*  level spending, realizing we have to get the votes, but maybe even more importantly, a process [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3612.96s)]
*  to achieve and maintain it. And that's that line by do the work, but it'll take time to do the work. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3620.0s)]
*  But we need a commitment. I can't do it. I don't have access to all the information we really need. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3627.0400000000004s)]
*  And why I proposed in one of my Wall Street Journal columns was a budget review panel [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3631.6000000000004s)]
*  made up of senators, house members, staff of the OMB, Office of Management and Budget. I mean, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3635.28s)]
*  those are the guys that know their stuff. And then have this as a review panel and bring up, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3641.36s)]
*  just like in business, budget review meeting, bring up the department heads with their budget [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3646.64s)]
*  gurus and stuff and explain it. Go line by line. Again, why are you spending so much more than [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3652.24s)]
*  a fully inflated Bill Clinton level or Obama or Trump? I mean, explain yourself. Why should we [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3658.24s)]
*  be spending even a dime on this category right here? So you've got top lines within the federal [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3663.68s)]
*  government, more than 2000 lines. Under each one of those lines, there's probably hundreds of lines [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3669.8399999999997s)]
*  between all those. So you got a lot of work to do, but it doesn't get done. You could try and rush [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3676.0s)]
*  this thing through. And now by July 4th is what would be the goal for the Senate. So I want to [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3680.72s)]
*  break this up into two parts to give us the time to go through that budget line by line. Will you get it? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3685.28s)]
*  Right now, I think I've got at least four that will dig their heels in and say, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3693.68s)]
*  again, we want to see you succeed. We want to pass this. We want to pass something. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3698.16s)]
*  We'll pass what must be passed now. Again, we've already set this up in the Senate with our budget [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3702.24s)]
*  resolution to provide the defense and border funding plus $850 billion in savings. Tack that [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3707.68s)]
*  onto the House where we extend current tax law and increase the debt ceiling. By the way, that's going [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3714.24s)]
*  to be a massive amount. It should shock everybody what we're going to have to increase the debt [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3719.12s)]
*  ceiling for just to get us by another year. Probably $2 to $2.5 trillion because we have [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3724.0s)]
*  to refill the extraordinary measures that the buckets they've taken from to extend the debt [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3729.92s)]
*  ceiling. We're right now burning about a half a trillion dollars a quarter. So you're talking [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3734.64s)]
*  extending next year five quarters at half a trillion dollars, that's $2.5 trillion just to [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3742.32s)]
*  get us by into next year. That should shock everybody. That's my whole purpose here [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3749.36s)]
*  is we haven't talked about the numbers. We haven't put this in context of the big mess we're in, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3756.1600000000003s)]
*  the deep hole we've dug ourselves. I'm just going to force that debate. I'm not trying to be [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3763.6000000000004s)]
*  obstinate. I'll probably be accused of grandstanding. I'd rather not do this. I'd [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3769.28s)]
*  rather have the House having really succeeded and the President totally behind, again, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3774.0800000000004s)]
*  returning to pre-pandemic level spending, but somebody's got to do it. Since we launched ALB, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3778.7200000000003s)]
*  we've had four flavors, but we are proud to announce ALB has a brand new flavor, one of [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3782.96s)]
*  several we'll be rolling out over the next year or so, and it is Sweet Nectar. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3789.12s)]
*  I have personally tested this product two at a time, and it's excellent. Sweet Nectar, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3797.76s)]
*  the new flavor out from ALB, really, really good. You can order it in bulk by the palette if you [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3803.68s)]
*  want. I have strongly recommended Sweet Nectar. Stay tuned for more new flavors. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3808.48s)]
*  It's interesting if you pull back a little bit. As with the defense budget, you don't win a war [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3817.92s)]
*  for 80 years, but you keep getting more money. A primary driver of the deficits and the debt [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3822.48s)]
*  is healthcare spending. Is the country getting healthier? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3828.96s)]
*  No, we're getting sicker. Again, that's shifting gears into really the failure of our healthcare [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3832.48s)]
*  system, of establishment medicine, of pharmaceutical-driven medicine. They call it Rockefeller medicine. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3839.76s)]
*  This is where I've been so supportive. Why do they call it Rockefeller medicine? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3846.56s)]
*  He's really one that really pushed pharmaceutical drug companies way back when I don't understand [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3849.36s)]
*  the full history. But again, that's all petrochemical-based, chemistry-based, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3855.04s)]
*  and rather than really focusing on health, it's all, we've got a pill for this. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3860.4s)]
*  Here's an example. I think this is true, but there was a debate in terms of what caused heart disease. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3868.2400000000002s)]
*  Is it too much sugar? Is it cholesterol? From the pharmaceutical industry standpoint, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3876.0s)]
*  they had a drug to lower cholesterol. Statins. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3882.08s)]
*  So guess what they chose? Cholesterol. The winner. The winner because we've got a drug to manage [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3884.96s)]
*  that. Now, there are all kinds of emerging serious side effects of statins. One that I read about [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3892.96s)]
*  was sudden hearing loss. Guess who lost their hearing just like that? Me. Two weeks after I [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3902.64s)]
*  returned from Moscow, I just lost my hearing. Just like stepped out of the shower and I lost [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3910.72s)]
*  my hearing, my balance in an instant. Like all your hearing? In my right ear. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3915.9199999999996s)]
*  So you start researching all this. I mean, NIH reviewed me because it thought it might have been [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3923.9199999999996s)]
*  Havana syndrome. But as I got involved in the whole COVID and I got to meet all these doctors [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3929.9199999999996s)]
*  who had a second opinion that weren't going along with the narrative, that were, they had the courage [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3936.16s)]
*  and compassion to actually treat COVID patients that took seriously the vaccine injured. It just [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3940.24s)]
*  connects you to just alternate opinions, alternate thinking. And one of them laid out the listed [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3946.08s)]
*  side effects of statins and one of them was sudden hearing. A lot of people were thinking it could be [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3954.16s)]
*  a main driver of Alzheimer's. But again, they'll never admit it because that's a multi-billion [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3958.7999999999997s)]
*  dollar industry right there. Do you think it's possible that statins are responsible for dementia? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3964.24s)]
*  People are saying that. I don't know. I'm not a doctor, not a medical researcher, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3969.76s)]
*  but my eyes have been open. That's really scary right there. If that's true, that's it. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3973.28s)]
*  I mean, people are positing that. I will say since I took myself off statins, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3977.52s)]
*  I've had a number of health conditions that just improved as a result. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3984.32s)]
*  Seriously? Yeah. I was complaining for years, quite honestly. So they put me on statins when I [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3988.0s)]
*  went in for a CT scan and they saw calcium buildup on what they call the widow maker. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3993.6800000000003s)]
*  But that's external. I can always bust through the arterial wall and cause real problems. But I [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=3999.04s)]
*  had a heart catheterization a couple of years ago. I woke up from that and go, man, I wish my plumbing [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4005.6800000000003s)]
*  was as clean as yours. So I don't know, is it because I was on statins all those years? But [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4010.96s)]
*  I know I was going being treated because I was having pretty severe dizzy spells almost point [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4016.1600000000003s)]
*  of passing out frequently, going up a step or whatever. I took myself off statins under [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4021.12s)]
*  doctor's care. That's gone. I'll give you another one. This is very personal. This is strange I'm [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4027.76s)]
*  getting into this. It's a safe space. So I've always had acid reflux for years. And so I was [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4037.1200000000003s)]
*  on everything. Zantac and Prilosec and then Nexium, which by the way were great in terms of leaving [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4045.6000000000004s)]
*  symptoms but also have some pretty nasty side effects. So again, you know, reading these [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4051.92s)]
*  alternate opinions on stuff, hydroxychloric, no, hydrochloric acid has been known for decades to be [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4059.84s)]
*  a gestivate. The theory behind what causes acid reflux is you don't have enough stomach acid. You're [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4067.36s)]
*  not, you're not digesting the food properly. You're not providing the signal to the, I guess, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4075.12s)]
*  sphincter muscle, whatever that closes your stomach off from your esophagus. So what you do to [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4081.6s)]
*  solve it is you introduce more acid in the form of a natural vegetarian based product and that's [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4088.88s)]
*  called hydrochloric acid. So I take one tablet now before my evening meal. I miss it probably at [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4097.2s)]
*  least half the time. I don't have it anymore. So I don't take any of that stuff anymore. This [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4105.92s)]
*  worked far better. It's just completely natural. It's completely opposite of what all these other [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4112.0s)]
*  patented drugs do for you. So it's just, it's just HCL and they call it baiting or something like [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4119.12s)]
*  that, but it's just an over the counter supplement and it's worked great. I mean, you would think, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4126.959999999999s)]
*  given what you've- So I will get all kinds of guff for talking about this stuff, but it's just, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4133.44s)]
*  because that's what, that's what they do. This is the- [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4137.36s)]
*  Well, you just described your life improving and health improving and that's somehow a thought [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4142.08s)]
*  crime. Like how does that work? It will be because the pharmaceutical industrial complex, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4146.0s)]
*  again, it's all about drugs that can treat chronic illness, which is why you can't talk about these [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4151.68s)]
*  things, which is why they completely sabotaged the treatment of, early treatment of COVID [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4158.16s)]
*  using things like hydroxychloroquine and particularly ivermectin, which I heard story, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4164.4s)]
*  because yeah, I was at the tip of the spear. I got all kinds of people calling me, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4170.88s)]
*  what doctors treat this. And so I heard the amazing stories of recovery with ivermectin. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4175.52s)]
*  We will hold a hearing on this. There's one attorney that got called in to sue a hospital because [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4181.4400000000005s)]
*  somebody's loved one was in the hospital and they were begging them to use ivermectin. The hospital [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4188.56s)]
*  just refused. So this lawyer went in there and sued, was successful, saved that person's life. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4193.6s)]
*  So in the end, because he did this, I think he had something, this is a rough number, something [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4200.400000000001s)]
*  200 families that he went to court for to force the hospitals to use ivermectin or [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4204.5599999999995s)]
*  budessonide or some of these other drugs, right? He won about half the cases. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4212.24s)]
*  Of those hundred cases, I think he lost two or a couple of patients. Otherwise they all survived. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4217.839999999999s)]
*  Of the hundred cases he lost, they all died. Whoa. So you take a look at these hospital [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4224.32s)]
*  protocols. There's a great documentary, Vax 3, that really goes through this and just talks [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4231.92s)]
*  about the hospital protocols using remdesivir, which the nurses called run death. Death is near. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4237.6s)]
*  The antifouled she said this is the treatment, even though whatever study it was, they changed [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4243.2s)]
*  the endpoint from death to just days in hospital, which I don't think even that was true. The number [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4248.72s)]
*  of conflicts of the people reviewing that that were associated with Gilead, I mean, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4256.16s)]
*  the who recommended against using remdesivir and yet we still use it. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4260.639999999999s)]
*  You see what happened during COVID, thoroughly corrupt. And we just had our hearing on the [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4265.36s)]
*  signals on myocarditis, which they completely downplayed, hid for months on the COVID injection. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4271.599999999999s)]
*  So why are we giving any money to a system that not only fails to improve public health, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4279.68s)]
*  but actively conspires against it? I would say the [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4286.160000000001s)]
*  primary reason at this point in time is because in 1997, Clinton through regulation allowed [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4291.92s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies to advertise. And you look at those ads, you don't have any idea what [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4296.8s)]
*  those drugs do. But that's common around the world, right? Most countries allow that. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4302.400000000001s)]
*  Only America and New Zealand allow that. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4305.599999999999s)]
*  I knew the eyes. I know you did. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4308.719999999999s)]
*  Evoke that. So only the United States and New Zealand out of every country and planet Earth [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4310.32s)]
*  allow drug pharma companies to advertise. Right. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4315.919999999999s)]
*  On television. And so you take a look at those ads, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4319.12s)]
*  I have no idea what any of those drugs are treating other than they allow dogs to jump higher and [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4322.24s)]
*  people to play around the pool and make your wife hotter. Yeah. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4328.0s)]
*  I mean, they look wonderful. And then if you listen to the side effects, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4331.360000000001s)]
*  spoken, possible death, it's like, again, I sold plastic. I'm used to marketing. There is no way [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4337.360000000001s)]
*  anybody would spend a dollar, a dime on an ad for a product where you've got to list all the horrible [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4346.56s)]
*  side effects. Why do they do it? It's not to sell. Again, you don't know what the drug is for. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4353.04s)]
*  They're not selling those drugs. No, they are buying the narrative. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4357.280000000001s)]
*  I worked in the media my whole life. And that is what we saw during COVID. I mean, that's what [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4360.88s)]
*  completely opened up my eyes. They're paying NBC and Fox News and CNN and CBS and everybody else [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4367.44s)]
*  not to criticize the COVID shots. I ran in 2010 after I'd given a tea party speech and [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4372.4s)]
*  two things I said, which my campaign guy said, never say that again, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4378.08s)]
*  is I defended big oil and big pharma. So what am I the only guy that likes a gas station every [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4381.92s)]
*  corner of the town because I run it down to empty or am I the only one that wants a life-saving new [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4387.12s)]
*  drug? By the way, there are wonderful drugs. For sure. There are that we need, particularly in acute [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4393.04s)]
*  care. But we do need, and this is what, again, I give Bobby Kennedy and Trump so much credit for [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4399.76s)]
*  laying aside their political differences, joining an alliance to focus on a problem that they both [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4405.36s)]
*  agree that needs to be solved. And it's chronic illness. Bobby Kennedy says 75% of our healthcare [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4411.92s)]
*  spending is on chronic illness. And so I just laid out, you know, I had a chronic condition, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4416.08s)]
*  acid reflux, GERD, and kept treating with all these pharmaceuticals. They weren't cheap, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4422.16s)]
*  you know, prilocyte nexium. They're not cheap. Levee the symptoms, but didn't fix it. I go to [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4427.68s)]
*  something that just is far cheaper. I think works better. I don't even have to take it every day. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4434.4s)]
*  I think I've probably replenished the acid in my stomach, which declines with age. And just so, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4441.36s)]
*  I mean, every other day I take one, if I remember, as an evening meal, pretty well solve the condition. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4447.28s)]
*  I have cured a chronic, I'm not treating it anymore. I was treating it with prilocyte [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4454.08s)]
*  nexium. I've pretty well cured it. Now, I still take this because it's a digestive aid. It's like [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4458.719999999999s)]
*  eat the right stuff. Why can't, if Clinton allowed pharma to advertise, allowed pharma to buy the [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4464.48s)]
*  media, which they did, I can verify that since I worked there, why can't that be undone as easily? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4472.08s)]
*  Well, it can. You ought to use your influence with President Trump to make sure he supports Bobby if [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4478.24s)]
*  he decides to do that. But we should do that. And again, I'm a free market guy. I mean, I'm... [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4483.679999999999s)]
*  But we couldn't even have a debate about the most obvious things during COVID because the media [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4489.92s)]
*  wouldn't allow it. And again, I can verify that firsthand since I worked there. And you just [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4495.28s)]
*  couldn't, they did not want in any way to criticize pharma companies, period. So that's where it [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4501.36s)]
*  started. We're not criticizing these people, period. And it's because they pay all the bills. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4505.84s)]
*  So if you ended that, which you could do, I think, with a stroke of a pen, you could have [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4510.56s)]
*  informed consent again. People would have a chance to know what they were being prescribed [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4517.36s)]
*  and decide whether or not to take it, right? That would be the hope. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4522.08s)]
*  I had a public event and it was really based on your interview with Casey and Callie Means. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4528.24s)]
*  And so we put that together. Bobby Kennedy showed up and we had a bunch of social media influencers [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4535.28s)]
*  on nutrition. And one of the witnesses, specializing, he's a psychiatrist specializing [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4539.68s)]
*  in nutrition's impact on mental health, I think probably made the best little snippet of testimony, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4545.68s)]
*  said, you know, they don't want to know the root cause of chronic illness. Again, who's they? I [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4551.6s)]
*  remember you asked that too. What's that, Catherine Witt? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4560.64s)]
*  Oh, wonderful. Yeah, exactly. You asked her who are they? I ask that of myself all the time. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4566.48s)]
*  My guess is they attend Davos. Whoever they are, they're there. They're not invited to my house [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4575.2s)]
*  for dinner. But I thought that was a very interesting comment. They don't want to know [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4580.48s)]
*  the root cause. Because if they find out it is some pharmaceutical product or some [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4585.04s)]
*  pesticide or some herbicide or some toxin in our food, that's going to disrupt multi-billion [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4592.8s)]
*  dollar business models. And those businesses are fully engaged in lobbying. They're fully engaged [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4599.2s)]
*  in having captured our regulatory agencies. I'm talking about, listen, government is power, right? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4604.96s)]
*  That's a pretty good definition of government. It's power. And as Lord Acton's aptly stated, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4611.68s)]
*  power corrupts. And so what has happened over the decades is these businesses have a great [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4618.0s)]
*  deal of sympathy for them being over-regulated by big government, right? But they're smart, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4623.5199999999995s)]
*  especially the big ones. They got smart people there. So not only do they figure out how to [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4627.84s)]
*  survive with over-regulation, they learn how to capture it. And then they capture it for [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4631.44s)]
*  their benefit to the detriment of their competitors, particularly smaller competitors, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4639.12s)]
*  and detriment of the American public. And that is what has happened, I would say, across the board [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4644.48s)]
*  in government, whether it's pharmaceuticals, whether it's military-industrial complex, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4648.08s)]
*  whether it's our big food. That's in my mind, that's the hope. That's what I want to see Donald Trump [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4651.2s)]
*  defeat. And he first defeated by exposing it. People have to understand this is what's happened. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4657.759999999999s)]
*  But certainly what I learned, you learned, Bobby Kennedy learned during COVID, it is very difficult [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4664.16s)]
*  defeat back then what I called the COVID cartel. That is a powerful group of interests and they're [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4669.68s)]
*  not going away. Let's start with a really easy one. And those are the vaccine injured. So these [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4676.64s)]
*  would be American citizens who obeyed their government and took a shot that they were required [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4680.96s)]
*  to take on pain and punishment, and then were injured by or killed by that shot. They've [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4688.0s)]
*  received almost no attention. You're literally one of the only lawmakers who ever mentions them. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4695.84s)]
*  You've had a bunch of hearings, you know them personally. Describe the scale of the injury and [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4700.32s)]
*  death from the COVID shots, if you would. Well, just on VAERS alone, I think we're over 38,000 [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4705.6s)]
*  deaths associated with the COVID vaccine. VAERS is the federally created... Yeah, vaccine adverse [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4710.32s)]
*  event reporting system. Yes. So that's a government reporting system. Right. Now, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4717.4400000000005s)]
*  some conditions are mandatory to be reported, but they're still not. The two complaints about or [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4723.12s)]
*  hits on VAERS is it doesn't prove causation, but it also dramatically understates the number of [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4730.5599999999995s)]
*  adverse events because people just don't report them. Sometimes you don't connect the dots. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4736.72s)]
*  So on VAERS system, to date worldwide, there's over 38,000 deaths associated with the COVID vaccine. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4743.12s)]
*  And 24% of those to date either occur on the date of vaccination or within one or two days. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4750.0s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, I know someone who was killed by it. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4756.48s)]
*  We saw these athletes dropping like flies on the field. You saw newscasters just toppling over [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4760.16s)]
*  from their anchor chair. And like, that wasn't reported. You'd get it through social media. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4766.56s)]
*  You might have a local news story, but there's no national news media that hopped out and say, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4775.36s)]
*  what is happening here? No, because that wasn't real. It was all denied. Yeah. It was all denied. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4780.48s)]
*  A lot of 23 year old soccer players have heart conditions, it turns out. Yeah. Yeah. It's all [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4785.5199999999995s)]
*  that exercise they do. I don't know why I'm laughing. It's horrible. So 38,000 globally [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4790.639999999999s)]
*  just on VAERS. Is anyone keeping track of the injuries and the chronic illness caused by those [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4797.44s)]
*  shots? I think they're primarily calling it long COVID now. Okay. That's their excuse. And even [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4803.92s)]
*  those who are vaccine injured want to think it's just a long COVID. I mean, nobody wants to admit [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4810.72s)]
*  that they maybe should have taken a little more time, gotten a little more educated about this [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4817.68s)]
*  experimental COVID injection. They don't want to think there may be a ticking time bomb in terms [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4821.6s)]
*  of turbo cancers. But again, more and more evidence is coming out that in tumors, they find the spike [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4826.56s)]
*  protein, the spike protein as long as as well as the modified RNA. It's not true mRNA that does [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4832.24s)]
*  degrade very rapidly, circling the body for months, possibly years. Again, they find the spike protein [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4838.08s)]
*  in autopsy hearts in tumors. You know, we know from people like Kevin McKernan that there was [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4844.16s)]
*  DNA contamination. It can't integrate into the cell, could cause cancer. Again, there's so yeah, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4850.88s)]
*  I hate talking about it because I know 70 80% of Americans got vaccinated. They don't want to [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4857.6s)]
*  hear about it. No, no, no, they don't. They want to just move on. That's why it's so difficult to [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4862.56s)]
*  hold people accountable for this. Here's an easy way to do it. So if I sell any product, a food [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4866.96s)]
*  product, for example, and it turns out to kill people, get sued. Exactly. So only the vax makers [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4872.240000000001s)]
*  have this exemption granted to them by Congress, the shield. And I've never heard a real argument [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4880.160000000001s)]
*  for why they should maintain that or why Congress continues to protect them. Why? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4886.24s)]
*  But by the way, so I talked to Barbara, Barbara Lowe Fisher, who is the mom who really pushed that [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4891.44s)]
*  thing through that law itself does not provide liability. This is the 1986. Yeah, it was [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4895.679999999999s)]
*  regulations kind of the wink wink now now to get it passed that they implement, you know, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4903.44s)]
*  promulgated regulations actually provide that liability protection. Again, that it wasn't, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4908.48s)]
*  it wasn't just for the three vaccines, I think at the time they were on the schedule, it exempted [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4914.64s)]
*  all future vaccines, which has led to an explosion. Because again, the greatest risk, there's no [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4919.4400000000005s)]
*  downside. Yeah, I mean, just keep cranking these things out that they aren't tested in a true [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4926.320000000001s)]
*  people's placebo controlled trial. Sometimes the trial period is meagres, it is only last for [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4932.400000000001s)]
*  a week. It's just it's shocking. This is, you know, Aaron Seary testified at our hearing [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4940.08s)]
*  last week. And he's expert at all this in terms of the American public would be shocked at how little [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4946.639999999999s)]
*  testing these vaccines actually receive. But you have this, it's almost a religion around the [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4953.2s)]
*  safety and efficacy of vaccines. I mean, I understand that it's such an elegant solution, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4960.32s)]
*  isn't it? Just a 100% safe shot in the army, you never have to worry about that. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4964.64s)]
*  That's fine. Maybe there's just not true. Well, but let's say it is true, they're super safe. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4969.4400000000005s)]
*  Peter Hotez is like a legitimate physician. He's telling the truth. He's not deranged. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4973.6s)]
*  And okay, then prove it. Then hold them to the same standard that every other product that you buy, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4978.56s)]
*  certainly every product that's mandated by government is held to. And that's one that's [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4985.52s)]
*  backstopped by the courts, right? Tort law. Like I don't understand like why would there be this [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4989.44s)]
*  one thing that's exempt from a process that every other thing is subject to? Because, because there [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=4994.799999999999s)]
*  were so many injuries manifesting themselves before that law was passed, that those manufacturers [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5001.5199999999995s)]
*  can be sued out of existence. And again, the the religion faith that these vaccines are just so [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5008.16s)]
*  crucial. Even though you read a book like dissolving illusions, you realize the main reason most of these [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5014.0s)]
*  diseases were eradicated is because we no longer live in squalor. We have sewers. We have sanitation. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5019.12s)]
*  Right. Okay, so I mean, you see the chart coming down here, and then the vaccines [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5025.68s)]
*  start occurring here. And yeah, the tail goes out. And we, you know, vaccines may have eradicated [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5028.96s)]
*  some of these disease. I don't deny that. But the main thing is we, you know, we actually [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5032.8s)]
*  improve sanitation. And what we are ignoring now is treatment. And that came out with COVID. It's [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5039.2s)]
*  like, I mean, I couldn't, you know, the reason I got into this is I'm chairman Homeland Security. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5045.6s)]
*  I'm the only guy holding hearings on this stuff, because none of this stuff makes sense. So why are [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5050.88s)]
*  why are they just pillorying something like hydroxychloroquine? I mean, if it works, give it [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5055.280000000001s)]
*  a shot. I mean, what's the harm? It's incredibly safe. Ivermectin. But that was completely sabotaged, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5059.6s)]
*  all for the purpose of forcing this this injection, what they call the vaccine, on everybody's as a [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5068.08s)]
*  solution. Why don't we talk about treating disease, measles? Why aren't we focusing on treatment? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5074.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm telling these doctors, generally a very treatable disease, just about any disease can kill [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5081.280000000001s)]
*  you. Okay, but a lot of diseases can be treated, we ought to be focusing a lot more from my standpoint [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5086.240000000001s)]
*  on treatment, as opposed to loading up our children, our infants with dozens and dozens of doses, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5091.76s)]
*  and not even asking the question. So okay, have these been thoroughly tested? I mean, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5101.200000000001s)]
*  have we tested giving multiple vaccines at the same dose? I mean, every time you put a vaccine in [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5105.84s)]
*  somebody's arm, you're messing with their immune system. Why do we have all these autoimmune diseases [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5112.400000000001s)]
*  nowadays? You know, what is causing autism? I mean, we're just not able to ask the question because, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5117.6s)]
*  to get back to my witness in that last event is, they don't want to know. And they attack anyone [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5123.84s)]
*  who asks, including you. And I mean, watching what's happened to you has really been the [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5128.8s)]
*  greatest of all wake-up calls for me, because I would say of the senators I know, which is most [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5134.24s)]
*  of them, you're like the most temperamentally moderate and accountant number based, like not a [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5138.56s)]
*  wild-eyed radical at all. And there are some crazy people in the Congress, you're not. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5143.84s)]
*  You're the opposite, you like budgets and stuff. So if they're calling you a wacko, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5150.4800000000005s)]
*  they discredit themselves. That's just as an observer, my observation. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5156.08s)]
*  But again, that's what they do. So during COVID, quick story here, I was on a [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5159.84s)]
*  telephone town hall. And this is when Omnicron was ramping up. And this is already by the time [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5166.0s)]
*  we've got a partisan split on COVID. I mean, Republicans don't wear masks, Democrats do. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5172.0s)]
*  Republicans aren't freaked out by it, Democrats are. But again, I'm talking to these doctors, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5177.759999999999s)]
*  I know they were very concerned, for example, on Delta, that variant. It was more difficult to [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5182.4s)]
*  treat. They had to like double and triple the dose of ivermectin to have it actually be effective. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5187.679999999999s)]
*  So nobody knew what was going to happen with Omnicron. I think people were thinking it looked [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5191.44s)]
*  like it was going to be more mild. I'm on a telephone town hall with my constituents, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5195.759999999999s)]
*  probably a couple thousand, and I say, listen, take this seriously. COVID can still be a deadly [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5200.16s)]
*  disease. So whether you're vaccinated or not vaccinated, there are things you can do, vitamin D, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5205.28s)]
*  you know, you can gargle, you know, that helps reduce the viral load. Within 10 minutes, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5210.8s)]
*  my comms team were being contacted by national news outlets saying, what's this that we're hearing [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5218.08s)]
*  that Johnson's saying that Listerine will replace the vaccine. Now, of course, I said nothing of the [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5223.04s)]
*  kind. I just said, you know, there are things you can do to help protect yourself, you know. And [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5228.32s)]
*  they actually went so far as to go up to the governor of, I guess, New Hampshire, knocked on [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5234.400000000001s)]
*  his door, Republican governor and said, hey, what do you think about this wacko Republican [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5238.8s)]
*  senator who says that vaccines can, or Listerine can replace the vaccines? Well, when bad shit [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5242.320000000001s)]
*  crazy knocks on your door, slam the door in his face. I mean, that was the, so again, what they, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5248.16s)]
*  that was what Sununu said. Yeah, what they do, what they do, really one of the worst people [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5253.2s)]
*  ever exempt from politics. What they do is they discredit people. So then once they've done that, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5256.72s)]
*  you know, whether as falsely as they discredit you, now you discredit. So now next time, next [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5262.400000000001s)]
*  thing that comes up that is true, that you're talking about things, oh, this guy, he's thoroughly [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5268.0s)]
*  discredited. This guy's discredited. He's discredited. He thinks Listerine is that is, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5272.56s)]
*  that is what they do. Just like, you know, the CIA use the conspiracy theorist. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5275.92s)]
*  Just call some of the conspiracy theorists and then don't have to listen to him anymore. This [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5280.96s)]
*  guy's obviously a nutcase. So no, I've lived this up close and personal. The problem is that it does, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5284.08s)]
*  it does make everyone into a nihilist. It's, it's happened to me. I've tried and fight it. It's like, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5289.68s)]
*  it feels like everything's a lie. So you don't believe anything. And, you know, you just like, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5295.28s)]
*  don't go to the doctor, for example, which is where I am, or I know a lot of people like that. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5300.799999999999s)]
*  And that's, you know, you should probably go to the doctor. I mean, you know, get a checkup. That's [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5304.959999999999s)]
*  okay. But they've so devalued their own currency. They've so discredited themselves through lying [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5308.4s)]
*  and just the most evil kind of like blaming you for their problems that it's, I don't know, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5314.719999999999s)]
*  it's had all these effects on our society that I don't think we've even grappled with. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5320.08s)]
*  I try and tell established members of the medical profession, they ought to be concerned [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5324.0s)]
*  that a very large percentage of American people simply don't trust them anymore. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5330.96s)]
*  Like at all. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5334.96s)]
*  And that's not good. That's not good. You know, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5335.76s)]
*  when I was chairman of the European subcommittee on foreign relations, we had, I think, Gary [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5339.4400000000005s)]
*  Kasparov come in and talk about Russian disinformation. And I thought it was interesting [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5342.8s)]
*  because it's, they're not, Russia is not trying to convince you of something with their [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5348.0s)]
*  disinformation. They just want people not to trust anything. That is the whole purpose [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5352.96s)]
*  of their disinformation. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5358.08s)]
*  I feel like Albert Bourla did more to achieve that in the United States, the head of Pfizer, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5359.12s)]
*  than like any Russian ever could. You know, Joe Biden did that. Susan Rice did that. I mean, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5364.96s)]
*  all these people, they just lie right to your face and there's no recourse. So is there even [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5371.12s)]
*  conceivably a chance that Congress would repeal the protections that the vaccine makers enjoy? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5376.88s)]
*  That'll probably be a stretch. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5386.08s)]
*  Then can I ask this? Where's the trial bar on this? The trial bar has kind of like wrecked [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5387.4400000000005s)]
*  America by encouraging lawsuits for like the most frivolous possible. I could sue it all the time [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5391.4400000000005s)]
*  by people. I don't like what you said. I'm suing you and you have to deal with it. They come to [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5395.6s)]
*  your house, process servers. But, and that's because the trial bar has gotten rich from this, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5398.88s)]
*  from the tobacco, asbestos, all these shakedown, these totally fake moneymaking operations that [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5404.08s)]
*  they Morgan and Morgan with the ambulance chasing and all that. Why aren't they pushing [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5410.4s)]
*  for the repeal of the protections that vaccine makers uniquely enjoy? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5417.36s)]
*  That's a really good question. So as somebody from the private sector, I avoided lawyers in [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5422.5599999999995s)]
*  the judicial process like a play. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5427.5199999999995s)]
*  Me too. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5429.28s)]
*  So it's not, I'm not overly enthused about saying, but we need to expose vaccines to that check and [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5430.0s)]
*  balance. Okay. And we do. I would say we have to, we have to cap awards. I mean, there's got to be [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5438.56s)]
*  something because we do need pharmaceutical companies. I want those life saving drugs. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5444.24s)]
*  It can't be a pinata party for lawyers. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5449.36s)]
*  But it's got to be based on solid science. And that's why I really think the root cause, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5451.76s)]
*  I mean, the thing that Bobby Kennedy must address is we have to restore integrity to science. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5455.68s)]
*  This is, Eisenhower warned us about this in his farewell address. It doesn't give as much [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5461.4400000000005s)]
*  coverage, but public financing of science and research would lead to a scientific and [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5465.76s)]
*  technological lead to drive public policy. I would view that you corrupted. So when you pay for [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5470.88s)]
*  science, you get the result you want, whether it's climate change, whether it's vaccines, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5476.240000000001s)]
*  whether it's drugs and that type of thing. We need to restore integrity. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5480.56s)]
*  Peer review is a joke. Peer reviewers are basically volunteering. So you'll get peer [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5485.2s)]
*  reviewers who might have a different paper themselves and they just discredit that. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5489.76s)]
*  So what is truth? So you have to restore integrity to science. There's got to be like everybody from [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5495.12s)]
*  opposing sides have to be at the table. You've got to make your data available. Some of these [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5501.12s)]
*  studies are published. Nobody gets to see the data. So that I think is the first step that Bobby has [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5505.28s)]
*  to accomplish is try and restore integrity, particularly for government funded science. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5513.04s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Well, you tried the other day to raise [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5518.48s)]
*  science based questions about a pivotal events in American history, 24 years ago, 9 11. And you [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5521.76s)]
*  asked a question that I think any honest person would ask like, Building Seven was never hit [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5528.24s)]
*  by a plane. Why did it fall down in exactly the same way the first two towers did? That shouldn't [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5533.44s)]
*  be verboten. So you asked that question. I want to read the response from a Republican in the house [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5538.16s)]
*  a new member called Mike Lawler, a guest from New York. And he said this, I don't know if you know [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5542.88s)]
*  him. He probably don't. He just got there. Quote, Senator Johnson should stop peddling conspiracy [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5549.2s)]
*  theories about the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history and one that forever alter the [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5555.4400000000005s)]
*  lives of so many of my fellow New Yorkers. Crap like this dishonors and disrespects the innocent [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5559.92s)]
*  lives lost our brave first responders and all families and survivors who still carry the pain [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5565.76s)]
*  of 9 11 each and every day. So I think Lawler was like in high school when 9 11 happened. He [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5570.8s)]
*  doesn't really seem to represent New York anyway. But whatever the point is, why would he attack you [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5577.76s)]
*  personally for asking like the most obvious question ever, one rooted in science, which is [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5581.76s)]
*  how did this happen? Like, what is that? I sure heard my feelings. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5587.84s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin I know you don't care. But I just thought [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5592.16s)]
*  why Mike Lawler who literally just got there, got a lot of problems in New York? Why is he mad at you [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5595.04s)]
*  for asking that? You think he would want you to ask? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5600.24s)]
*  Mike Lawler What is so off base about that is the only reason I'm [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5602.08s)]
*  looking at this is because the then chairman of the permanent subcommittee investigation, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5606.8s)]
*  now I'm chair, but you know, Senator Blumenthal, he wanted to do this investigation on Saudis [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5611.84s)]
*  negotiation with the PGA. And you know, he's doing because he's from Connecticut and got 9 11 [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5617.2s)]
*  families, they want to know what Saudi involvement was. I didn't agree with that. I thought that this [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5622.88s)]
*  is a private sector negotiation, you know, let them take care of that. Okay. But he did anyway. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5627.36s)]
*  So leading up to a pretty well publicized hearing, I started getting 9 11 family members [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5633.92s)]
*  see me in the hallway, they would literally in the hallway in Congress. And they would have a [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5641.5199999999995s)]
*  heavily redacted document they got from the FBI in terms of what Saudis, the Saudi involvement was [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5646.639999999999s)]
*  in 9 11 what we knew. And they asked me, Can you please get this unredacted? We want to know what [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5651.2s)]
*  the government knows about these things. Now this is 20 some years after 9 11, it's probably about [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5657.5199999999995s)]
*  time. So in the hearing, you know, I asked a Senator Blumenthal, would you join me in requesting [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5661.36s)]
*  from the Biden administration, this information from 9 11 families? So so the well, he had to. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5669.12s)]
*  But the bottom line is, I got down this road because the 9 11 families want to know the answer. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5674.639999999999s)]
*  And once I opened up that inquiry, now I started getting all kinds of information. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5682.719999999999s)]
*  And I have things still redacted from 9 11 was 24 years ago, it changed this country completely. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5689.04s)]
*  Every American has I mean, Lawler's right in the sense that it really affected every American. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5695.679999999999s)]
*  Why would our government continue to lie about it? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5700.56s)]
*  I can't answer the question. All I can say is it raises my suspicion. Yeah. And then when you start [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5704.400000000001s)]
*  getting the again, I'm just as prone to everybody else going with that's wacko. But then you start [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5709.28s)]
*  getting the information. And you start going, Wow, is that weird? You know, building building number [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5718.32s)]
*  seven, you see it come down. And we've all watched because it's cool to watch, you know, [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5725.28s)]
*  these buildings being demolished, boom, just, you know, freefall. Well, the only way that happens is [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5729.28s)]
*  if you remove all of their supports at the same time, you blow them all out so that a building can [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5735.2s)]
*  really freefall. If it's collapsing something else, it's like, you know, you build like a fire, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5741.44s)]
*  and it collapses off to the side or something, right. So that was pretty strange. But, you know, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5748.639999999999s)]
*  the more the more documentaries I look at this stuff, the more information I receive, you talk [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5754.320000000001s)]
*  to guys like Richard gauge, the head of the architects for 911 truth, they feed you information. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5758.56s)]
*  And you start asking a lot of questions. And you just realize there's, there's a lot here that [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5765.76s)]
*  simply has not been answered. So you know, the firefighters want to know there was never a steel [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5771.280000000001s)]
*  structure, building that ever classed because of a fire. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5777.04s)]
*  Especially building seven, we don't get a lot of buildings that, you know, commercial airliners [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5782.88s)]
*  run into see, because it'd be like, who knows? Right, but building seven was not hit by anything. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5786.639999999999s)]
*  It's actually quite a distance from the other towers is not right next door. It's [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5791.04s)]
*  hundreds of yards away, I think. And debris hit it and caught fire. And then the whole thing [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5795.2s)]
*  collapsed. As we saw on camera. That was not even included in the 911 report. There's no [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5801.76s)]
*  mention of building seven. So anyway, the point is, you also have people, because they never [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5807.92s)]
*  explored explosions. But there are, you know, a guy named Graham McQueen, research this, he dug up, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5813.280000000001s)]
*  you know, footage filmed at ground zero, 156 witnesses, you know, first responders saying [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5819.52s)]
*  they heard explosions before the buildings came down. So what is I mean, there, trust me, there [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5825.2s)]
*  a lot of unanswered questions. I mean, things he just can't explain that. So I'm not sure where [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5831.12s)]
*  it goes. I know you had Kurt Weldon on. He's got a lot of information on kind of the before and after [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5839.04s)]
*  because he's connected to the firefighting community, the firefighters want to know. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5846.16s)]
*  So there are some very legitimate questions, a lot of them, that remain unanswered, all swept [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5851.44s)]
*  under the rug. They were in you look at this news reports are talking about explosions. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5858.96s)]
*  By the next day, nobody was there. There is there's a lot of there's a lot of power. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5864.72s)]
*  I'm interested in your evolution on this. So you said before Blumenthal, your colleague, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5870.4800000000005s)]
*  Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut, raise kind of raise this in a different way. You were not [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5877.04s)]
*  wondering what happened to building seven. No, never. Don't think I've ever heard of it. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5885.44s)]
*  Really? Yeah, I figured the Twin Towers came down. Again, I'm not a New Yorker. You know, this [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5890.639999999999s)]
*  infected all of us. We all saw them come down. We said the world has changed. Yes, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5895.919999999999s)]
*  this changed the world and it did. Oh, more than any other events in my life. Not for the better. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5899.44s)]
*  No, not at all. This is this is a seminal event in our lifetime. And the fact that there's so [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5904.16s)]
*  many unanswered questions that the Bush administration was so resistant to even a [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5910.4s)]
*  9-11 commission that the commissioners claimed that it was set up to fail, that you've got a [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5914.4s)]
*  Bob Carey who's since passed said this is a 30 year conspiracy. It's I mean, I could go I could [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5919.679999999999s)]
*  go on and on. Yeah. Of Nebraska. Yeah, the comment comment. Medal of Honor in Vietnam, by the way, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5925.28s)]
*  kind of walking away. This is a 30 year conspiracy. What do you mean by that? Nobody ever found out. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5932.32s)]
*  So again, that's I'm just throwing out little snippets. But as I said, it's it's it's it's [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5936.4s)]
*  amazing the questions that you see the legitimate questions have been raised that remain unanswered. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5943.599999999999s)]
*  That's all that's all I can say. All I have is questions right now. I don't have I get it. But [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5948.96s)]
*  I just I feel exactly the same way. I have no clue. I have no theory of everything in this at all. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5952.799999999999s)]
*  But my question is, you just came up this cold, though. Yeah, no, this was not something that I [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5959.759999999999s)]
*  was hankering to delve into. One of the questions is kind of like Bobby Kennedy, how he got involved [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5964.72s)]
*  in childhood vaccines. Yes. He was giving all these speeches on the environment and all these moms that [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5970.8s)]
*  show up with their t shirts. And he kept him at bay for quite some time till one of the moms [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5975.360000000001s)]
*  found out where he lived. Came with him came to his house with a stack of science, which he knew [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5979.92s)]
*  how to read because he was an environmental lawyer and said, I'm not going to leave till you read [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5985.12s)]
*  this. And to his credit, he sat down and read it. And further to his credits, once he read it, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5989.12s)]
*  he couldn't you know, once his eyes were open, he couldn't he couldn't close them as much as he [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5994.96s)]
*  probably wanted to as much as he realized the morass he was stepping into. I can't close my [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=5998.72s)]
*  eyes. I can't. And, you know, particularly with childhood vaccine use is bad enough for the COVID [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6004.4s)]
*  vaccine. I mean, I, you know, the Ernest Ramirez, you know, lost his son. I mean, it's just it's [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6009.28s)]
*  just heartbreaking. I mean, these Facebook dissolving these groups that were the only [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6015.12s)]
*  lifeline for some of these vaccine injured, and they started committing suicide afterwards, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6021.599999999999s)]
*  because they lost that connection that they didn't have before these groups. But you, I mean, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6025.04s)]
*  you look at the documentary just vaxxed. And you see these parents had a and they have the video [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6029.92s)]
*  of a perfectly normal child. And they take them in for a well visit. So they get a vaccine that [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6037.04s)]
*  night they spike a fever have a seizure. Now they got a 26 year old son who is extremely autistic, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6042.08s)]
*  can't verbalize acts up as I mean, it's just it's horrible. And you see the stats where you go from [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6050.5599999999995s)]
*  it's hard to verify the 1001. But I mean, we know by CEOs, CDC's own hundreds to one to now [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6058.4s)]
*  30 something to one. What's by the way, while they've actually narrowed the definition of [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6065.92s)]
*  autism, they didn't expand it, they narrowed it. What's causing that? And, you know, after the [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6071.36s)]
*  makers of vax went on a road trip with a with a bus premiering this thing, and other parents would [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6080.0s)]
*  come up to the bus bus. And so they started videotaping their stories. And they got some like [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6087.44s)]
*  10,000 stories of parents almost identical, it's like perfectly normal child got the video to prove [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6093.28s)]
*  it. Go in, you know, within that night or within days, you start looking at the increase in SIDS [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6100.16s)]
*  versus the increase of the vaccine schedule. Yeah, I'm not a doctor, not a medical researcher. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6108.72s)]
*  My eyes have just been opened up to how so much true so much information, so many questions, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6114.8s)]
*  probably the best way to put it, who just been suppressed, you can't even ask them anybody who [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6121.92s)]
*  does gets marginalized, vilified, discredited. And that's that's how they that's how they battle [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6126.32s)]
*  this. They don't battle it with the truth. They don't know in my public events, I always invited [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6132.719999999999s)]
*  the federal officials, I always invited the executives from the big pharma, you come in and [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6137.12s)]
*  defend yourself. This is an open forum, I'll give you plenty of time, I'll be very fair. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6142.719999999999s)]
*  You know, speak your piece, I want to hear from you. They won't do it. They will. I mean, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6147.12s)]
*  Peter Hotez famously, you know, Mr. Vaccine Pusher gets offered what was finally offered [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6152.72s)]
*  two points some million dollars, sit down and argue with not a doctor, a lawyer. Yeah, you know, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6158.320000000001s)]
*  just debate RFK Jr. And he wouldn't even do it. What does that tell you? He's just calling people [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6165.12s)]
*  names. So back to 9-11 for a minute, you never really thought about it. Like most people, me too, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6170.72s)]
*  I yelled at anyone who asked questions about it myself. So I'm sympathetic actually, in some ways [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6177.68s)]
*  to people who don't want to hear it. But now that you've looked into it, and you said you don't have [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6182.08s)]
*  a coherent theory as to what it was, but you've got a lot of questions, which questions trouble [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6188.08s)]
*  you the most? Well, it starts with building seven. Yes. Where you look at that and it just, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6191.84s)]
*  yeah, I mean, this is really weird. You know, it does come down just like a, you know, building [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6199.6s)]
*  demolition type of project. You get a documentary of this Alaskan structural engineering professor [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6205.84s)]
*  that does a four-year study on it, pretty well debunks NIST's analysis. Again, you don't have [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6213.28s)]
*  to be a structural engineer to say this really doesn't make sense. When you start putting together [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6220.08s)]
*  at what temperature steel melts, they had molten steel in the twin towers, and I'm not sure we had [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6225.84s)]
*  a number seven. But if one column, one column expanded and went off kilter, and that's what [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6233.92s)]
*  brought the whole thing down, well, it wouldn't come down so symmetrically. You wouldn't have a [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6240.08s)]
*  freefall. Then you get deeper into it. And you know, there's a thing, his name was Barry Jennings. He [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6245.52s)]
*  was there, went up there. They'd already cleared out building seven, even though he went up there [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6251.52s)]
*  to their command center and somebody goes, get out of there. It was predict, I mean, literally [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6256.24s)]
*  predicted to come down, even though, again, a steel structured building had never collapsed due [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6262.72s)]
*  to fire because they're protected that way. He heard explosions. He had to got down to the sixth [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6268.320000000001s)]
*  flight, the sixth floor and had to go back up to eight because something had been blown out. And [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6275.52s)]
*  again, what, what caused it? This building was not hit by an airplane. No, I mean, they did, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6280.56s)]
*  it was damaged, but even NIST says, you know, not significant damage by the twin towers falling. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6285.84s)]
*  So again, there's just so many things. I mean, you could spend quite some time. I mean, the ash [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6291.92s)]
*  contains residual of both burnt and unburnt thermite, which is used to demolish buildings. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6296.96s)]
*  And it's military grade and there's nanoparticle thermite and you have all these metal spheres that [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6305.28s)]
*  you only get these iron spheres with extreme temperatures. And again, jet fuel burns at below, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6311.84s)]
*  I think a thousand degrees Fahrenheit and nothing's adding up. I mean, you know, just [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6316.88s)]
*  structurally, just basic engineering, basic physics, it doesn't make sense. So I would like [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6322.4800000000005s)]
*  to, you know, NIST took years to conclude the report to just a lay person. It doesn't make sense. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6328.0s)]
*  Particularly when you listen to the structural engineering professor just, you know, nuked the [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6336.32s)]
*  explanation. They never looked at a plausibility of some kind of control demolition. They never [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6341.36s)]
*  put in their report all these reports of people saying there were explosions. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6349.28s)]
*  And there's just so much ignored. I mean, in fact, the Bush administration [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6353.759999999999s)]
*  dragged their feet, obstructed setting up a 9-11 commission. Again, I could go on and on and on [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6358.639999999999s)]
*  and then I don't have any answers. I just have a host of questions. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6365.6s)]
*  Then if you were upset, if you were Congressman Mike Lawler, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6369.360000000001s)]
*  and you were upset that someone was a conspiracy theorist, if you were sincerely bothered by that, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6375.52s)]
*  by conspiracy theories, okay, I understand that. Then you would know the only way to end a [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6380.320000000001s)]
*  conspiracy theory is with an explanation that makes sense. Why is there no effort to provide one? Why [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6385.200000000001s)]
*  isn't there a study, a government study of Building 7? And just let's put this stuff to rest, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6392.4s)]
*  like defeat it with the truth. Why isn't there? My guess is because they are very effective at [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6398.5599999999995s)]
*  marginalizing and discrediting anybody who can answer questions. But why would they want to hide [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6405.04s)]
*  the truth? You'd have to know exactly what they're trying to hide. To be able to answer that question, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6408.799999999999s)]
*  I can't. Of all issues for Mike Lawler to be upset about this one, it really caught my eye. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6413.599999999999s)]
*  Like, why are you mad about it? Again, you just got there, and you're attacking a senior senator [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6419.84s)]
*  who's thoughtful and sober and asking totally real questions. Who are you covering for exactly, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6427.92s)]
*  Mike Lawler? And by the way, it wasn't like I went out of my way and had an interview just on this. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6434.0s)]
*  I mean, I was asked a question, probably wandered into a space I maybe shouldn't have wandered into. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6438.08s)]
*  But again, I was just describing all the ways the federal government has lied to us. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6444.08s)]
*  I've been... You're part of the federal government by the way. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6449.2s)]
*  I've been targeted by the FBI's misinformation campaign on Hunter Biden's computer. I mean, [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6451.36s)]
*  they've given me BS briefings to throw me off the trail. So I've seen this. Again, I didn't run [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6456.639999999999s)]
*  for the US Senate because I want to get involved in investigations. I ran because we were more [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6464.719999999999s)]
*  generic kids future because I knew Obamacare wouldn't work. But you become chairman of Homeland [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6468.639999999999s)]
*  Security. Within... Immediately, you've got the Hillary Clinton email scandal. That's in our [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6473.76s)]
*  committee's jurisdiction, federal records, plus for the oversight committee. So you start to do [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6480.08s)]
*  those investigations and just one investigation, just more so than another. The same cast of [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6484.16s)]
*  characters, the FBI that wrote the exoneration memo for James Comey transferring the crossfire [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6489.2s)]
*  hurricane to the group that... Vindman and the impeachment inquiry of Trump. You just see it all [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6496.16s)]
*  and your eyes are opened up to the total corruption of these federal government agencies. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6505.36s)]
*  And you realize we've just been lied to over and over and over and over again throughout history, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6509.5199999999995s)]
*  at least history that's recent in my past. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6516.96s)]
*  I wonder why you haven't just ignored it like everybody else. I met you right in early 2011, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6519.92s)]
*  right when almost 15 years ago when you first got there, you're a business guy from Wisconsin, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6524.96s)]
*  very closely divided state. You didn't win by a huge margin. You never won by 30 points. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6529.92s)]
*  So whenever you talk about something in public, you're taking a bigger risk than say the senator [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6536.0s)]
*  from Utah or South Dakota because you could lose an election. I never in a million years thought [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6541.4400000000005s)]
*  you of all people would be the guy to like ask questions about 9-11 or the Vax or January 6th [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6546.96s)]
*  and a whole bunch of other issues. And yet you have been the only guy in a lot of cases to ask [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6553.2s)]
*  those questions. Why? Why are you doing this? Would it just be easier to talk about tax reform [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6558.16s)]
*  or something? [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6564.16s)]
*  I would ask you the same question. Why have you been so instrumental in broadening the Overton [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6565.2s)]
*  window on some of these things? And of course, the Overton window is all about the overton window. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6571.04s)]
*  This is what you can discuss without threat or without risk. But you got to go beyond that. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6577.28s)]
*  Because I was part of the cover-up and I feel guilty about it. That's why I'm trying to atone [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6585.36s)]
*  for my previous sense. That's the real reason. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6589.68s)]
*  In my case, I have a responsibility. I was chairman of the Senate Oversight Committee. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6591.4400000000005s)]
*  So again, you start there, Hillary Clinton has this email scandal. That's my committee's [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6596.400000000001s)]
*  jurisdiction. That has to be investigated. I can't turn a blind eye toward that. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6600.96s)]
*  And then like Bobby Kennedy, once your eyes are open to this, you also can't turn a blind's eye. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6605.68s)]
*  But I think it's just the empathy you have for the vaccine injured. I didn't reach out to them [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6611.52s)]
*  because I was holding hearings because nobody else was on early treatment. When I still the [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6616.72s)]
*  chairmanship, people start reaching out to you. And then you become aware of these people that [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6622.320000000001s)]
*  are completely being gaslit or being ignored. I could not believe in that Milwaukee event I held [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6627.12s)]
*  in June 2021 where I met Breanne Dressen and Maddie DeGarry and other vaccine injured Cheryl [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6632.4s)]
*  Rutgers. Again, I was hoping there would be some measure of sympathy expressed by the news media. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6639.28s)]
*  They would ask them their stories. Tell us about your experience. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6646.48s)]
*  Now the first question was, hey, Ken Rutgers, you just want to try and make money off of a lawsuit [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6649.839999999999s)]
*  here? Is that why you're doing this? So you develop an empathy for these people. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6653.36s)]
*  And then, you know, listen, I'm not in New York or I wasn't impacted any more than the world was [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6659.2s)]
*  by 9-11. Not anywhere like the firefighters who lost their loved ones or the 9-11 families. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6665.04s)]
*  But then they come up to you and they're literally begging you, please, I just, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6671.599999999999s)]
*  I want some closure here. I want to know what happened. The government's not being honest. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6675.92s)]
*  You combine that with the fact that I know the government just freaking lies to their teeth to [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6680.88s)]
*  the American public all the time, which is outrageous. It is outrageous. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6685.04s)]
*  Okay. So, you know, my eyes are opened. Somebody's got to do it. I actually have [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6690.32s)]
*  responsibility to do it. Now I'm chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6696.24s)]
*  That's responsibility. Now you have to pick your targets. I've always said I'm like a mosquito in [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6702.16s)]
*  a nudist colony. It's a target rich environment. But I guess I'm focusing on the things where [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6706.72s)]
*  there are legitimate questions by Americans who are grieving, who are suffering [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6712.56s)]
*  because they don't have an answer, because their vaccine injuries aren't being taken seriously. So [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6719.52s)]
*  we're not providing the research for it. So they're not getting treatment. They can't be helped. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6723.92s)]
*  So you take up their cause because nobody else is doing it and you have a responsibility to take [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6728.72s)]
*  up that cause. So now I mean, my life would be a whole lot easier if I just ignored this stuff. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6733.84s)]
*  What do your colleagues think? It's such a rebuke. I know you like them and they like you and I'm not [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6738.719999999999s)]
*  trying to cause you any problems, but kind of a rebuke to them. It's like the vaccine injured show [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6743.36s)]
*  up at their offices too. Yeah, that was actually I encouraged the vaccine injured to go because I [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6748.5599999999995s)]
*  like my colleagues. It's a collegiate place. So I said show up, request and be pretty insistent, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6754.5599999999995s)]
*  meet with the Senator, meet with your House members, whatever. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6765.2s)]
*  So they showed up in mass and I really felt bad afterwards because they were treated horribly in [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6769.76s)]
*  many cases. Seriously? Yeah, horribly. Rudely. Staff only met with them, treated them rudely. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6775.28s)]
*  It was not a good experience for the vaccine injured. Again, I didn't witness it. I just [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6784.0s)]
*  heard the stories. All I can say is I felt terrible having encouraged them to do that and it ended up [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6788.24s)]
*  being such a bust and such a negative experience in so many cases. And their only crime was [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6793.84s)]
*  following instructions from the US Congress and the executive branch, just like doing what they [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6798.96s)]
*  were told to do. Yeah, I mean they were accused, the most absurd charge level at them, that they [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6802.400000000001s)]
*  were anti-vax. I mean, Maddie DeGuerre, her mother signed her up for the trial. Breanne Dressen, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6807.360000000001s)]
*  she signed up for the AstraZeneca trial. And what happened to them? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6815.360000000001s)]
*  Well, Breanne Dressen, close to suicide. I mean, she couldn't be touched. I mean, she was sensitive [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6819.2s)]
*  to light. She has all these neurological problems. Maddie DeGuerre has a feeding tube. She's in a [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6826.4s)]
*  wheelchair. I mean, horribly. And in her case, the drug company said that she has a stomach ache, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6831.84s)]
*  basically. That's how they reported it to their government reporting. That this girl who'd been [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6839.36s)]
*  in the hospital dozens of times, her young life, I wouldn't say it's over, but it's not normal [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6844.56s)]
*  anymore. No, these people suffered horrible industries. I mean, Ernesto Ramirez, single parent, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6851.84s)]
*  his son, I think 16-year-old son, somewhere around that age, it's his life, died suddenly. Boom. And [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6861.4400000000005s)]
*  you just heard this. Again, you saw that so many times. And it's still being covered up because [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6871.12s)]
*  nobody wants to admit it. I mean, if you're a doctor and you push this or recommend it to your [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6878.0s)]
*  patients, you don't want to know that something you recommended or pushed on your patients might [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6882.24s)]
*  have killed them or resulted in permanent industry. Members of Congress who cut videos, you know, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6887.12s)]
*  get the vaccine. You know, our federal health officials, the news media who relentlessly, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6890.96s)]
*  Stephen Colbert, you think he'll ever admit to vaccine injuries after he does his little skits [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6897.12s)]
*  with the little, you know, hypodermic needles in the background? So no, I mean, that's the whole [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6901.919999999999s)]
*  problem is there's you've got an entire society that doesn't want to admit they're wrong, including [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6908.959999999999s)]
*  people who got the injection that don't really want to think about it, just move on with their [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6913.839999999999s)]
*  life. And by the way, to provide some comfort, I think they were definitely hot lots. I've written [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6919.2s)]
*  oversight letters on this. It looks like probably about 5% of the 4% of the injections created about [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6924.24s)]
*  80% of the adverse events. I can't remember the exact percentages, but really? Oh, yeah. No. And [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6929.36s)]
*  so I write to the CDC that don't reply back. But it's just to me, manufacturing, this is a process [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6934.88s)]
*  out of control. I mean, you've got you really do. I mean, I don't have the stats right with me, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6943.04s)]
*  but it's obvious there were hot lots here, which should provide some people comfort. I think about [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6946.88s)]
*  75% of the vaccine last very few adverse events associated with it all. You know, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6951.04s)]
*  I won't speculate why, but they're hot lots. But you write about them, you lay out all the stats and [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6956.64s)]
*  the response to get from the CDC is we don't see any hot lots. We don't see it's just like, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6963.36s)]
*  we don't see a safety signal. Well, if you're not looking for it, you're not going to see a safety [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6969.6s)]
*  signal. But these people are in charge of public health, they're supposed to care. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6974.0s)]
*  Now they're there. They were they were fully vested in this facts in this injection. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6978.0s)]
*  This was the solution. They pushed it. They ignored the safety surveillance. I mean, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6983.76s)]
*  the V safe system. This was set up specifically to track the safety of the COVID injection. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6988.96s)]
*  10 million people volunteered on this on their mobile device. Now, the questions they asked were [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=6996.08s)]
*  pretty mild. They really weren't designed to really expose serious adverse events. You know, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7000.96s)]
*  they had a list of kind of mild symptoms, you know, irritation in the arm, blah, blah, blah, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7006.64s)]
*  blah, blah. The second part was a little bit more serious. Did you lose a day of work or school? [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7010.160000000001s)]
*  Did you seek medical care? That's as serious as a guy. Okay. But the results were shocking. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7017.04s)]
*  And even more shocking, they hid it from the public for two years to Aaron Siri two years. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7024.320000000001s)]
*  So the government to release the results of the online mobile application v safe data, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7029.12s)]
*  the results were 25% of the people of the 10 million people 25% lost a day of work or school [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7036.96s)]
*  because their adverse event was, you know, they felt bad enough 25% 8% think 7.8% sought medical [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7043.44s)]
*  care. And I think more than a majority two or three times. That's a reasonably sick, [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7050.96s)]
*  because I know people with adverse events that suffered and they never sought medical care. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7057.92s)]
*  So well, get over it, you know, of course, that's what the officials told us who all that [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7064.08s)]
*  just shows you it's effective. Your arms burning up, you know, you're numb, you can't you can't, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7068.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, you can't walk. Well, that's just it's working. It's working medicine. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7074.4s)]
*  Aaron Norris Well, you remain cheerful and single minded, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7079.44s)]
*  and I think underrated in many ways, as US Senator. So I'm grateful that you spent all this time. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7086.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7093.84s)]
*  Leo Dion Well, thank you. And again, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7094.24s)]
*  I've been watching you, you know, I appreciate what you've done the risk you've taken your career. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7097.84s)]
*  I mean, all the issues, you know, going to Russia, questioning what happened on January 6, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7103.92s)]
*  I mean, all these things, you are, and this is important, you are expanding the Overton window, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7111.68s)]
*  you are, you are helping expand what is can be talked about. And the harm done because we [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7116.4s)]
*  haven't even been able to ask some of these questions, we haven't been able to discuss this, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7123.92s)]
*  you know, we haven't had the type of debate that we should have in this country. You're a big part [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7128.56s)]
*  of that. And I thank you for what you've done. Aaron Norris It's been easy and fun, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7135.84s)]
*  but I appreciate it. Thank you, Senator. Leo Dion Thank you. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7139.68s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show on one level. That's not surprising. That's [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7147.120000000001s)]
*  what they do. But on another level, it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7152.240000000001s)]
*  now, all the change taking place in our economy, and our politics with the wars on the cusp of [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7156.24s)]
*  fighting right now. Google has decided you should have less information rather than more. And that [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7161.5199999999995s)]
*  is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. That's a [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7167.679999999999s)]
*  waste of time. We're not in charge of Google, or we could find a way around it a way that you could [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7173.92s)]
*  actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. The way to do that [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7178.24s)]
*  on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe. Hit the little bell icon [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7183.36s)]
*  to be notified when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have a much higher chance [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7188.16s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMk0orYKXQk&t=7193.36s)]
