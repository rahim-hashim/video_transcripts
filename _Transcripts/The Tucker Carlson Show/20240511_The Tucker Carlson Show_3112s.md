# Trudeau’s Brother Speaks Out, “Justin Is Not a Free Man”
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4)
*  Most people in Western countries, in the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=0.0s)]
*  in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=5.54s)]
*  most people who lived in those countries two years ago [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=6.38s)]
*  got the COVID Vax. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=9.08s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=10.72s)]
*  And maybe because of that fact, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=11.66s)]
*  very few people wanna talk about what that was, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=14.1s)]
*  not just what the Vax itself was [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=16.92s)]
*  and what it may do to the human body and the human brain. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=18.72s)]
*  Those are worthy conversations, important conversation, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=21.26s)]
*  necessary conversations, ignored conversations. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=24.32s)]
*  But the bigger conversation is why were governments [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=26.52s)]
*  across the West pulling out all stops to force people [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  to take this compound that they called a vaccine? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=34.32s)]
*  What was this? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=37.44s)]
*  And what do we learn about the motives [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=38.34s)]
*  and the aims of those governments [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=41.22s)]
*  by their behavior around the Vax? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  What do we learn? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=45.94s)]
*  Because those countries, all of them, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=47.36s)]
*  revealed that they were not in fact democracies, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=50.4s)]
*  they were not free countries at all. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=52.18s)]
*  They were something very different. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  And if you go back and you watch the tape [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=55.54s)]
*  and you watch how Western leaders talked [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=57.2s)]
*  about the COVID Vax and about people [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=59.18s)]
*  who didn't wanna get vaccinated, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=60.9s)]
*  you learned a lot about them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=64.14s)]
*  In fact, it's not your body, your choice in their view. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=65.86s)]
*  It's their body and their choice. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=68.14s)]
*  And in no country was this clearer maybe than Canada, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=70.7s)]
*  where the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=73.66s)]
*  not only told people to get this drug, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=75.1s)]
*  but attacked anyone who wouldn't as illegitimate, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=79.18s)]
*  as evil as a fifth column within the borders of Canada [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=83.58s)]
*  seeking to overthrow the democracy of Canada. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=86.78s)]
*  In case you've forgotten, here he is. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=89.9s)]
*  For the vast, vast majority of people, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=92.02s)]
*  the rules are very simple. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=94.74s)]
*  To travel, you've got to be vaccinated. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=97.06s)]
*  When people see that we're in lockdowns [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=100.5s)]
*  or serious public health restrictions right now, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=103.3s)]
*  because the risk posed to all of us by unvaccinated people, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=107.3s)]
*  people get angry. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  Proof of vaccination will be required [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  by no later than the end of this month [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=117.06s)]
*  for all federal employees. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=119.38s)]
*  And by mid-November, enforcement measures in place [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=121.62s)]
*  will make sure that everyone is vaccinated. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=126.44s)]
*  If you don't wanna get vaccinated, that's your choice, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=129.34s)]
*  but don't think you can get on a plane or a train [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=132.8s)]
*  besides vaccinated people and put them at risk. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=135.66s)]
*  Wait a second, if you don't take this untested drug, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=139.78s)]
*  you can't travel within your own country? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=143.94s)]
*  You are inherently unclean and clean, obedient people [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=147.06s)]
*  shouldn't be forced to sit next to you? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=151.3s)]
*  That's like Nazi stuff, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=152.66s)]
*  I mean, that's what we read about when we read [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=154.62s)]
*  about the darkness descending on Germany in the 1930s. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=157.86s)]
*  That's why we aren't for fascism, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=162.34s)]
*  because we're not for that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=164.58s)]
*  That's why we're free and they were enslaved. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=165.7s)]
*  And yet all of a sudden our leaders, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=167.7s)]
*  particularly that leader, were just saying it out loud. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=169.06s)]
*  You must do this or else you have no rights at all. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=171.5s)]
*  Amazing, and of course, most people in Canada, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=176.26s)]
*  as most people in the United States went along with it, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=177.78s)]
*  but some didn't and famously a group of truckers in Canada [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=179.7s)]
*  decided to form what they called a Freedom Convoy, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  drive to Ottawa to protest this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  And in response, the prime minister of that country [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  in the history of Canada. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=192.73999999999998s)]
*  And this gave the police among other powers, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=194.78s)]
*  the power to freeze your bank account, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=196.58s)]
*  to shut down your Bitcoin exchange. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=199.78s)]
*  So it turns out we spent like 80 years [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  talking about dictators and fascists, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=207.38000000000002s)]
*  but when they emerged in our own societies, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=209.08s)]
*  we didn't even notice. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=212.38000000000002s)]
*  But a few people did notice. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=214.3s)]
*  And one of them is a man called Kyle Kemper. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=215.34s)]
*  He's a Canadian. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=217.06s)]
*  He happens to be the half brother of Justin Trudeau. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=218.0s)]
*  And it may or may not be personal, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=220.9s)]
*  but he went up on exactly the other side [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=222.52s)]
*  of this question of medical freedom and bodily autonomy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=224.66s)]
*  And so we thought it'd be interesting to talk to him [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=228.46s)]
*  about what we're watching, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=230.62s)]
*  not just in his country, Birth Canada, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=231.54s)]
*  but around the world. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=233.06s)]
*  And he joins us now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=234.74s)]
*  Kyle, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=235.98s)]
*  Tucker, it's a real pleasure to be on. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=237.74s)]
*  So I do think, I mean, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=239.42s)]
*  this just happened a couple of years ago. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  So it's hard to know when you're in the middle of something, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=243.42s)]
*  what's really significant and what isn't. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=245.46s)]
*  But two years out, it does seem like this question [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  of whether you have the right to decide [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=249.26s)]
*  what drugs go into your body. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=251.94s)]
*  This is kind of maybe the central right [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=254.66s)]
*  that we have as free people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=256.9s)]
*  How do you read what happened in Canada over the Vax? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=259.5s)]
*  Like, what did that mean? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=263.1s)]
*  No, I mean, I think all over the world, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=264.58s)]
*  there are people who were very distrustful of it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=267.5s)]
*  And I think we've been warned. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=269.98s)]
*  There's been many warning signs [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=271.34s)]
*  that there would be a mass injection campaign [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=272.98s)]
*  coming at some point. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=276.2s)]
*  And then with, you know- [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=277.56s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=279.62s)]
*  You believed before COVID even got here [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  that the government of your country, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  my country, of all of our countries [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=287.3s)]
*  might force us to take an injection of something. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=288.74s)]
*  I mean, that's what many people were kind of warning about. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=290.82s)]
*  I think Aaron Russo many, many, many moons ago [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=293.38s)]
*  was suggesting that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=296.26s)]
*  Did you take that seriously at the time? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=298.9s)]
*  When you keep hearing this warning [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=303.41999999999996s)]
*  that this might come down at some point, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=307.82s)]
*  and then you see with the COVID-19 scenario, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=310.18s)]
*  everyone painting fear, fear, fear, fear, fear [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=314.94s)]
*  around the virus and hope, hope, hope, hope, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=318.98s)]
*  hope around the vaccine. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=321.42s)]
*  That just, you know, your spidey sense kind of goes up. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=324.42s)]
*  The hair stand up on your arms. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=326.68s)]
*  And you think, you know, something's amiss here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=329.74s)]
*  And then when it becomes, okay, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=333.06s)]
*  everybody must do this for the greater good. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=334.62s)]
*  And you see all of a sudden, you know, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=337.14s)]
*  public officials like my brother [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  out there being effectively salesmen [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=343.5s)]
*  for the pharmaceutical industry, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  otherwise promoting a product that you can't advertise. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=348.46s)]
*  And yet you have the schools, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  you have it being pushed across all of society [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=355.3s)]
*  in such incredible levels that, you know, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  there was a lot of people who were like you and I, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=361.62s)]
*  suspicious of it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=366.53999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, personally, you know, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=367.85999999999996s)]
*  I have five children and six on the way, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=369.74s)]
*  and I'm not willing to expose myself [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=371.74s)]
*  to something that could be very dangerous. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=375.58s)]
*  There's one, there's a difference between fear and danger. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=378.46s)]
*  And it's like, you know, if you operate in a land [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=381.26s)]
*  of worrying about all the things that scare you, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=383.53999999999996s)]
*  that's one thing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=387.38s)]
*  To be aware and conscious of clear and present dangers [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=388.82s)]
*  and to be reactive to that is important. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=391.86s)]
*  And that's, you know, what I chose to do. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=394.18s)]
*  And many of us have chosen to. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=396.5s)]
*  Me too. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=398.14s)]
*  And I had pretty much the same reaction. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=399.38s)]
*  My spudgy senses went off. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=400.94s)]
*  I'm not taking that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=401.94s)]
*  I mean, my family's not doing that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=402.98s)]
*  But I didn't really have a framework for understanding it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=405.1s)]
*  I mean, it was, from my perspective, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=407.1s)]
*  I think I was watching the wrong media or something, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=408.94s)]
*  it came kind of out of the blue. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=411.26s)]
*  And all of a sudden you see these governments acting, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=412.62s)]
*  you know, in authoritarian totalitarian ways. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=415.62s)]
*  And I'm still shocked when I think about it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=418.9s)]
*  You seem less shocked. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=421.26s)]
*  You know, I was always worried that what might happen, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=423.54s)]
*  you know, when Justin was in power, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=427.54s)]
*  like what kind of scenario could happen if another, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=430.62s)]
*  you know, a 9-11 type massive global scenario were to unfold. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=433.1s)]
*  Sure enough, you know, we see the- [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=437.58000000000004s)]
*  Why were you worried about that? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=439.54s)]
*  Because what type of actions, you know, would come out of it? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=441.82000000000005s)]
*  Just like in the wake of 9-11, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=445.62s)]
*  we saw all the nations of the world kind of come together [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  underneath, you know, this anti-terror plan [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=451.66s)]
*  and this war on terror. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=454.02s)]
*  Now we have, you know, the war on COVID. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=455.46s)]
*  Again, it's interesting to talk to someone [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=461.94s)]
*  who was a little more enlightened a little earlier [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=464.26s)]
*  than I was, because I saw your brother and I thought, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=467.82s)]
*  well, you know, he's a liberal. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=470.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=472.1s)]
*  Like in a true set, probably smokes a lot of weed [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=472.94s)]
*  and has, you know, dreams about world peace or something. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=475.86s)]
*  That's the opposite of what this turned out to be. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=479.38s)]
*  How did you know that? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=482.98s)]
*  Well, I mean, first, I mean, I loved my brother, Justin. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=484.54s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=487.38s)]
*  Through and through. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, I don't think he's never smoked [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=489.06s)]
*  that much weed. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=491.54s)]
*  He was not really into that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=492.38s)]
*  That was not his thing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=496.5s)]
*  He's pretty on point. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=497.9s)]
*  But I will, you know, add to it that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=502.18s)]
*  he liked to be the, you know, he likes the attention [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=506.26000000000005s)]
*  and he likes to be the leader of, you know, of the show. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=510.02000000000004s)]
*  And when this, when the opportunity for him to be, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=515.5s)]
*  you know, following his father's footsteps [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=521.1s)]
*  and be, you know, the prime minister of Canada, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=523.14s)]
*  because, you know, if you're growing up as a child [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=525.98s)]
*  and you see, you know, your father as the prime minister [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=528.1s)]
*  and having access to all of the, you know, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=533.26s)]
*  the lights, the events, the interactivities. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=540.5s)]
*  The trappings, we say. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=546.06s)]
*  Trappings, yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=547.3399999999999s)]
*  You kind of want that too. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=548.5s)]
*  And I think, I don't know what exactly took place, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=549.5s)]
*  but, you know, at some point it was like, yeah, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=552.42s)]
*  it was either Justin was kind of identified [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=555.14s)]
*  as someone who'd make a great prime minister [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=557.3s)]
*  and was, you know, helped in that journey. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=560.7800000000001s)]
*  And, you know, quite frankly, Justin is, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=563.82s)]
*  he's an amazing person and he was able to connect [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  with so many people and very like, you know, lovable. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=568.4200000000001s)]
*  But again, once this COVID and the vaccine thing took place [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=572.7s)]
*  and his words that he was using, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=577.22s)]
*  which I don't know where, were really coming from his heart [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=579.62s)]
*  or were they coming from, you know, the teleprompter, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=582.7800000000001s)]
*  you know, what was really being. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=586.58s)]
*  But it sounds like you saw in him, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=588.54s)]
*  despite your love for him and your acknowledgement [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=590.18s)]
*  that he's talented, which he obviously is, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=592.18s)]
*  he became prime minister, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=593.74s)]
*  you saw in him the potential for the abuse of power. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=595.38s)]
*  I mean, I don't think he's abusing power. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=601.62s)]
*  I think power is just in general being abused. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=603.66s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=605.9399999999999s)]
*  Just like, you know, we've seen it, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=607.3s)]
*  whether it's Justin or it was, you know, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=608.9s)]
*  Boris Johnson, Cindy Arden or Joe Biden. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=611.86s)]
*  Couldn't agree more. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=615.4599999999999s)]
*  Power tends to be abused by its nature. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=617.3000000000001s)]
*  And by, and centralized systems over time, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=620.3000000000001s)]
*  the further centralized they get, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=623.46s)]
*  the more secretive and corrupt they become as well. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=624.74s)]
*  Amen. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=626.6600000000001s)]
*  Now you're speaking my language, Kyle. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=627.86s)]
*  I totally agree with you. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=629.14s)]
*  So when the Vax thing happened [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=630.02s)]
*  and your brother starts saying things like, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  anyone who hasn't taken it is dirty [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=636.58s)]
*  and you should have a right not to be physically near [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=638.1s)]
*  a dirty, unvaccinated person. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=640.5s)]
*  You say that was stuff from the, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=643.5s)]
*  that not from his heart, but from the teleprompter. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=645.26s)]
*  Who do you think was putting it in the teleprompter? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=646.98s)]
*  Well, or it's like, as Matthias Desmond said, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=648.8199999999999s)]
*  like this mass formation psychosis, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=651.06s)]
*  when you have like everybody around him saying all this, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=653.06s)]
*  like, you know, it's like, you know, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=656.06s)]
*  what are his inputs? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=657.34s)]
*  Like Plato's cave, like if you're, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=659.1s)]
*  if everybody's always around you telling you [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=661.1s)]
*  how the world is, you know, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=663.58s)]
*  that's going to impact your worldview [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=664.7s)]
*  versus ourselves being open to, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=666.06s)]
*  having much more access to open information [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=669.18s)]
*  and, you know, actually listening to it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=672.14s)]
*  Like there's from, there's a point I really believe, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=675.58s)]
*  like there's good intentions, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=679.46s)]
*  but when counter information is presented, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=681.4200000000001s)]
*  it's like, don't want to hear it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=685.1s)]
*  And you, it threatens the worldview. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=686.82s)]
*  It's like, just give me the blue pill. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=689.3800000000001s)]
*  I'll just keep taking the pill. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=690.82s)]
*  That's totally right. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=692.1400000000001s)]
*  Like, no, don't want to know. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=693.22s)]
*  Cause I know, like, as if you recognize that there is, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=694.5400000000001s)]
*  you know, there are shadows [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=698.1s)]
*  and there are nefarious activities. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=699.4200000000001s)]
*  And there's, you know, that some of these warnings [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=701.3s)]
*  might have some credence and demand [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=705.02s)]
*  further investigation and justice, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=710.4599999999999s)]
*  then, you know, that's an, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=712.26s)]
*  can be an uncomfortable position to put yourself in. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=714.5799999999999s)]
*  So. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=717.5799999999999s)]
*  What, and thank you for mentioning, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=718.42s)]
*  Matthias Dismat wrote one of the great books [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=720.18s)]
*  in the last hundred years, in my opinion. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=722.5s)]
*  Well, and then, and by, and in that point, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=724.3399999999999s)]
*  what he said about, you know, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=726.6999999999999s)]
*  you can catalyze a group to really, you know, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=728.94s)]
*  hate another group. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=733.7s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=735.0600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, and Charles Eisenstein [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=735.9000000000001s)]
*  wrote an excellent article called Mob Morality [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=737.82s)]
*  and the Unvaxxed in which he made the case that, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=740.0200000000001s)]
*  you know, this group is being like relentlessly attacked. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=743.7800000000001s)]
*  And, you know, we saw a Toronto Star in Canada, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=747.3000000000001s)]
*  write a full like front page articles saying, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=750.86s)]
*  let them die. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=754.1800000000001s)]
*  It was just so hostile towards, you know, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=755.14s)]
*  those of us who chose said, no, you know what? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=758.62s)]
*  I'm not interested. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=761.98s)]
*  Not going to do this. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=763.34s)]
*  You don't have. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=764.62s)]
*  And they wished your death on you for that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=765.46s)]
*  And they would, and I mean, you know, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=767.14s)]
*  even Joe Biden said it's going to be, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=768.5s)]
*  what did he say, a winter of death or something, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=769.74s)]
*  something ridiculous along those lines. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=773.5s)]
*  Like the absurd pressure to take [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=775.14s)]
*  this experimental injection, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=780.18s)]
*  like I got suspended off Twitter [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=784.18s)]
*  for calling it a fake vaccine because like, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=785.54s)]
*  does it stop transmission? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=788.5s)]
*  Does it prevent infection? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=790.0999999999999s)]
*  Like, no, no, I can call it a vaccine. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=791.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=793.4599999999999s)]
*  So what, what did that mean for you? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=794.7399999999999s)]
*  Well, you probably got suspended [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=797.3s)]
*  because you're Justin Trudeau's brother too. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=798.3399999999999s)]
*  So you could. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=799.78s)]
*  It was a reply to his, one of his boasting tweets [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=800.62s)]
*  about, you know, how terrific it is [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=803.9399999999999s)]
*  that we've stuck 70 million people in the arm. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=806.78s)]
*  What did that mean for you and your family? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=812.26s)]
*  So you, you've got a sixth child, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=814.26s)]
*  the way you got a huge family. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=815.8199999999999s)]
*  You're from Canada. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=817.86s)]
*  Could you go back like during the COVID lockdowns? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=819.5799999999999s)]
*  So in the beginning it was very difficult. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=823.54s)]
*  And then there was this whole essential worker [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=826.5799999999999s)]
*  kind of scenario. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=828.9s)]
*  The border was just a nightmare. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=829.74s)]
*  And that's why I ended up getting this RV. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=831.54s)]
*  That's now a super awesome Kennedy bus. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=833.22s)]
*  And, you know, I drove around America, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=837.3s)]
*  drove from California up to Canada [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=840.42s)]
*  because, you know, the airports were unconscious. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=842.3s)]
*  And like, you know, when you're dealing with, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=844.9s)]
*  with agents in an airport and you've got your family [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=846.62s)]
*  and you have mixed nationalities within the family, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=848.9s)]
*  there's a chance you could, you know, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=851.62s)]
*  have a bad interaction and your family split up there. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=853.8199999999999s)]
*  And all of a sudden it's apart. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=856.4599999999999s)]
*  So, you know, just being, taking the pragmatic, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=857.86s)]
*  you know, intelligent approach, in my opinion, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=862.9799999999999s)]
*  I got an RV and I drove across the country. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=865.2199999999999s)]
*  And that also was super eye-opening [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=867.3s)]
*  because driving across America in, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=869.78s)]
*  what was that, June of 2020? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=872.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=874.26s)]
*  Really interesting. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=875.1s)]
*  California was very scared. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=876.18s)]
*  We got to Texas. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=878.54s)]
*  I was in the spring with like 3000 people. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=879.38s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=881.5799999999999s)]
*  It was like everything was fine. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=882.42s)]
*  It was great. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=883.26s)]
*  And then like, as we proceeded to get further, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=884.1s)]
*  closer to Ottawa, it's like, you know, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=886.1s)]
*  the level of fear, you could just feel it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=888.3s)]
*  And then it's once you got into Canada, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=890.18s)]
*  oh my God, it was, you're there 14 days, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=891.4599999999999s)]
*  pure isolation between coming in there and like, you know, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=896.06s)]
*  if you were in contact with other people in 14 days, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=900.3000000000001s)]
*  you could face up to six months in jail. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=903.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think it was a half a million dollar fine [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=905.4200000000001s)]
*  was threatening you with. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=907.46s)]
*  It's just insane what, you know, the levels. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=909.1s)]
*  And there's, and then when challenged on these topics, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=912.5400000000001s)]
*  and this is what the truckers did a lot of, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=916.62s)]
*  was like, can we talk about some of these general assumptions [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=918.38s)]
*  and these facts that you're stating behind [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=922.22s)]
*  why we're doing this? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=924.98s)]
*  They're met with, you know, hostility [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=927.78s)]
*  for asking simple questions. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=931.5799999999999s)]
*  Well, those questions were racist as I remember, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=933.06s)]
*  weren't they? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=934.98s)]
*  I don't, I would not say that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=935.8199999999999s)]
*  I think they're fair questions that desire, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=937.14s)]
*  desire honest, honest interactivity. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=939.5s)]
*  But this is the challenge about a myth. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=942.86s)]
*  It's like when you're, everything is based on a myth [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=945.3399999999999s)]
*  or based on a lie or false or a deceptive narrative. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=950.02s)]
*  You can't debate. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=955.8199999999999s)]
*  Instead, you must attack and enrage and censor [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=957.38s)]
*  and, you know, smear. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=961.06s)]
*  This was like the whole conspiracy theory. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=963.3s)]
*  Like, no, no, it's just conspiracy theory. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=965.34s)]
*  Don't talk about that. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=967.26s)]
*  I mean, you played a part in that like way back in the day [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=968.9s)]
*  as well, with just dismissing dismissing. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=971.78s)]
*  Oh, I used to dismiss a lot of things as conspiracy. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=973.9s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=976.46s)]
*  Remember, I believe you said it was blasphemous [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=977.5799999999999s)]
*  to question 9-11. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=979.9s)]
*  And like, you know. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=981.26s)]
*  I famously said that to Alex Jones's producers. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=982.1s)]
*  And I think I said it for the same, it was in 2012. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=986.22s)]
*  And I think I said it for the same reason [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=989.14s)]
*  that Matthias Desmet in your description described, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=991.38s)]
*  which is to admit that the things you thought were true [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=997.1800000000001s)]
*  might not be true or more complicated [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1000.5s)]
*  than you thought they were, kind of challenges [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1002.46s)]
*  your assumption about everything and that's scary. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1005.0600000000001s)]
*  And I just didn't want that. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1007.0600000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, by the time 2015 rolled around, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1009.5400000000001s)]
*  it was like absolutely impossible to deny [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1012.74s)]
*  that a lot of this was fake. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1013.86s)]
*  When everybody can also change too, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1015.3s)]
*  like based on information, like at some point, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1017.4599999999999s)]
*  you know, you can, anybody can forgive themselves for, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1022.22s)]
*  or can, yeah, can forgive themselves [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1025.66s)]
*  and apologize themselves for being deceived [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1027.78s)]
*  or, you know, having, you know, gone down a wrong path. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1030.62s)]
*  Like you can realize that something, you know, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1034.74s)]
*  actions that you've taken, you know, were misplaced. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1037.78s)]
*  And, you know, move forward in intention and integrity. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1042.7s)]
*  Of course. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1045.5s)]
*  And by the way, you can't have integrity [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1046.5s)]
*  if you don't do that. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1048.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1049.22s)]
*  You can't live with a lie. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1050.06s)]
*  You have to give it up by repenting. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1051.06s)]
*  So how were you treated in Canada? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1053.82s)]
*  How have you been treated in Canada [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1057.82s)]
*  since you're making a case that's, you know, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1059.66s)]
*  diametrically opposed to that of your brother? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1062.54s)]
*  Well, he referenced like the truckers [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1066.42s)]
*  as like a small fringe minority. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1068.54s)]
*  And I'll counter that. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1070.34s)]
*  I actually believe the liberals in the current government [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1071.34s)]
*  really represent a small fringe. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1074.26s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1076.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think the majority of Canadians are frustrated. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1077.3s)]
*  They're wondering why it's costing $45 [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1081.34s)]
*  for a platter of vegetables at the store. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1085.1399999999999s)]
*  I feel like they are, they're frustrated around, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1088.5s)]
*  you know, what took place, how two years of their lives [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1092.06s)]
*  were surrounded within so much fear [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1094.62s)]
*  and how it already was cut off. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1097.98s)]
*  And, you know, people I know, like personally, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1100.06s)]
*  some like, you know, when I started, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1104.34s)]
*  when I spoke up during the trucker thing [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1106.34s)]
*  and was like, you know, was really inspired by them. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1108.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was like 99 to one positive messages, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1113.62s)]
*  you know, to negative messages. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1117.9s)]
*  It's been overwhelmingly positive, you know, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1119.5s)]
*  the reaction and the sentiment. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1122.1s)]
*  And it just seems like, you know, real, like reality, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1124.46s)]
*  or like, you know, the primary interactions [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1128.18s)]
*  that I'm seeing with people versus like, you know, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1130.8600000000001s)]

*  And in talking to some of my friends in Ottawa, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1138.0600000000002s)]
*  like, you know, I asked them, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1140.3400000000001s)]
*  like, did you go down to Parliament Hill and engage? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1141.7s)]
*  Cause it seemed like, you know, it didn't seem, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1144.66s)]
*  it seemed like a, yes, it was like a demonstration, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1146.9s)]
*  but it also seemed like it was a party. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1148.74s)]
*  Seemed like for 17 days, Burning Man came to Ottawa. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1150.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1153.5s)]

*  In January. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1155.18s)]
*  In January, Freezing Man. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1156.0s)]
*  And crime was down. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1157.58s)]
*  Vibes were high. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1159.58s)]
*  People were looking out for each other. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1161.18s)]
*  There was communal effort. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1163.02s)]
*  They were participating. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1164.22s)]
*  There was so much gifting. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1165.18s)]
*  It was radically inclusive. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1166.22s)]
*  Like all the principles were on display. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1168.34s)]
*  But, you know, to those who didn't venture in there, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1170.74s)]
*  if they just watched the news, it was no, no, no. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1173.42s)]
*  This is like, you know, this is right. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1176.1399999999999s)]
*  Nazi conclave. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1178.06s)]
*  Nazis, they flew a Nazi flag. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1179.46s)]
*  And oh my God, it's the Nazis. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1182.18s)]
*  And that's like, you know, I feel like that flag was [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1184.34s)]
*  basically, what was the Reichstag all over again, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1188.8999999999999s)]
*  micro example of, you know, that plant. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1194.06s)]
*  And so there was this opportunity to engage with, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1197.1799999999998s)]
*  you know, these million people and the truckers, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1203.4199999999998s)]
*  but more than the truckers too. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1205.34s)]
*  Cause the truckers represented like, you know, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1206.58s)]
*  the heart of it, but then Canadians came out. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1208.5s)]
*  I talked to my friend, my friend Sonny, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1211.1399999999999s)]
*  he, you know, he went to go to an overpass [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1213.4199999999998s)]
*  and he had been, you know, isolated for over a year, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1216.6599999999999s)]
*  like with his family living in this bubble. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1220.98s)]
*  And when he, and like questioning things, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1223.26s)]
*  and then he went out to see the overpass [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1225.3799999999999s)]
*  and see all the truckers. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1226.8999999999999s)]
*  There were hundreds of people at this overpass. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1227.74s)]
*  And just like the energy of all those people [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1230.4199999999998s)]
*  was really inspiring. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1232.1799999999998s)]
*  And then he ended up going to Ottawa [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1233.94s)]
*  and being like, this is incredible. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1235.94s)]

*  versus what the media was painting it as, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1245.8600000000001s)]
*  were very different. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1248.9s)]
*  And unfortunately, you know, because based on a myth, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1250.42s)]
*  the government chose to enrage versus engage. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1254.14s)]
*  And, you know, and then following it, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1260.3400000000001s)]

*  They confiscated, you know, used legal tactics [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1280.26s)]
*  to lock up a lot of the donation funds [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1285.1s)]

*  It was, it's, and for me, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1323.26s)]
*  what was really kind of challenging out of this was [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1326.46s)]
*  if you bring a million people to Ottawa [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1329.9s)]

*  and, you know, a bunch of brutality. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1365.26s)]
*  And those were some of the images that really stuck [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1367.46s)]
*  because they didn't want the bouncy castle images [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1369.7s)]
*  to be, you know, what this thing was remembered. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1372.14s)]

*  That's one thing. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1386.3s)]
*  So instead they brought in the, you know, the security guards [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1387.58s)]
*  and they had a really ugly kind of, you know, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1390.4599999999998s)]
*  house cleaning to it. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1393.4199999999998s)]
*  And then they puny went after everybody. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1394.82s)]
*  So as Canadians, if you can't change [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1397.82s)]
*  or have a voice through a massive demonstration like that, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1404.4199999999998s)]
*  what methods do you have towards influencing [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1408.66s)]
*  or shifting radical policy? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1412.78s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1414.0600000000002s)]
*  So that now we're getting to the point, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1414.9s)]
*  which is if you take away peaceful democratic means [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1417.3000000000002s)]
*  of protest and change, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1420.94s)]
*  you leave people with only ugly options. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1422.74s)]
*  Well, or when you get pushed, it's like, you know, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1425.7s)]
*  what are we gonna do? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1430.3000000000002s)]
*  And I feel like, you know, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1431.22s)]
*  the world is full of amazing innovators. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1432.66s)]
*  And when you see this, it's like, okay, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1434.66s)]
*  protests aren't gonna work. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1436.74s)]
*  What else can we do? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1438.42s)]
*  Years 2024, we have unbelievable technologies [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1440.0600000000002s)]
*  that we've never had before. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1443.3400000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, like Bitcoin and crypto and blockchain [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1444.5s)]
*  and distributed ledger technology, internet. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1446.98s)]
*  If you look at the beginning, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1450.0200000000002s)]
*  the Westminster system of governance, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1451.42s)]
*  the US system of governance was invented in a time [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1453.5800000000002s)]
*  when you needed representatives from specific regions [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1457.2600000000002s)]
*  to go to Washington to represent that. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1460.7800000000002s)]
*  You didn't have the telegraph, you didn't have internet, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1463.5400000000002s)]
*  you didn't have communications abilities. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1466.18s)]
*  You needed a representative to go on behalf of your district, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1467.74s)]
*  your area, your state, whatever, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1472.1s)]
*  to go represent the interest. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1474.1s)]
*  Well, we're still using that system like 250 years later, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1476.14s)]
*  how many years later we are now, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1480.02s)]
*  but the conditions have changed. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1481.98s)]
*  We can have, we have FaceTime, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1483.26s)]
*  we can talk directly to somebody on the other side [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1484.54s)]
*  of the planet in high definition. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1487.54s)]
*  Maybe we should start looking at our governance systems [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1489.86s)]
*  and how we can upgrade those. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1493.1s)]
*  And like Russell Brand is always talking about [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1495.1s)]
*  how do we, you know, decentralize and allow people [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1497.14s)]
*  to have a little bit more input. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1500.18s)]
*  In Switzerland, it's a form of direct democracy. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1501.9s)]
*  If you as a citizen have an issue with something, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1505.5400000000002s)]
*  you go get 100,000 signatures [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1508.66s)]
*  and then the entire country will vote on it. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1511.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1514.22s)]
*  They'll be presented with a booklet that says [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1514.5s)]
*  why you should vote for this referendum [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1516.8200000000002s)]
*  and then the government's official position, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1520.3000000000002s)]
*  why you shouldn't vote for this. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1521.8200000000002s)]
*  And everybody gets this booklet. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1523.46s)]
*  So it's a very informed... [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1525.3000000000002s)]
*  We have multiple elections every year in Switzerland. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1527.06s)]
*  I think they have like three or four. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1528.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1530.3s)]
*  So I haven't asked you half an hour in [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1532.18s)]
*  about your contact with your brother. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1534.54s)]
*  So you have not just views that are different from him, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1536.54s)]
*  but like you've thought them through. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1539.26s)]
*  You believe them for a reason. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1540.82s)]
*  You probably have something to add. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1542.34s)]
*  Sounds like you do. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1544.54s)]
*  I think you do. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1545.38s)]
*  Did you call him at any point? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1546.58s)]
*  I did. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1548.14s)]
*  In the very beginning, I mean, I wanted to help out. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1548.98s)]
*  My family's got restaurants. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1551.66s)]
*  We had like the Clocktower Brewpubs in Ottawa. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1552.86s)]
*  And I thought, well, what can we do? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1555.34s)]
*  Can we do some food service? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1557.8999999999999s)]
*  How can we help the community towards in this [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1559.4199999999998s)]
*  dangerous time? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1562.78s)]
*  I wasn't really met with too much. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1565.26s)]
*  Obviously he himself, I think was also taking in [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1567.3s)]
*  so much different information. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1569.82s)]
*  And I wanted to help, wanted to help. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1571.1799999999998s)]
*  I remember a good friend reached out with [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1574.1s)]
*  a mushroom solution that was helping the cytokine storm [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1580.54s)]
*  and sent that his way and never got any kind of answers [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1584.1s)]
*  to it. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1587.62s)]
*  Just didn't seem like he was really looking [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1588.4599999999998s)]
*  for too much help. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1591.2199999999998s)]
*  And then like once the vaccine or the vaccine, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1592.26s)]
*  agenda became really clear. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1599.2199999999998s)]
*  That's when I was just like, hold on here. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1600.78s)]
*  I remember Mickey Willis put out PlanDemic One [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1604.3s)]
*  with Judy Mikovitch, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1607.3s)]
*  but then he put out PlanDemic Two in Dr. Nation, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1608.1399999999999s)]
*  which really detailed the Event 201 scenario [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1611.3s)]
*  where they basically role played [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1616.54s)]
*  how a global coronavirus pandemic should be handled [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1619.5s)]
*  by the corporatocracy in conjunction with government [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1623.1s)]
*  and media. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1627.58s)]
*  And they role played the whole thing two months before [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1628.62s)]
*  or three months before it all went live. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1633.46s)]
*  So I was very like, it's kind of skeptical once it started [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1636.02s)]
*  learning all that information. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1638.86s)]
*  And I could just see that Justin, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1640.6599999999999s)]
*  it wasn't gonna be there. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1643.82s)]
*  And the opportunity for open discourse about this, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1646.58s)]
*  I don't think he's really, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1651.5s)]
*  he wasn't really interested in my points of view [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1652.9399999999998s)]
*  on this topic. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1654.86s)]
*  Was he angry at you for expressing yours? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1656.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1660.9799999999998s)]
*  I mean, I hopefully in his heart of heart, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1663.1399999999999s)]
*  he's proud of being open and honest and speaking your truth. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1666.22s)]
*  I think this is critical. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1672.18s)]
*  I think this is the path forward. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1673.9s)]
*  And it's also admitting when you're wrong. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1676.18s)]
*  That's the acid test right there. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1681.0600000000002s)]
*  Can you admit when you were wrong? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1682.5800000000002s)]
*  Can you admit when you're wrong? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1683.66s)]
*  It's like, and apologizing, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1685.0200000000002s)]
*  but also like it's like with our children, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1687.8600000000001s)]
*  it's like, they'll say I'm sorry, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1690.18s)]
*  but they don't necessarily know why they're sorry sometimes. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1692.22s)]
*  And I'm sorry for hating you. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1695.9s)]
*  That's what, or for doing this, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1697.22s)]
*  but explaining to really understand what the problem was. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1699.94s)]
*  And like, there's this kind of, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1702.74s)]
*  this healing modality that needs to be embraced [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1705.7s)]
*  going forward. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1708.0200000000002s)]
*  Like, have you familiar with the Hawaiian healing phrase, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1709.26s)]
*  ho'oponopono? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1712.5400000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1713.7s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1714.5400000000002s)]
*  So it's a Hawaiian healing prayer [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  that's comprised of four lines. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1716.9s)]
*  I'm sorry, please forgive me. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1718.7s)]
*  I'm grateful or thankful. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1721.74s)]
*  And I love you. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1723.74s)]
*  And you can say these four lines to yourself first. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1724.86s)]
*  And like, apologize to yourself [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1727.78s)]
*  for those things that you did. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1729.9399999999998s)]
*  Find a place to forgive yourself [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1732.02s)]
*  for the things that you did. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1734.02s)]
*  Be grateful and thankful to yourself [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1735.34s)]
*  and also love yourself. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1737.98s)]
*  Like, really critical. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1739.86s)]
*  But then you can also use this with other people. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1741.22s)]
*  So I said this to my mother, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1743.3s)]
*  because I know like, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1744.6599999999999s)]
*  what I was doing was hurting, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1745.6999999999998s)]
*  like was causing energy. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1747.4199999999998s)]
*  So, and I say this to Justin too, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1749.34s)]
*  like, I'm sorry. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1751.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry for any harm that I've caused [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1753.66s)]
*  or if my words have negatively impacted your life. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1755.5400000000002s)]
*  Please forgive me. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1758.38s)]
*  I'm just trying to speak my truth [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1759.22s)]

*  and that I love you, like in my heart of hearts. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1769.26s)]
*  And this ho'oponopono message is something [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1771.6200000000001s)]
*  that I think we can take out there [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1774.5800000000002s)]
*  and you can really heal a lot. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1776.14s)]
*  And we live in a very divided civilization right now. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1777.94s)]
*  We're more than just a country. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1782.42s)]
*  Like in America, it's very divided. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1783.42s)]
*  And this is one of Bobby's messages. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1784.78s)]
*  Like how do we heal the divide? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1785.98s)]
*  How do we bring people together? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1787.3000000000002s)]
*  Because we have been so polarized [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1788.42s)]
*  and it's easy to like, you know, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1790.38s)]
*  and I feel like it's by design, it's divide and conquer. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1791.78s)]
*  Of course. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1794.18s)]
*  People just like, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1795.02s)]
*  how many different identity buckets can you get them in? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1795.8600000000001s)]
*  And then when they're all fighting each other, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1798.22s)]
*  it's like, you know, it's easy to control. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1799.66s)]
*  Versus like if we can actually heal [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1802.6200000000001s)]
*  and start working together and having open, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1804.42s)]
*  honest discourse and respecting the differences [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1806.3000000000002s)]
*  of the opinion that we all might have and share. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1808.94s)]
*  But you know, it's imperative that we're able [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1812.1s)]
*  to have open, honest discussion without being able to, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1815.62s)]
*  you know, retreat or censor or attack or smear [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1820.4199999999998s)]
*  or guilt by association or use single words [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1824.26s)]
*  like conspiracy theory to just dismiss very valid, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1827.5s)]
*  very valid points that require investigation. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1831.1s)]
*  Right. I mean, you have to be honest enough [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1833.4199999999998s)]
*  to assess things on their own terms. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1835.1799999999998s)]
*  Even if somebody you don't want to hear, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1836.78s)]
*  the first question you have to ask, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1838.26s)]
*  it's your moral obligation to ask is, is it true? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1839.94s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1842.5s)]
*  You know, you say to me, you're a bad driver. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1843.78s)]
*  Well, I don't want to be a bad driver, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1845.9s)]
*  but I have to ask myself like, am I a bad driver? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1847.14s)]
*  Right? Right. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1850.26s)]
*  Right. You have to be honest. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1851.46s)]
*  So you mentioned apologizing to your mom, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1852.66s)]
*  who I should say for people who aren't Canadian, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1854.8200000000002s)]
*  is like a very famous person in Canada, of course. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1856.14s)]
*  Margaret Trudeau, famous. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1858.74s)]
*  Amazing. Love you, mama. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1860.14s)]
*  What, I mean, what's her view of all this stuff? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1861.7s)]
*  Got two sons on different sides. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1865.3s)]
*  I think, you know, she is very proud of Justin [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1870.18s)]
*  and all that he's done. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1875.38s)]
*  So, and I think I've always been, you know, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1876.66s)]
*  a little bit on the outside, let's say, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1879.94s)]
*  maybe the black sheep of the family a little bit with, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1882.3s)]
*  you know, the questions and the topics of discussions [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1885.3s)]
*  and the debates that I would like to engage in. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1888.26s)]
*  Like about what? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1890.66s)]
*  About many different things about like, you know, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1892.26s)]
*  you had Ron Paul on here. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1894.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1895.5s)]
*  Like a lot of the lessons of, it's a good doctor. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1896.3400000000001s)]
*  The Federal Reserve, looking at that, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1899.78s)]
*  looking at blowback, looking at foreign policy. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1901.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1903.82s)]
*  Like right now, Canada, Justin said repeatedly, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1904.66s)]
*  we're in this till the end, until victory. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1908.7s)]
*  It's like, come on, what does that look like? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1911.6200000000001s)]
*  How can we do that? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1913.98s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1915.8600000000001s)]
*  What exactly? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1916.8600000000001s)]
*  It's just, it never ends. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1917.7s)]
*  Like, what is the condition? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1919.8600000000001s)]
*  Why aren't we, until the victory, how about peace? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1921.66s)]
*  How about diplomacy? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1925.5s)]
*  How, like the war, like pushing for war, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1927.38s)]
*  very, very dangerous, especially with our neighbors. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1931.0200000000002s)]
*  Like Russia is a neighbor to Canada. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1934.8200000000002s)]
*  It's just right there. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1937.2600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1938.14s)]
*  On the other side. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1938.98s)]
*  It's like, why, we don't want to, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1939.8200000000002s)]
*  what's the point of this? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1940.98s)]
*  Do you know the answer? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1943.0200000000002s)]
*  I don't know the answer. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1943.9s)]
*  What do you think the answer is? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1944.74s)]
*  What is the point? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1945.74s)]
*  Well, I think it's a global proxy war [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1947.5800000000002s)]
*  for the corporatocracy to further transfer wealth [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1950.42s)]
*  from sovereign individuals into the coffers [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1953.78s)]
*  of the global corporation. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1957.34s)]
*  I think that's a good guess. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1960.14s)]
*  I mean, it's like Henry Perkins, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1962.02s)]
*  like, you know, he wrote the confessions [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1963.9s)]
*  of an economic hitman, kind of shows like, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1965.38s)]
*  when we're giving $80 million or $80 billion in US dollars [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1967.26s)]
*  or whatever the number is to Ukraine, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1972.46s)]
*  like you think that money is like a palette [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1974.5s)]
*  that's going to go into Ukraine? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1975.98s)]
*  Like, no, it's there, it's, here's money for you [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1977.94s)]
*  to spend on our things. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1980.86s)]
*  So you've made reference to prayer [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1984.7s)]
*  and you've sort of revealed a worldview [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1988.74s)]
*  that is spiritual on some level. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1991.74s)]
*  Canada seems very aggressively hostile to Christianity, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1994.78s)]
*  for example, and spirituality. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=1999.34s)]
*  And that seems like a new thing. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2001.78s)]
*  All these church burnings, for example, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2003.14s)]
*  take place across your country. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2004.82s)]
*  Some government officials, including your brother, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2006.9s)]
*  seem to not have a problem with that. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2008.7s)]
*  Like, what's your view of the role of spirituality [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2010.46s)]
*  and what's happening right now? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2014.58s)]
*  Well, there were a lot of pastors too, you know, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2017.6200000000001s)]
*  who stood up. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2020.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2021.9s)]
*  And went to jail, and like, you know, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2022.74s)]
*  and who were subjugated and punished. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2024.46s)]
*  So if you're cheering church burnings [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2026.74s)]
*  and throwing pastors in jail, like, what side are you on? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2028.58s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2031.3400000000001s)]
*  I think you're on Satan's team, honestly. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2032.8600000000001s)]
*  That's what I actually think, since you asked. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2034.54s)]
*  Well, no, it feels like [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2036.98s)]
*  there's some dark energies out there. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2040.22s)]

*  Like when my wife Brittany and I were in Canada in 2020, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2051.74s)]
*  you know, she was pregnant. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2056.5s)]
*  She got chased out of a grocery store. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2058.34s)]
*  Why? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2061.7799999999997s)]
*  Not wearing a mask. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2062.62s)]
*  She was super pregnant. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2063.46s)]
*  And like, you know, we're just, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2064.7799999999997s)]

*  I couldn't, I was just not having it. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2068.5s)]
*  And, you know, but for people to be, to like, you know, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2071.94s)]
*  to get to that level of, you know, animosity [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2075.94s)]
*  and hate towards someone for not kind of complying, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2082.22s)]
*  it's really scary that you got to that state. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2084.98s)]
*  And- [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2089.38s)]
*  Chasing a pregnant lady out of a grocery store? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2090.22s)]
*  Chasing a pregnant lady out of a grocery store. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2092.46s)]
*  Triggering a miscarriage. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2096.06s)]
*  That's just absolutely beyond. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2099.5s)]

*  Beautiful country, just like America. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2118.38s)]
*  I mean, I've been so blessed to be all over America. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2120.02s)]
*  And like, you know, and for the last eight months, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2123.94s)]
*  I've been driving my Kennedy bus all over America too, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2127.3s)]

*  beautiful hearts all over. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2142.98s)]

*  There's some people that like seek to deceive [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2145.78s)]
*  and cause chaos and might quite frankly be evil. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2147.9s)]
*  But, you know, we just, I personally, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2151.82s)]

*  Don't make assumptions. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2164.5s)]

*  Amen. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2168.42s)]

*  you grew up in Canada and then you get to, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2171.7s)]
*  you know, 30 years later, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2174.2999999999997s)]
*  your pregnant wife is being chased out of a grocery store. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2175.5s)]
*  Like, how did that happen? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2178.5s)]
*  How did we, because it didn't just, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2179.54s)]
*  I mean, it came to a head during COVID [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2181.18s)]
*  and the trucker protest, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2183.3399999999997s)]
*  but these things build over years. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2185.06s)]
*  Did you see it coming? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2187.42s)]
*  Did you know that the country was changing [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2189.2999999999997s)]
*  from a free place to a totalitarian place [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2191.62s)]
*  or a mob rules place? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2194.1s)]
*  I mean, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2200.18s)]
*  there's definitely warning signs that, you know, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2204.66s)]
*  these are going, like my trust in the media, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2207.82s)]
*  especially the Canadian media, like, you know, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2211.46s)]
*  we know the American media, you know, being, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2213.7s)]
*  especially yourself, but the Canadian media is like, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2216.18s)]
*  kind of like a special type of, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2218.7799999999997s)]
*  like hypnotic, deceptive. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2224.66s)]
*  Like there isn't so much like a real left right. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2227.18s)]
*  It's kind of all just the same melange of like, you know, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2230.58s)]
*  here's what you believe, what you should think. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2234.2599999999998s)]
*  And a lot of what should be objective reporting [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2238.66s)]
*  is presented with [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2242.82s)]
*  careful subjectivity. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2248.98s)]
*  It sort of marinates in propaganda. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2251.6200000000003s)]
*  I remember seeing Hockey Night in Canada, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2253.1800000000003s)]
*  a broadcast of it. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2256.54s)]
*  And I was really struck, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2257.6200000000003s)]
*  not just by the high level of play on the ice, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2259.7400000000002s)]
*  but by the propaganda slogans everywhere around the rink. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2262.1400000000003s)]
*  That had nothing to do with selling anything. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2266.1800000000003s)]
*  It was selling ideas about Canada. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2268.06s)]
*  And I thought, wow, that's like 1984 stuff. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2271.26s)]
*  And then, and I mean, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2275.6200000000003s)]
*  and then look like when the COVID scenario took place too, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2276.98s)]
*  it's like, you don't shut down the hockey. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2280.3s)]
*  You don't shut down the gladiator sports. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2283.7000000000003s)]
*  You need to keep, you know, people still doing that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2285.86s)]
*  So they just enacted the bubbles and then, you know, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2288.34s)]
*  and then they spin in all of a sudden, like the, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2291.5s)]
*  the propaganda influence starts getting through [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2295.9s)]
*  and through into the sport, which is already there, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2298.5s)]
*  but it becomes a little bit more in your face. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2300.54s)]
*  And, you know, people aren't, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2302.86s)]
*  there's no, there's no fans in the stadiums here. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2306.9s)]
*  It was like, but they kept playing, you know, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2310.86s)]
*  so that people could still have their sport [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2313.78s)]
*  and still have their entertainment there. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2315.78s)]
*  How did you wind up so different from your brother? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2317.6600000000003s)]

*  and from my friends and through experiences [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2331.14s)]

*  And then like, there was a certain point in like, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2404.78s)]
*  you know, 2015, 2016, that like a lot of the Burning Man [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2407.26s)]
*  kind of community started getting really into this, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2411.58s)]
*  into this space too. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2414.46s)]
*  So, you know, and there was like cross-pollination [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2415.58s)]
*  of information and, you know, a lot of the principles [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2418.06s)]
*  out of that were very, you know, eye-opening as well. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2421.98s)]
*  And, you know, and I've spent a lot of time [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2425.66s)]
*  in California as well. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2428.22s)]
*  And coming from Ottawa, which is, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2429.62s)]
*  I'd say it's a conservative city. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2433.14s)]
*  It's a government town, but it's a conservative town. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2434.5s)]
*  You know, as an entrepreneur, as an innovator there, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2437.8199999999997s)]
*  and as a creative, a lot of times, you know, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2440.14s)]
*  the first reaction is to say no to an idea. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2444.14s)]
*  No, no, that's not gonna work because of this, that, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2448.5s)]
*  the other, but you go to California and like, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2450.54s)]
*  and being in this very innovative kind of environments [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2453.74s)]
*  and the action is yes, like, here's how we can do it. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2456.2999999999997s)]
*  And it's like the kind of the American spirit, right? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2458.7s)]
*  It's like, yes, yes, we can, let's build, let's create. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2461.18s)]
*  And let's challenge and not just believe [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2464.5s)]
*  that you can't do something because, you know, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2467.2999999999997s)]
*  it might not work. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2469.1s)]
*  It's like, you know, you gotta open yourself [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2470.9s)]
*  up to some vulnerability and try [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2471.74s)]
*  because you're never gonna succeed if you don't try. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2473.74s)]
*  So at least try. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2477.62s)]
*  It's like Bobby, you know, he's freaking doing it. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2478.78s)]
*  Going for the presidency, you show some courage doing that. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2481.58s)]
*  I'm behind you as well. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2484.42s)]
*  Let's try this. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2486.34s)]
*  We don't know what's gonna happen. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2487.2599999999998s)]
*  People will tell you they know what's gonna happen. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2489.18s)]
*  Nobody knows what's gonna happen. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2491.5s)]
*  That's true. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2492.86s)]
*  So why not give it your best? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2493.7s)]
*  And it's like, you know, and recognize that [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2495.2599999999998s)]
*  if you don't like the status, it's like the Switzerland. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2497.1s)]
*  You don't like that law. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2499.66s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2501.14s)]
*  Get up, go out, get a hundred thousand signatures [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2501.98s)]
*  and then everybody votes on it. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2505.06s)]
*  Is there any chance that that happens in Canada? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2506.2999999999997s)]
*  There's no recourse. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2509.5s)]
*  And this was one of the issues out of the trucker thing [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2510.7799999999997s)]
*  is what can you do? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2515.3799999999997s)]
*  Can you have a referendum? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2516.42s)]
*  To do a referendum and many people looked into it [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2517.8999999999996s)]
*  and you need a support of a sitting MP. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2520.18s)]
*  And many of them aren't kind of willing to do that. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2524.46s)]
*  So there's no like direct ability to participate. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2527.38s)]
*  And Justin said, if you wanna make a difference, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2534.1800000000003s)]
*  if you don't like these policies, well, get out and vote. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2539.6600000000003s)]
*  Get out and vote. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2542.7400000000002s)]
*  And that's how you can show it. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2544.1800000000003s)]
*  It's like, well, you know, going out every four years [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2545.42s)]
*  or five years in the case of Canada or two, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2548.94s)]
*  I don't know, it kind of switches up all the time. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2551.58s)]
*  But going out and making one mark on a piece of paper [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2553.38s)]
*  and declaring that democracy, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2557.6600000000003s)]
*  I just think that's a little bit short-sighted. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2560.9s)]
*  It's not really civic engagement. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2563.26s)]
*  Could you ever imagine moving back there? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2567.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2570.62s)]
*  I think Canada can win a Stanley Cup at one point too. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2572.1s)]
*  You need to fix the tax system. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2574.9s)]
*  Would that be an inducement to move back? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2579.7000000000003s)]
*  The tax system? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2582.66s)]
*  No, the Stanley Cup. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2583.5s)]
*  No, I think if the tax system were fixed, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2584.58s)]
*  that would be a great inducement for many people [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2586.62s)]
*  to move back to Canada. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2590.7s)]
*  The current system encourages successful people to leave. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2592.42s)]
*  Offshore their money. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2597.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not a culture of celebrating achievement [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2601.06s)]
*  and value creation. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2606.8999999999996s)]
*  No, it's a culture of crushing the different. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2609.18s)]
*  Taxing and rules, rules, more laws, regulations, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2613.38s)]
*  bylaw, provincial, federal, just keep on adding. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2622.2599999999998s)]
*  And there's a challenge in repealing these [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2627.74s)]
*  or cleaning it up. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2632.2599999999998s)]
*  So I feel like we're at the point where, what can you do? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2634.02s)]
*  What can you do? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2638.58s)]
*  And like I mentioned before, the systems have changed. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2639.42s)]
*  So I think it's time for an open conversation [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2642.06s)]
*  about how things can change. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2644.82s)]
*  And like I said, Pierre Poliev came to this conference [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2647.62s)]
*  that I held in Ottawa and talked about Switzerland [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2651.22s)]
*  and how referendums happened there [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2653.34s)]
*  and how blockchain could be able to use that. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2655.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, I would love to see him expand more on that [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2657.46s)]
*  and to explore in Canada, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2662.06s)]
*  how we can have a more involved population [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2663.62s)]
*  when it comes to being integrated in decisions. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2669.62s)]
*  Because the way the party system works [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2674.8599999999997s)]
*  is like they've got the whip, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2677.42s)]
*  that word goes back a ways, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2680.02s)]
*  that they use their whip and all people within the party [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2682.5s)]
*  just have to vote according to the party's dictate. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2685.7s)]
*  And that doesn't represent the people. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2689.9s)]
*  And honestly, so many politicians get elected [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2694.62s)]
*  as representatives for a given space on certain promises, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2697.74s)]
*  but then there's no accountability [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2701.9799999999996s)]
*  to uphold those promises. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2705.54s)]
*  And if you don't fall through with them, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2711.06s)]
*  there's nothing you can do. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2715.9399999999996s)]
*  Technically in the States, there's a recall process. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2717.54s)]
*  In Canada, there really isn't a recall process. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2719.8599999999997s)]
*  Do you think your brother will get reelected? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2721.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't think he wants to, but. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2724.06s)]
*  You don't think he wants to get reelected? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2726.06s)]
*  I mean, I don't think he, I don't think, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2727.62s)]
*  I mean personally, I don't know, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2729.98s)]
*  I just think some of the latest stuff, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2730.86s)]
*  and it's just really sad, like, you know, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2732.54s)]
*  that's not a way to live. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2734.58s)]
*  You know, when I'm out here fighting for freedom [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2736.14s)]
*  and like, you know, speaking for freedom and liberty, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2738.98s)]
*  well, Justin is not a free man. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2741.58s)]
*  Like, you know, he has, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2743.98s)]
*  they just showed him trying to go to an event [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2746.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know, a couple of days ago, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2749.14s)]
*  and there were probably like 50 cops, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2750.18s)]
*  like, you know, as his escort, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2752.74s)]
*  because Canadians are pissed off. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2754.22s)]
*  It's angry out there, folks. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2756.18s)]
*  It's not a good look. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2758.58s)]
*  He can't drive a car. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2760.02s)]
*  Like, he can't go to a restaurant. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2761.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, when you make a big sacrifice [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2762.8199999999997s)]
*  when you enter into that public arena, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2764.5s)]
*  and you know, and he has entered that public arena, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2767.8599999999997s)]
*  and in the beginning, it was all in a sunshine and rainbows, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2770.2599999999998s)]
*  but now it's dark and there's a lot of negative energy, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2775.3799999999997s)]
*  and to all the people that really are putting [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2778.2599999999998s)]
*  that negative energy on Justin, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2780.3799999999997s)]
*  just recognize like, you know, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2782.46s)]
*  Justin's like the captain of the hockey team. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2785.18s)]
*  He's not the manager of it. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2788.7400000000002s)]
*  He's not the owner of it. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2790.94s)]
*  Who do you think the owner is? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2792.42s)]
*  Who do you think the owner is? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2794.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2795.26s)]
*  You have a pretty good idea. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2796.58s)]
*  I mean, I personally think there's a spiritual component [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2798.3s)]
*  to all of this, so there's maybe the supreme leader of it, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2801.82s)]
*  but I assume business interests are involved. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2804.82s)]
*  Business interests, yeah. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2808.18s)]
*  I use the word the corporatocracy. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2810.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2812.46s)]
*  Like, you know, their profits, you know, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2813.3s)]
*  come from, like, you know, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2818.5s)]
*  look at the pharmaceutical industry. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2819.98s)]
*  Like, and the profits reaped out of, you know, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2821.62s)]
*  the COVID scenario, you know, it's just one example, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2824.94s)]
*  or the military industrial complex, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2828.82s)]
*  and the money and the profits reaped out of war, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2830.6600000000003s)]
*  and you can- [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2834.98s)]
*  But Canada's gotten so much poorer. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2836.26s)]
*  I didn't go for a few years because of COVID, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2838.2200000000003s)]
*  and we were just there this winter, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2840.14s)]
*  and it's a poorer country. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2841.94s)]
*  It's just much more expensive, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2843.54s)]
*  and people's standard of living is dropping. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2845.18s)]
*  I think that's fair to say, right? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2847.46s)]
*  So how could- [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2849.3799999999997s)]
*  Seems like it. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2850.22s)]
*  How could, well, it's also true in the United States. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2851.06s)]
*  How could leaders, when their own country's getting poorer, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2853.3799999999997s)]
*  send all this money to a war across the world [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2856.8199999999997s)]
*  that has no benefit to them at all? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2860.74s)]
*  That's a great question for them. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2865.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2867.7799999999997s)]
*  Like, how, why? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2868.62s)]
*  Why would you do this? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2869.9s)]
*  Why would you do it for Canadians? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2870.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, we're gonna create a new food program, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2871.58s)]
*  or we're gonna create more programs, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2873.3s)]
*  more programs, more programs. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2875.34s)]
*  Look at root spending, folks. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2876.94s)]
*  And like, look at the taxation situation. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2879.06s)]
*  Like, you're taxed, and you're taxed, and you're taxed. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2881.14s)]
*  You're getting taxed on the money that you're being taxed on. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2883.3s)]
*  Like, you know, what you have left is very little. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2885.82s)]
*  And then you look at the cost of housing, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2888.82s)]
*  the cost of living. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2891.66s)]
*  It's unsustainable. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2893.98s)]
*  And then there's also like, you know, a culture I saw, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2896.46s)]
*  an article, you know, it's kind of like explaining like, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2900.1400000000003s)]
*  wow, there's like, you know, over 100,000 people [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2902.7400000000002s)]
*  in the government making more than $100,000 a year. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2906.9s)]
*  And it's like, well, I mean, when you factor in inflation, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2910.0600000000004s)]
*  like $100,000 is not what it used to be. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2912.7400000000002s)]
*  Like, you're basically, if you've got a family, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2915.34s)]
*  like, you're not thriving at $100,000 a year. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2918.42s)]
*  Like, and same in America. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2922.26s)]
*  And they want to, you know, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2923.86s)]
*  I spent a lot of time working in the financial industry, too. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2926.0600000000004s)]
*  It used to be like, you know, remember the $10,000, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2928.38s)]
*  you have more than $10,000 in cash? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2931.34s)]
*  Well, it's been that way for like 50 years, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2932.98s)]
*  $10,000 in cash. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2934.82s)]
*  And now they're trying to bring it down [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2936.46s)]
*  to even lower numbers. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2937.54s)]
*  Like anytime there's transaction or $600, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2938.5s)]
*  they want to know, which is really dangerous. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2941.06s)]
*  So, you know, when you have this financial oversight [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2942.86s)]
*  combined with the fact that people don't have any money, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2946.7000000000003s)]
*  and then, you know, then there's also this element, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2949.98s)]
*  there's like a UBI kind of gentle play [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2953.02s)]
*  that was kind of introduced as well [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2955.2200000000003s)]
*  with, you know, the checks were written in Canada [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2956.78s)]
*  for like $4,000 for every Canadian, just. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2960.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's UBI. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2963.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's UBI. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2964.26s)]
*  And it's just blanket giving out. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2966.1000000000004s)]
*  It's not like there was like a requesting. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2967.6200000000003s)]
*  When people like, who are like desperately needing help, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2969.5400000000004s)]
*  have a way to ask for help. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2972.6600000000003s)]
*  Now it's just like, blanket welfare, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2974.6600000000003s)]
*  really inefficient, ineffective system. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2977.38s)]
*  And ultimately it is going to drive more inflation, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2979.38s)]
*  which will drive higher costs for everybody. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2983.02s)]
*  Well, it's quite effective that way. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2984.82s)]
*  If you want to make people totally dependent [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2987.42s)]
*  on the people in power, that's what you do. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2989.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2994.18s)]
*  So you said you think your brother wants to get out. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2995.34s)]
*  What do you, my final question, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2997.62s)]
*  what do you think he will do when he gets out? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=2999.06s)]
*  And what do you think he should do when he gets out? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3001.62s)]
*  I mean, if you think about like, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3007.58s)]
*  what did like Bill Clinton do when he got out? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3008.62s)]
*  It's like, I'm gonna go on speaking tour. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3010.9s)]
*  I'm like, you know, go sit on boards [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3013.2200000000003s)]
*  and do things like that. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3015.02s)]
*  You can probably do that. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3017.46s)]
*  You know, I think there's some, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3020.14s)]
*  he's got to ultimately decide what he's gonna do. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3022.02s)]
*  I would say start with ho'oponopono. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3024.46s)]
*  Like that's a good place to start. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3026.54s)]
*  With the Hawaiian prayer. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3029.18s)]
*  With the Hawaiian prayer. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3030.18s)]
*  Say your sorry. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3031.78s)]
*  Say your sorry, apologize, ask for forgiveness, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3033.3s)]
*  but tell people why you're sorry too. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3036.14s)]
*  Come clean. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3038.06s)]
*  If there's stuff, I'm sure there's some stuff. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3038.9s)]
*  Like, you know, just, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3040.62s)]
*  repent if you will, and move forward in a good path. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3045.58s)]
*  Do the best you can because, you know, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-jWexNK2U4&t=3051.66s)]
