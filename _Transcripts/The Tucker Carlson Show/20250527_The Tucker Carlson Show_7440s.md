# Mike Benz: How NGOs Have Dominated the World, Who’s Behind Them, & How They’re Now Undermining Trump
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E)
*  The US Institute of Peace was, think of it like the National Endowment for Democracy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=0.0s)]
*  Is George Orwell in charge of naming these groups? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4.4s)]
*  National Endowment for Democracy subverts democracy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6.8s)]
*  All these peace groups are like aggressively anti-peace. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=9.28s)]
*  You can check out these protests online. They're hilarious. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=12.56s)]
*  It's people protesting in the streets so that they are not allowed to know foreign funding of their own societies. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=14.8s)]
*  Put the blindfolders on me. I'm not allowed to know whether that is funded by a foreign government. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=22.56s)]
*  How much is funding? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=27.44s)]
*  The CIA was running an initiative to control the education space during the Cold War [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=28.4s)]
*  to stop the spread of communist sympathizing teachings and curricula. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=34.8s)]
*  All this was repurposed against right-wing populism when Trump won in 2016. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=39.04s)]
*  I noticed, according to George Soros, the Open Society Foundation was to provide a basically a tax loophole for his kids. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=43.36s)]
*  It became such a powerful force in Washington that we had to synchronize US foreign policy [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=49.76s)]
*  with the foreign policy set out by the Open Society Foundation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=56.4s)]
*  NGOs. You hear the term all the time. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=59.76s)]
*  In fact, the deeper you look into almost any news story, especially one that pertains to the destruction of Western civilization in the United States, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=82.72s)]
*  you find something called an NGO at the bottom of the story. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=92.0s)]
*  NGO stands for non-governmental organization, but paradoxically, NGOs feel like a parallel government to me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=96.0s)]
*  You've done a lot of research on this. I don't think this topic is talked about enough. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=104.88s)]
*  I'm just going to stand back and let you explain what an NGO is, where they came from, and what role they occupy in the modern West. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=107.92s)]
*  Yeah. NGOs are the stem cell of the government's central nervous system. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=117.28s)]
*  They are this highly flexible tool, just like a stem cell can transform into any of the 220 different cell types in the human body. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=123.36s)]
*  They self-renew and they can generate all these new neurons. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=133.04s)]
*  You can't disentangle or really separate the government from the non-governmental organizations. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  This started in its origin with the creation of the US income tax in 1913. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=145.44s)]
*  Then in 1917, contributions to charitable organizations, to 501c3s as we now know it, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=153.68s)]
*  became tax deductible from this new income tax. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=162.88s)]
*  That gave rise to this money flow into private foundations and into non-profit organizations [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=168.16s)]
*  that would come to play a large role in both World Wars, but in particular World War II, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=176.88s)]
*  when humanitarian relief began to be a big part of OSS and the predecessor to the CIA [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=182.8s)]
*  and military financial assistance to groups afflicted by World War II. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=191.92s)]
*  Then in particular during the Marshall Plan after World War II, NGOs played a key role in being a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=200.4s)]
*  deniable front to run money, to establish contacts, and to provide direction and guidance [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=207.76s)]
*  to groups that the US government did not want to be caught necessarily doing directly. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=215.84s)]
*  So you can trace this back really. You have all these charities. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  They were fronts, a lot of them, or at least in part. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  So it's a complicated relationship because you have government agencies and then you have outside [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=228.39999999999998s)]
*  high net worth individuals and families, dynastic American families like the Fords, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=236.32s)]
*  the Rockefellers, the Carnegie's, all starting these private philanthropies, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  all playing a role in US statecraft, all having international businesses that rely on foreign [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  markets. So they're highly dependent on the State Department clearing the way for them, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  negotiating deals for them, acquiring territory, creating export markets, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=259.52s)]
*  maintaining laws in foreign countries that maximize profitability, securing mining rights, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=265.52s)]
*  securing trade routes. So there's this complex interplay. This is why I always call, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  so the story is really about, I don't really think of it as a government being different than an NGO, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=277.28s)]
*  as being different than this corporate financial overclass. When I use the term the blob, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=284.16s)]
*  which is not my term, that was a term from Obama's deputy national security advisor, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  Ben Rhodes, to describe a force within Washington that was bigger than the White House, that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  the Obama White House felt like it couldn't get its foreign policy done because this foreign policy [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  establishment, this blob structure seemed to be more powerful than that. But I think of the blob [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=306.88s)]
*  as having three levels to it. You have the guts of it inside the government, which is the State [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=312.24s)]
*  Department, the Defense Department, the intelligence community, and USAID. You can think of it, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=320.16s)]
*  Hillary Clinton would call this the 3D model, diplomacy, defense, and development. And then [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=326.56s)]
*  the IC plays, the CIA, for example, plays a supporting role in those functions. And these [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=332.48s)]
*  are all merged together as one cohesive way of advancing US foreign policy, is what we call it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=339.04s)]
*  But it's really advancing the interests of, generally speaking, insiders or national champions [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=344.88s)]
*  like our large multinational corporations. But bring this back, so you have this government [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=352.72s)]
*  structure in the center of it. And then below that, you have the NGOs who are funded by the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  US government and who work alongside the US government and have a longer reach than the US [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=364.0s)]
*  government. The State Department can't just walk into certain conflict zones and talk to the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=368.88s)]
*  indigenous community and get honest answers or tell them what to do without being on the record [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  saying something they might not want attributed to them. The NGOs can go in and do that. The NGOs [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  can serve as the back channels for diplomacy. The NGOs can provide a plausible way of providing [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=387.12s)]
*  financial assistance or money or bribes to various groups, to run shipments and arms, and to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=392.88s)]
*  create networks of assets that then an Assistant Secretary of State can then liaise with. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=403.28s)]
*  So there's this network creation level and there's this influence level at the bottom. But above that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=410.88s)]
*  government level is what I call the donor drafter class, which is, everyone understands the concept [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  of big donors having a big influence on politics. Not only do they largely play the key role in [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  determining who's president through the funding that they provide, but I say donor drafter because [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  they draft off the policies off of the US government. They don't just donate into it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=441.68s)]
*  Like in a bike race, you always want to be not in first. You want to be right behind the guy in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=446.88s)]
*  first so that the guy in first is cutting the wind for you so that you don't suffer the cost of the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=452.64s)]
*  extra exertion to cut the wind. The Pentagon cuts the wind for companies, for multinational [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=459.04s)]
*  corporations. The State Department cuts the wind for multinational corporations and private equity [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=465.68s)]
*  funds and the whole financial overclass. The CIA cuts the wind for corporations and financial firms. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=470.96s)]
*  The USAID cuts the wind. And so you have these figures like George Soros, for example, and Bill [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  Gates, who are now obviously very well renowned in the NGO world, the Open Society Foundation, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=488.24s)]
*  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and then also Rockefeller, Carnegie Foundation, Ford Foundation, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=495.6s)]
*  all of these. All of these have corporations and financial firms attached to their philanthropy. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=502.72s)]
*  So they will receive funding from the US government, from USAID, or their portfolio assets will, or their [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=510.72s)]
*  portfolio NGOs or companies will, but they will also donate into it. And I bring this up because [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=518.88s)]
*  oftentimes they are paid by the government, but oftentimes they're actually paying into a [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=527.04s)]
*  government project that advances some other interest. And I can go through a bunch of examples [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=531.92s)]
*  of this, but maybe I'll come back to the history real quick. So in 1948, this was the start of the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=536.48s)]
*  intelligence state in America. It was NSC 10-2 authored by George Kennan, which gave the CIA its [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=545.92s)]
*  plausible deniability doctrine that allowed the CIA to have a license to lie. The CIA came into [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=553.28s)]
*  creation. I'm going to just take a quick slide here. The CIA was created because the State Department [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=562.56s)]
*  wanted dirty deeds done without being attributed to the State Department. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=573.12s)]
*  So they needed some outside agency which could do what George Kennan called two months before [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=577.2s)]
*  he authored the plausible deniability doctrine in NSC 10-2. He called this the inauguration of [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=584.48s)]
*  organized political warfare. This is a very little known memo that was not declassified, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=590.96s)]
*  I believe until 2005. It was written in 1948. Everyone knows George Kennan as the head of the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=596.24s)]
*  policy planning staff at the State Department as the author of the containment strategy, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=603.52s)]
*  Russia and the Cold War, one of the most celebrated folks in US diplomacy history. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=609.28s)]
*  But two months before granting this license to do all this, to have the CIA operate through NGOs, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=614.96s)]
*  through civil society organizations, through private foundations, through these astroturf [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=622.16s)]
*  grass roots, advocacy, nonprofits. He wrote this memo called the inauguration of organized [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=628.88s)]
*  political warfare. He argues that this is now April 1948. We had just effectively rigged the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=637.36s)]
*  1948 Italian election, April 18, 1948. This was the first democratic election in Italy, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=645.84s)]
*  which after World War II had ended. It pitted basically a pro-US, pro-Western [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=655.52s)]
*  democracy candidate versus a pro-Soviet autocracy candidate was how it was pitched. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=665.44s)]
*  And the very first national security memo, 1-1, was on the central importance of Italy to the US [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=671.52s)]
*  position at the dawn of the Cold War and that we could not afford to lose this election. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=680.72s)]
*  And so the very first covert action of the Central Intelligence Agency, because [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=686.4s)]
*  under the 1947 act, it was largely conceived of as being an intelligence collection agency, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=692.24s)]
*  not so much operations. The CIA has two different career tracks. Intelligence, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=697.68s)]
*  they call it the analyst track and the operations track. And they're very different breeds of people. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=703.68s)]
*  They're very, very different in what they do. One of them, you collect the intelligence and [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=708.88s)]
*  you synthesize it for policymakers at the State Department or at the White House National Security [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=712.8s)]
*  Council. A lot of reading, a lot of foreign websites. Yes, a lot of academics. And the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  operations is where you get the Berry Seal, cocaine cowboy types, and the kind of wild folks [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=722.88s)]

*  authorization to do what it did, it was a last-minute, last-ditch, hail Mary effort to [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=905.44s)]
*  swing the election, and they took the assets that they had had from World War II, backing, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=910.48s)]
*  at that time, the OSS, the War Department, before in 1948 it changed to the Defense Department, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=918.32s)]
*  the War Department had worked closely with the Vatican, with the Church, as well as with [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=925.2s)]
*  mafia organizations, organized crime organizations, organized crime factions in Italy that were being [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=931.04s)]
*  prosecuted by Mussolini, and we were teamed up with them. They gave us access to ports, to [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=937.04s)]
*  infrastructure, to safe houses. They were a big network, pro-US network node during World War II, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=944.16s)]
*  and because of their influence on unions, they allowed us to run arms, run transshipments of [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=952.72s)]
*  supplies, food, assistance, all of that, which is one of the reasons that the Italian mafia was [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=960.32s)]
*  protected for 60 years, was very much a Cold War asset for the US. So the CIA achieves the successful [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=966.48s)]
*  result in April 1948, and they do so by using NGOs. They use charity fronts. They use philanthropic [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=976.8s)]
*  foundations to funnel money and assistance in. They work through the unions and the trade labor [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=985.12s)]
*  associations, which are civil society organizations that you can consider in the NGO fold. They work [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=992.24s)]
*  through all of these charities, foundations, nonprofits, the NGO sphere, in order to run [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=999.12s)]
*  this election rigging in 1948. So 12 days later, George Kennan writes a memo from the US State [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1007.28s)]
*  Department called the Inauguration of Organized Political Warfare, and everyone can look this up [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1014.0s)]
*  online, and he lays out how this is the model blueprint for the American power in the 20th [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1018.48s)]
*  century, and that we need to overcome the basic distinction between peace and war that Americans [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1025.36s)]
*  have long believed there was, because the average American does not understand the intricacies of [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1031.04s)]
*  international relations, and if we don't seize this initiative to build an organized political [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1036.24s)]
*  warfare apparatus through this State Department intelligence function, then we will lose the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1043.92s)]
*  American century, we'll lose the 20th century to the Bolsheviks or to the British, who each have [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1051.1200000000001s)]
*  their own Department of Dirty Tricks. And so it goes on to say that this is a State Department [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1058.8000000000002s)]
*  function. Ideally, it would be within a State Department Bureau of Political Warfare, so I think [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1064.0s)]
*  the Director of Political Warfare is what they wanted to call this until they decided, and in the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1072.0s)]
*  memo he says that there are problems with this, which is that because the State Department provides [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1076.72s)]
*  a public audit of its funds, we would not be able to conceal these funds in the State Department [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1081.68s)]
*  budget. So it might be ideal to have an outside intelligence agency to take on this function, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1087.52s)]
*  and that's why two months later the CIA was given the plausible deniability doctrine, and given [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1094.16s)]
*  delegated these powers by that very author, George Kennan. But at the back of this memo [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1100.88s)]
*  are fascinating exhibits of contemplated ways to structure recommendations and proposals for [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1105.92s)]
*  structuring this CIA intelligence work through NGOs, and it includes creating, for example, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1114.0s)]
*  voluntary councils of an outside organization that would nominally look to the public [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1123.3600000000001s)]
*  like it was a grassroots organization that is helmed by fine upstanding members of the American [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1130.08s)]
*  establishment or people in great repute. He actually uses the line, members of the American [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1139.1999999999998s)]
*  business community of the caliber of Alan Dulles. Of course, Alan Dulles was the CIA Chief, but they [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1146.24s)]
*  would- A true criminal. Right, and in the time his brother was running the State Department, but [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1151.6s)]
*  it goes on to say that it would look to the world like it's an NGO, but it would receive funding from [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1159.6799999999998s)]
*  the CIA, it would receive guidance from the CIA, and it would constantly coordinate. And [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1168.0s)]
*  it was at that very year that the term NGO really became a codified term when the term [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1175.6s)]
*  non-governmental organization was entered into the charter of the UN Declaration on Human Rights [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1183.6799999999998s)]
*  in 1948, where the Economic and Social Council was directed to coordinate everything it did with [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1191.28s)]
*  NGOs. And that's really the sort of etymology of that term in terms of its explosions when the UN [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1200.8s)]
*  codified that term. And that's what essentially set off this NGO arms race, this proliferation of [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1208.08s)]
*  cells within American statecraft, the American business community, within the American intelligence [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1217.04s)]
*  community, the national security community, to each create their own cellular circuitry in order [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1222.9599999999998s)]
*  to advance their interests. And I can get sort of deeper into that story. If you'd like, I can just [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1229.04s)]
*  take it from history there to present. But I'd feel remiss if I didn't also note that [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1235.68s)]
*  there's a government and there's a business side of it. And the thing that I think a lot of people [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1242.72s)]
*  are missing in this story and the attempt to take on the rogue elements of the NGOplex is that [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1247.44s)]
*  last time we talked, it was right after USAID had announced its closure. And I took what a lot of [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1255.6000000000001s)]
*  people I think thought was a somber tone on that, that I was celebrating its shutdown, but I was [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1264.0s)]
*  braced for impact about the ramifications of this and how it might play out. And I think I used the [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1271.6s)]
*  term that this is necessary to do this open heart surgery. We also have to ensure that the patient [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1281.04s)]
*  doesn't die on the operating table. Just because it's the right diagnosis doesn't mean you can set [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1286.64s)]
*  it and forget it. If you don't midwife the process diligently, you could kill the entire American [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1292.96s)]
*  empire. And I bring up that point here because it's not just American intelligence and American [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1298.08s)]
*  statecraft and the State Department, the DOD, the CIA. It's also virtually every single major [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1306.48s)]
*  international corporation that we consider to be American that is wrapped up in this NGO [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1316.16s)]
* plex. And I can go through examples of how that manifests, but I can't think of a single industry [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1322.8s)]
*  that's domiciled in America that people think of as great American companies that is not deeply [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1335.92s)]
*  connected to the NGOplex and in some respects dependent on the NGOplex to secure their markets, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1343.2s)]
*  to secure their profitability, to secure their revenues, to secure their interests. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1351.28s)]
*  And while we are taking on the NGOplex, there's also this, and now they're going to make their [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1359.44s)]
*  voices heard through lobbying, through pressuring Congress. And this is what we're seeing. Congress [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1367.8400000000001s)]
*  is now looking like they're not going to codify these Doge cuts. We saw 26, I think, Republican [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1373.3600000000001s)]
*  members of Congress who are saying they're not going to approve the Doge cuts around USAID. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1378.32s)]
*  But a lot of this is, I think, to find the solution that is politically possible, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1384.56s)]
*  you have to understand, I guess, how the whole ecosystem works in order to provide, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1392.56s)]
*  offer solutions that might have political viability, if that makes sense. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1399.36s)]
*  Of course, of course it does. So, non-governmental is actually a sort of misleading description [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1403.6s)]
*  because they're para-governmental, it sounds like. They're not, I mean, we're led to believe they're [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1411.04s)]
*  doctors without borders or whatever, which I'm not against for the record, but whatever the famous NGO [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1417.28s)]
*  is, going into South Sudan to save people, they're acting totally independent. They're [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1422.6399999999999s)]
*  non-governmental, but that, as you just described so capably, that's a lie. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1428.32s)]
*  Well, this sort of gets down to the stem cell concept and what type of [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1435.84s)]
*  NGO cell type you're talking about. I'll give you a couple of examples. So, there are these [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1440.08s)]
*  para-governmental ones, like take, for example, the Open Society Foundation. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1446.32s)]
*  Started in 1979, according to George Soros, it was to provide basically a tax loophole for his kids. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1450.88s)]
*  That was the idea that he said. And then it quickly became wrapped up with the US State Department [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1457.76s)]
*  operating in all of the major Cold War hubs, especially in Eastern Europe, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1464.16s)]
*  and fomenting the turnover of those governments so that they would break away from the Soviet [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1469.76s)]
*  Union and join the US and Hungary, Romania, Poland, the whole litany. And meanwhile, he was running [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1475.6s)]
*  the Quantum Fund and his George Soros Management Fund that was speculating on the foreign currencies [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  of all these governments. So, while he's working with the State Department and the Central [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1494.0s)]
*  Intelligence Agency and every US embassy in every country in Eastern Europe, and using this [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1498.24s)]
*  foundation, this network to influence the course of those events so that their governments would [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1504.1599999999999s)]
*  flip, he's using his hedge fund to speculate way before anyone knows that this movement is even [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1510.96s)]
*  being cultivated by the State Department and by his own non-profits. He's speculating on the [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1520.4s)]
*  direction of those currencies. So, he's got insider trading knowledge of everything that's [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1526.64s)]
*  going to happen in these countries while he's betting on it. Sort of like the Nancy Pelosi [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1532.32s)]
*  stock tracker type of thing. But by the 1990s, the Open Society Foundation had become such a [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1536.48s)]
*  powerful force in Washington that Bill Clinton's Deputy Secretary of State, I think it was Strobe [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1544.64s)]
*  Talbot, who said, we think of the Open Society Foundation as being an independent but allied [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1552.0800000000002s)]
*  partner country like the UK or France or Germany. And so, we work closely with the Open Society [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1562.16s)]
*  Foundation. We consider them an ally, but we have to synchronize US foreign policy with the foreign [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1569.68s)]
*  policy set out by the Open Society Foundation. This is a quote, everyone can look this up, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1578.3200000000002s)]
*  it's on my timeline on X. But so, this is in the 1990s, this is 30 years ago at this point, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1583.44s)]
*  US foreign policy is being synchronized with the George Soros policy recommendations. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1591.04s)]
*  And a lot of this is because it's not just that George Soros is the largest donor to the Democrat [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1597.84s)]
*  Party. And Bill Clinton was obviously the Democrat President. George Soros provided two and a half [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1603.52s)]
*  times more than any other single individual to the Democrats in the last election cycle. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1609.04s)]
*  But it's that- In this, just this last election cycle? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1614.96s)]
*  Yeah, for Joe Biden, $100 million, I think the second largest was 40. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1618.16s)]
*  That's crazy. Yeah. And although that may be the 2020 election actually that I'm referring to with [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1622.56s)]
*  those numbers, because I think those were the numbers in 2024 pre-election. So, that may have [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1630.16s)]
*  been the 2020 election cycle, but I'm sure it's comparable for 2024. But so, the other part of it [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1634.24s)]
*  though is that the Soros Foundation, so it drafts off of those policies. And I can give you some [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1641.84s)]
*  crazy examples of this. In Mongolia is a particularly perfect example of this. But [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1648.9599999999998s)]
*  we'll come back to that in a second. So, it's not just that Soros donates to the political candidates, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1658.6399999999999s)]
*  who's running for president, who's running for attorney general, or who's running for district [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1666.08s)]
*  attorney. It's that the Soros Foundation is also a co-investor and a co-sponsor in government [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1670.88s)]
*  initiatives and government projects. At USAID, you will frequently find, almost constantly find, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1677.6000000000001s)]
*  that the Open Society Foundation is a donor into USAID initiatives, a donor into state [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1685.0400000000002s)]
*  department initiatives. And this is what you frequently see when a government agency cannot [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1693.1200000000001s)]
*  get sufficient funds allocated from Congress. They need to reach into the NGO sphere or into [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1700.4s)]
*  the private sector with multinational companies to effectively co-sponsor and provide the top-up [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1708.88s)]
*  capital to get the amount of money they need to run this operation. That's legal? Not only is it. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1714.64s)]
*  Can I just fund a war if I want? Can I just like send a check to the Pentagon to buy more? I mean, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1721.68s)]
*  we can have privately funded government. Yeah, we've had it since the banana wars. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1726.8s)]
*  We've had this relationship for… In Honduras. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1733.68s)]
*  Yeah, Honduras, Guatemala. This has been a constant feature of American statecraft [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1736.6399999999999s)]
*  almost since the beginning, which is that you have a government national security interest [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1745.6s)]
*  or a government commercial national interest, but then you also have the profiteers of those, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1752.1599999999999s)]
*  of that government action in the private sector, in the for-profit space, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1759.6s)]
*  and also at the NGO layer to the extent that they're getting funded to do this work or it [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1764.1599999999999s)]
*  satisfies the wants of the sponsors of the NGOs. So, I mean, this is what War is a Racket was about. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1769.04s)]
*  The Smedley Butler 1936 book about how all of the major multinational corporations were on the take [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1776.48s)]
*  for World War I. All of them were on the take for… When he's talking about how he toppled [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1784.3999999999999s)]
*  governments in South America for… What was it? The City National Bank and the petroleum companies. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1790.32s)]
*  United Fruit. United Fruit. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1799.36s)]
*  And, you know… But may I ask… I mean, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1801.28s)]
*  yes, I mean, of course I knew that. I read it, but I didn't understand that they are not only the [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1805.12s)]
*  beneficiaries of these policies, but also the funders of the policies. Yes. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1809.52s)]
*  The problem with that conceptually is that it puts… It's all beyond democratic control. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1814.72s)]
*  There's no way to vote out, you know, whoever, George Soros or Larry Fink or whatever. There's [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1823.04s)]
*  just kind of… Right? Right. Well, it's a tectonic plate. It's something that shapes the fabric of [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1829.92s)]
*  what we consider democracy to be. And I think arming everyone in America with the knowledge of [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1836.96s)]
*  that topography can shape the kinds of democratic action that you propose. Give me an example. I [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1847.8400000000001s)]
*  mean, this was just yesterday. The nation of El Salvador announced a 30% tax on all foreign funding [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1854.96s)]
*  of domestic NGOs within El Salvador. This is a shot heard around the world. There have been many [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1865.68s)]
*  attempts by countries to contain the NGO plex. Yeah. Most famously in Hungary. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1870.96s)]
*  Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia. Every time they've been confronted with street protests and attempts to [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1875.1200000000001s)]
*  pressure the parliament using civil disobedience and these same sort of state department USAID, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1884.96s)]
*  Soros Foundation type rent-a-riots. We saw that in Slovakia, Serbia. In Hungary, when they passed [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1892.0s)]
*  their NGO transparency bill, it was blocked by the EU. The EU intervened and said that you cannot [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1899.28s)]
*  enforce this NGO transparency law because… What? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1907.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes. Yes. And they threatened to cut them off of EU funding if they… [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1911.92s)]
*  Hungarians aren't allowed to know where the money's coming from into their own country? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1916.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. They called it the Russian law, by the way. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1920.0s)]
*  The Russia law? Yeah. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1923.44s)]
*  It's bad, therefore it's Russian. Well, the idea was Russia had banned USAID, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1926.48s)]
*  had banned the National Amendment for Democracy. I think in 2015 around then, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1931.28s)]
*  this was after the Pussy Riot incident. This is sort of a little bit pre-Navalny when the regime [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1936.1599999999999s)]
*  change was sort of from the right-wing national side. We attempted a sort of left-wing, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1943.76s)]
*  left-wing antifa type coup in Russia through the whole Pussy Riot and associated… [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1949.04s)]
*  Well, that wasn't like an organic artistic expression, is that what you're saying? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1959.12s)]
*  You can look up online the lead singer's pictures with Tony Blinken and standing at the State [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1964.1599999999999s)]
*  Department podium and all the National Endowment for Democracy literature on it and the USAID. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1971.1999999999998s)]
*  Just look up USAID. That wasn't just like an especially empowering form of feminism? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1979.6799999999998s)]
*  It was tactical. It was tactical feminism. And it always is with these people. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1987.36s)]
*  That's right. Boy, you've heard a lot of complaining in the last couple of weeks [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1992.3999999999999s)]
*  since Donald Trump announced his new import tariffs on foreign-made things. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=1996.56s)]
*  A lot of people don't like it, but the companies who make American products in America with American [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2001.2s)]
*  materials, they're pretty happy. They're not affected by this. They've been doing the right [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2007.6799999999998s)]
*  thing since the beginning. They're not paying tariffs because again, they're making American [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2013.12s)]
*  products for Americans. Liberty Safe is a perfect example. Liberty Safe is not making [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2019.36s)]
*  its stuff in some foreign country. It's not made in China or Vietnam or India. It's made right here [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2027.9199999999998s)]
*  with American steel. They employ skilled American craftsmen who do an amazing job. That's why they [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2034.0s)]
*  make the best safes there are. They have the highest standard of quality and security, so you [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2039.52s)]
*  don't have to worry that when you lock up things that you really care about, they're going to get [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2043.52s)]
*  stolen. They're not. These are safes you can trust. I keep my father's shotguns in a Liberty [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2047.68s)]
*  Safe at my house. When you buy Liberty, you support American jobs. You protect what matters most. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2053.36s)]
*  Choose American steel, American craftsmanship, choose Liberty. Visit LibertySafe.com for more. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2058.96s)]
*  But what happened was, after all this stuff, Russia basically banned foreign NGOs or at least [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2067.84s)]
*  banned a huge subset and required all this transparency around it, and they banned USAID [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2076.8s)]
*  and NED. When Hungary and Slovakia and Serbia and all these Eastern European countries who were in [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2082.8s)]
*  the post-Soviet orbit tried to pass transparency laws so that they could get a sense of how much [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2091.2000000000003s)]
*  of their own civil society cellular body was actually foreign assets of a foreign government, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2100.0s)]
*  these were referred to as Russian laws, the Russian law, because Russia had done this. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2110.88s)]
*  But think about this. This is so insane. But think about that framing. You can check out these [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2116.0s)]
*  protests online. They're hilarious. It's people protesting in the streets so that they are not [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2125.6s)]
*  allowed to know foreign funding of their own societies. I demand, I am not allowed to know. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2131.12s)]
*  Put the blindfolders on me. I am not allowed to know whether the newspapers I read, whether the [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2139.92s)]
*  union I'm a part of, whether the Lawyers Association I'm a part of, whether the private company that [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2145.44s)]
*  pays my paycheck, whether the public health sector, my hospitals, whether that is funded by [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2152.4s)]
*  a foreign government and how much is funding. And the Russians are not complaining about that [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2158.56s)]
*  because the money is not coming largely from, if the money was largely coming from the Russians, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2165.12s)]
*  the EU and the US State Department would be demanding this. We have this in the United States. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2171.04s)]
*  It's called a FARA registration, the Foreign Agents Registration Act. We consider that to be a [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2175.92s)]
*  criminal violation where you can spend five years in jail if you don't file a FARA registration. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2181.84s)]
*  But if Hungary or Serbia or Slovakia tries to pass a Foreign Agent Registration Act law there, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2189.04s)]
*  we call that an attack on democracy. Why? Because it reveals, it takes the mask off of the angioplex [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2195.76s)]
*  and reflects and shows to the people what it really is. It is the long arm of US intelligence. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2203.28s)]
*  It is the long arm of US statecraft and is the long arm of that corporate financial donor drafter [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2211.12s)]
*  class with all of their own secular private interests. If I could just interject and say, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2217.04s)]
*  what I find so infuriating is that none of this helps the America that I live in or want to live [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2223.52s)]
*  in. I mean, a lot of the agenda is being pushed, not just like, we want to grow our bananas in your [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2229.68s)]
*  banana favorable climate or we want cheaper coffee or we want your oil fields. It's like pushing [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2235.7599999999998s)]
*  stuff that is just terrible, awful, like you're blowing up families, attacking Christianity. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2242.64s)]
*  It's like, why does it have to be that too? Why that agenda? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2248.16s)]
*  This is where it gets really complicated. The idea behind this positive synergy between the [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2251.68s)]
*  corporate sponsored NGOs and the government sponsored NGOs and them all working together [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2262.3199999999997s)]
*  as a common blob was that if we secure American business in a country, American contracts, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2268.88s)]
*  American rights to minerals or American rights to mines, we're boxing out the Russians and the [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2279.52s)]
*  Chinese. That's not a crazy goal. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2285.76s)]
*  It's not a crazy goal. That, however, gives a license to some of the dirtiest stuff and this [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2288.0800000000004s)]
*  total profiteering, especially because the multinational corporations have no foot, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2300.48s)]
*  we're still living in Milton Friedman land. This is something Milton Friedman was a huge influence [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2305.76s)]
*  on me as a kid. Huge, huge, huge. Yeah, me too. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2310.0s)]

*  conservatives with this concept of maximizing total shareholder value, which is now codified [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2324.4s)]
*  effectively into our corporate law that you have a statutory- [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2330.96s)]
*  It's the law. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2336.88s)]
*  It's the law. You have a statutory, you have a duty to maximize total shareholder value. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2337.52s)]
*  That does not mean value for Americans. When your markets are abroad and your labor is abroad [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2342.72s)]
*  and your factories are abroad, but you are getting billions of dollars from the US government [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2350.16s)]
*  to advance your own private interests and you are toppling many solid parts of the world order to [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2357.7599999999998s)]
*  do so, you're overthrowing governments, you're bribing media, you're controlling organized crime [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2366.08s)]
*  groups and conflict zones and all the narco trafficking, all the dirty work that goes into [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2372.24s)]
*  making the sausage in a lot of these countries. It's not trickling down per Ronald Reagan [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2380.7999999999997s)]
*  to the people that live there. These companies all got extremely rich while the heartland turned [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2389.04s)]
*  into the rust belt. To me, it's no surprise when you see that John Bolton on Piers Morgan held up [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2395.52s)]
*  his USAID hand grenade when he was the head of USAID policy and budget on Ronald Reagan. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2404.48s)]
*  He showed this a few months ago on Piers Morgan, that is parting gift from USAID after he left [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2410.16s)]
*  running the policy and budget there. John Bolton, humanitarian assistance guy, was a USAID hand [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2416.24s)]

*  engraved in it. What did that imply? That he was trying to blow up USAID or that they're in fact [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2428.72s)]
*  using force? I think the idea was that they are hard charging about it. What it represents to me [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2437.52s)]
*  is this development defense, they call it the three Ds, the diplomacy defense development, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2446.08s)]
*  the idea that USAID is absolutely critical to US military operations. It's absolutely critical [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2454.56s)]
*  to US diplomatic operations. It's absolutely critical to US intelligence operations, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2460.72s)]
*  which supports the diplomacy and defense. While you're masquerading as this humanitarian [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2465.2799999999997s)]
*  NGO sponsor, you're the embodiment of the hand grenade. That's a Reaganite philosophy [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2472.4s)]
*  that we're fighting the ghost of. This idea that you deserve a slot within this [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2481.2000000000003s)]
*  government apparatus, US government apparatus, when you are not representing the interests of [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2489.76s)]
*  the United States. There are no conditions on it. There's no bounds on it other than you need to [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2494.32s)]
*  be in the good graces of that government. For example, the US embassy in Brasilia did nothing [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2501.84s)]
*  to stop Brazil's attack on X or Brazil's seizure of assets. Exactly. That's exactly right. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2508.4s)]
*  But this goes back a really long time. Gonzalo O'Leary as a US citizen was murdered by the [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2514.96s)]
*  Ukrainian government and nobody said a word about it. The US ambassador to Ukraine didn't say a word. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2520.16s)]
*  None of the million NGOs populated by Americans in Ukraine said a word. I don't see how they're on [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2525.2s)]
*  the side of America at all. Right. Well, the Soros example is really interesting. Can I share [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2533.52s)]
*  a few anecdotes? Gosh, I hope you will. When I went into the WikiLeaks archive to look at all the [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2540.16s)]
*  State Department cables that referenced George Soros or the Open Society Foundation or any of [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2547.6s)]
*  its associated groups, the Open Society Institution, the Open Society Forum, I was surprised when I saw [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2553.44s)]
*  the communications in the State Department cables start in 1973 because the Open Society Foundation [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2561.36s)]
*  did not start until 1979. When I looked at the State Department cables, they were all [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2568.96s)]
*  related to Soros Associates, which was the firm operated by George Soros' older brother, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2577.2000000000003s)]
*  Paul Soros, who is, according to his New York Times obituary, one of the greatest titans of the [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2587.28s)]
*  shipping and port and infrastructure development world. Paul Soros is all over these State [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2595.52s)]
*  Department cables in tons of countries. Gabon, Iran, remember this is pre-1970s. This is, you know. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2603.6s)]
*  Pre-revolution, yeah. Right. And so the State Department is working with [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2612.7999999999997s)]
*  Soros Associates, Paul Soros, in order to secure contracts for him, in order to secure [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2622.56s)]
*  favorable loan terms to foreign governments, and in order to intervene on the bidding process [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2630.24s)]
*  for port construction, for lucrative port deals. I think one in Gabon was, I think, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2637.3599999999997s)]
*  like a, I think it was like a 700 million to a billion dollar port project. You know, huge money for [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2642.8799999999997s)]
*  Gabon, a project in Gabon in early 1970s. And one of these cable, State Department cables is [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2650.56s)]
*  really interesting. It's the U.S. Embassy there, and they are talking about how three senior [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2658.24s)]
*  executives from Brown and Root are going to be coming to Gabon that week, and are looking to have [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2665.6s)]
*  arrangements made to meet with, I think, the president of the country and other influential [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2674.9599999999996s)]
*  leaders in government and in civil society, and for the embassy to arrange everything from [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2681.04s)]
*  their travel to their hotel to introducing them to all the senior leaders in the country. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2689.12s)]
*  And Brown and Root was working together with Soros and Associates on this port project, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2695.12s)]
*  and they were bidding against other foreign infrastructure development companies from other [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2703.6s)]
*  countries. And one of the cables basically suggests that the embassy should relay back to Soros and [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2711.92s)]
*  Brown and Root the status of the bid going to them, and anything favorable that can be done to nudge [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2722.56s)]
*  that contract going to Brown and Root and Soros. Now what's interesting about this is a few things. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2730.8799999999997s)]
*  So this is the example of what you were talking about, which is we're doing this because we want [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2737.3599999999997s)]
*  to stop, you know, there's a big fight over Africa with the Russians and with the Chinese all [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2743.52s)]
*  throughout the Cold War. You know, a lot of Africa sided with Russia, and the Russian communism was [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2748.08s)]
*  seen as an egalitarian counterweight to a sort of racist United States, and there was a big [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2755.12s)]
*  diplomacy push there. So getting Brown and Root and Soros to control the infrastructure in the [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2760.3999999999996s)]
*  country and to get those contracts and to get the proceeds and remits was advancing U.S. interests [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2768.3199999999997s)]
*  under U.S. national security and U.S. national interests, which means there's a State Department [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2774.7999999999997s)]
*  interest in doing favors for Soros and Brown and Root. Now Brown and Root, which would later become [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2779.8399999999997s)]
*  Halliburton, or Brown and Root is, I guess, Halliburton, I guess, acquired Brown and Root. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2788.24s)]
*  Kellogg Brown and Root. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2795.44s)]
*  Yes, right, which of course is, you know, Dick Cheney was the CEO and president, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2796.24s)]
*  and Brown and Root in the JFK files, it was very interesting. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2802.64s)]
*  The ones that were declassified just a few months ago by Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2808.7999999999997s)]
*  they have a whole section on the CIA's, all the CIA influence nodes over Brown and Root, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2815.84s)]
*  and it was fascinating. I believe both Brown, senior and junior, held covert security clearances [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2822.2400000000002s)]
*  with the Central Intelligence Agency. There's a memo in these new unredacted JFK files, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2831.04s)]
*  and it was a CIA internal fact check, a crisis communications, how do we respond [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2837.52s)]
*  to this new piece in Ramparts magazine called Brown and Root CIA Dimensions? And, you know, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2844.64s)]
*  so this is the Houston Republican CIA power base. This has been the big power base of the [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2852.96s)]
*  Republican party for almost 100 years now, this oil, giant oil zone. Yes, exactly. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2860.0s)]
*  So no matter how you feel about Donald Trump, it's hard to deny that his second term has been [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2868.32s)]
*  a whirlwind. It's amazing how fast this administration is advancing its agenda, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2872.4s)]
*  putting illegal aliens, slashing government waste, an entirely new trade strategy. No one has ever [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2877.92s)]
*  seen anything like it. They are not messing around. Now, many people are thrilled by this fast start, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2883.28s)]
*  but it's going to take a lot more than this to achieve the ultimate goal, and that's why our [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2888.0s)]
*  friends at the Heritage Foundation are mobilizing supporters, patriots across the country to support [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2891.6s)]
*  this administration and the broader conservative movement, and they need your help to do that. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2896.8s)]
*  You can go to heritage.org slash survey to complete their national survey on Donald Trump's [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2900.7999999999997s)]
*  second term agenda. What you tell them will help their team work with the White House to make the [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2906.7999999999997s)]
*  president's campaign promises a reality. I used to work at Heritage 35 years ago, gave me my first [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2912.3199999999997s)]
*  job. I've always been grateful for that. Heritage is not like every other think tank in DC, almost [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2919.92s)]
*  all of which are part of the problem. Heritage is fighting the problem. I can say that. Go to [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2925.44s)]
*  heritage.org slash survey to help them fill out the survey, heritage.org slash survey. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2930.64s)]
*  Ramparts writes this piece, and it accuses the CIA of running this vast network through the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2938.08s)]
*  petroleum industry and through a web of NGOs and trade associations all over Houston, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2945.36s)]
*  and it focuses on this Brown and Root network because Brown and Root also had something called [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2953.7599999999998s)]
*  the Brown Foundation, which was a corporate-sponsored NGO, and in this, they actually [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2958.4s)]
*  reveal that both Brown Sr. and Brown Jr. had covert security clearances for work with the [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2968.64s)]
*  Central Intelligence Agency. So while you have one of the world's premier infrastructure and [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2975.92s)]
*  development firms, which would later be going to work with Soros in Africa and then would later [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2982.64s)]
*  spawn Vice President Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, who started off her career in USAID and comes from [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2991.12s)]
*  that same Halliburton, Brown and Root lineage. They direct ties all over the CIA, and I guess [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=2998.0s)]
*  I bring this up to say that in addition to that, you had this web of adjacent NGOs around [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3008.48s)]
*  statecraft there. So for example, in that same files, again, the CIA is doing an internal fact [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3014.72s)]
*  check in this memo where they say Ramparts has accused all of these people of being CIA, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3019.68s)]
*  and it's a memo, I think, to one of the local directors saying, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3025.44s)]
*  we've reviewed the files. Here's what's true and false about the Ramparts article, and in one of [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3030.88s)]
*  these, they describe something called the Vernon Fund, which was a private philanthropy. Well, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3036.88s)]
*  it was created by the Central Intelligence Agency to look to the public like a private foundation, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3043.04s)]
*  and it was set up to fund the webs of teachers unions all throughout the world. They sponsor [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3049.76s)]
*  something called the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3058.96s)]
*  The CIA was running an initiative at the time to control the education space during the Cold War [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3063.7599999999998s)]
*  to stop the spread of communist teaching or communist sympathizing teachings and curricula, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3071.7599999999998s)]
*  especially in Cold War conflict zones all over Europe, all over Africa, all over Latin America. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3080.0s)]
*  And so, to do that, to control, to make sure that students and young people and every person in [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3086.16s)]
*  society who comes up through the education system is ideologically aligned against communism, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3095.44s)]
*  they had to control the teachers unions and what was being taught, what was being promoted, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3100.0s)]
*  and I bring this up, again, I hate communism, but all this was repurposed against right-wing [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3105.8399999999997s)]
*  populism when Trump won in 2016. Because instead of this same blob being threatened from its [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3111.68s)]
*  communist socialist left, it was being threatened from its populist nationalist right. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3117.6s)]
*  In this memo, the CIA says, yeah, they're right about the Vernon Fund. Ramparts is right. That [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3123.52s)]
*  was ours. We set it up to look like a private philanthropy. We recruited the daughter of the [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3128.56s)]
*  Texas governor to bundle money to the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3135.84s)]
*  Profession in order to influence the National Education Association and create, I think it was [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3141.52s)]
*  like 140 different trade associations that they all worked through. Now, the National Education [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3147.6000000000004s)]
*  Association is the largest of the teaching union associations and the World Confederation of [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3151.44s)]
*  Organizations of the Teaching Profession is still around today. It's called Education [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3159.44s)]
*  International. They rebranded the name, but it's the same organization. And by the way, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3163.04s)]
*  in these CIA files, they explicitly say the president of the World Confederation of [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3167.7599999999998s)]
*  Organizations of the Teaching Profession has a CIA covert clearance to do this work, the treasurer, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3172.8s)]
*  the executive secretary. So the thing is funded by the CIA, by a NGO that was actually created by [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3180.48s)]
*  the CIA, the senior leadership of the trade association doing the work, our CIA at every [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3188.88s)]
*  part of the layer. But how many people in Education International, how many teachers in that union, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3196.2400000000002s)]
*  you think, know that story? How many fifth grade teachers, how many administrators at the union [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3202.1600000000003s)]
*  level, how many people in the schools know that? So when you see Education International today [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3207.76s)]
*  come out in Germany, because it branches in every country, in Germany, Education International has [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3212.7200000000003s)]
*  come out and said, AFD, no one affiliated with AFD should be allowed to be a teacher in Germany. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3217.84s)]
*  And they petitioned the German government to not allow AFD at any of the- [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3224.32s)]
*  You can't have a job if you vote for the party. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3229.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. But this is exactly what our CIA has been calling for, because AFD has been trying to revive [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3231.04s)]
*  the Nord Stream pipeline and trying to restore relations with Russia. So from the national [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3236.88s)]
*  security side of this, there's a predicate to say, yeah, we're authorized to run this operation. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3241.68s)]
*  But what do you do there? Now you've got the AFD, which is the most popular party in Germany, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3248.56s)]
*  right now in polling, it's got, I think, 26%. They doubled their votes in the recent election, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3254.64s)]
*  but since then, polling shows that they are now the most popular party in Germany. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3263.44s)]
*  They were declared an extremist organization by their own national security state, which is [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3267.76s)]
*  effectively our national security state. We gave birth to Germany as a unified country in the 1990s [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3273.84s)]
*  and midwifed its entire intelligence apparatus. The center of US intelligence in the Cold War [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3280.88s)]
*  was in Germany. And so you have this blob interest in banning AFD, the German government, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3286.8s)]
*  declares the most popular party in the country, an extremist group. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3298.0s)]
*  If the definition of extreme is that it is a departure from what's popular. And so by its very [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3303.9199999999996s)]
*  definition, it's a contradiction is what I'm getting at there. But that, and thank God for [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3311.2799999999997s)]
*  Marco Rubio and Senator Tom Cotton, to his credit, was fantastic on this. He did a great job [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3319.8399999999997s)]
*  directing, he and Tulsi Gabbard, I think directed Tulsi Gabbard at ODNI to threaten to not, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3327.68s)]
*  to discontinue intelligence sharing with German intelligence for this domestic surveillance, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3335.2s)]
*  because this extremist label allowed the German government to spy on every member of the AFD as [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3341.68s)]
*  if they were al- al-Qaeda. And so because of US diplomatic pressure from our state department, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3347.52s)]
*  our ODNI, our Congress, Germany has temporarily put that in the enforcement of their surveillance [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3355.84s)]
*  dimension on pause. But what I'm getting at is this is this is a CIA proprietary, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3363.2000000000003s)]
*  Education International, who's doing active work to do exactly what the Bill Burns CIA, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3369.1200000000003s)]
*  the John Brennan CIA wants done in Germany. And of course, who was the US ambassador to Germany [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3376.1600000000003s)]
*  while this all played out with the Nord Stream pipeline blowing up? It was Amy Gutman, my dean [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3382.88s)]
*  at the University of Pennsylvania. You know, Amy Gutman, when I was there 20 years ago, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3388.2400000000002s)]
*  she was the dean then, then she became the US ambassador to Germany. I had the state department [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3395.36s)]
*  in Germany during the Biden administration. And meanwhile, what's the University of Pennsylvania [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3400.08s)]
*  doing? It's housing the Penn Biden Center, which is this major foreign policy coordinating node [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3406.0s)]
*  at the university layer. Again, universities are just super NGOs. The universities will [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3412.48s)]
*  organize the international exchanges of ideas with civil society in all these foreign countries. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3419.2s)]
*  They will produce the white papers that get picked up by the media. They will liaise with, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3425.28s)]
*  meet with government officials to advise on economic policy, don't you know, in the region. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3431.2s)]
*  You know, this is the whole Jeffrey Sachs Harvard Institute of International Development. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3435.92s)]
*  And it's all tax free. That's the part that I mean, I because you began this history of the [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3440.7999999999997s)]
*  NGO and thank you for doing it. With reference to the tax code, the introduction of the income tax [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3446.48s)]
*  in 1913 and then the tax exempt statutes of 1917, right in the middle of First World War, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3452.0s)]
*  not surprisingly. But like, isn't the whole idea of it, my understanding of a 501 c three, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3458.0s)]
*  well, I know, because I ran one. The idea is that this helps America. We're encouraging charity. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3464.72s)]
*  But you're describing nonprofits that are arms of the Intel community or, you know, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3471.6s)]
*  working to increase profit to American businesses that may not actually really be American and [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3478.3199999999997s)]
*  publicly traded companies, not American. It's owned by the sovereign wealth funds of nine [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3482.56s)]
*  different countries. You know, it's like, the whole thing is fake. So what in 2025 is the [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3486.16s)]
*  justification for continuing to subsidize these? Because I mean, a tax exemption is a subsidy. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3491.2s)]
*  In fact, someone's got to run the government. Someone's got to fund the patent office. If [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3498.24s)]
*  it's not you, it's going to be me. So but why should we subsidize these things? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3501.3599999999997s)]
*  They have three reasons. National security, national interest, and securing export markets. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3507.04s)]
*  And, and, you know, the idea is, is what does America look like if we don't do this? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3515.12s)]
*  We're in a competition right now with Huawei in the, in the telecom space, in the IT infrastructure [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3521.2799999999997s)]
*  space, major State Department initiatives to try to get neutral third party governments to [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3528.7999999999997s)]
*  do away with Huawei and sign up with AT&T, or if not that other kind of 5g light providers like, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3538.32s)]
*  like LG and Nokia in Finland and South Korea to so that at least it's not China, Huawei. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3549.12s)]
*  And there's lots of reasons given for this. But the idea is, is if you can, if you can get [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3557.2s)]
*  AT&T to get those contracts, well, AT&T is an American company, and this will help American [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3562.4s)]
*  GDP, and this will help American jobs. And, and so like a great example, this is what just happened [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3567.68s)]
*  in Syria. So there's been this big fight over this, this group, the well, also made Syria has, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3572.8s)]
*  we just lifted sanctions on Syria. Yes, last month, yes, Muhammad Al Jelani, the [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3583.6000000000004s)]
*  ISIS commander turned Al Qaeda commander turned Idlib, you know, rebel moderate rebel leader, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3588.8s)]
*  who became, you know, they have de facto head of state in Syria. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3599.3599999999997s)]
*  Now meeting with the US president. Yes, meeting with the US president, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3605.12s)]
*  meeting with every major world leader. The US just declared that we're lifting sanctions on, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3608.72s)]
*  on Syria, after Syria pledged to open up its market to basically use US and Western [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3617.44s)]
*  companies and contractors for its services, rather than Russian or Chinese ones. So for example, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3624.64s)]
*  one of the pledges was to use AT&T for its wireless and telecom services rather than Huawei. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3631.2799999999997s)]
*  Where are they going to buy their pagers? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3638.08s)]
*  It's all it's, and yeah, it goes without saying that when, you know, the State Department [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3643.6s)]
*  lobbies to allow AT&T to do your, your wireless infrastructure that, you know, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3649.52s)]
*  that we're monitoring it, of course. Right. But you can see how, like, what would America [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3656.56s)]
*  look like if AT&T's, now there's, I think, what, 25 million people or so in, in Syria. So AT&T has [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3662.16s)]
*  just secured 25 million customers effectively, at the, at the, you know, barrel of a gun effectively [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3669.3599999999997s)]
*  with the, they've drafted off of the US Defense Department who funded the paramilitaries in Syria. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3677.44s)]
*  They've drafted off of USAID and the billions we funneled into Syria. They've drafted off of [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3687.04s)]
*  State Department diplomacy on their behalf. And, you know, a great example of this is- [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3691.92s)]
*  Let me just say, I mean, I, well, I definitely don't think that the ISIS guy is in any real sense [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3698.88s)]
*  is in any real sense better than Bashar al-Assad, you know, the ophthalmologist. That's just my [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3705.2s)]
*  opinion. I don't think that we should be friends with the ISIS guy or the al-Qaeda guy after they [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3710.8799999999997s)]
*  murdered 3000 Americans. Like, I don't understand that, or I do understand it, but it has nothing [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3717.04s)]
*  to do with the United States. So that bothers me. On the other hand, since we are doing that, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3720.56s)]
*  I think it's great that AT&T is getting the contract. I don't have a problem with that. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3725.8399999999997s)]
*  And what you're describing is a pretty conventional process where the US State Department, White House, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3729.04s)]
*  and DOD all kind of combine forces to help American business abroad. Great. In general, great. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3734.56s)]
*  I don't like the constellation, the mushy constellation of, quote, non-profits that [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3742.96s)]
*  operate in a very shadowy way. Like, why do we need them for this? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3749.52s)]
*  Well, let's stick with the Syria example for a second. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3755.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3758.4s)]
*  And go over one of the shadiest of the non-profits, which is the US Institute of Peace. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3759.2799999999997s)]
*  The US Institute of Peace. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3765.6s)]
*  By the way, if you fly into DC, into national airport, Reagan National Airport, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3767.9199999999996s)]
*  which is like the closest airport to any city in America, it's right there, right across the river, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3771.7599999999998s)]
*  and you come in from the north, you fly directly over the US Institute of Peace, and it's a kind of [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3776.24s)]
*  clamshell, it's a beautiful building, it's a modern building, which was probably the only [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3782.8799999999997s)]
*  pretty modern building in Washington, and you think to yourself, what the hell is that, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3787.68s)]
*  and where'd they get the money? What is that? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3791.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, international peace is a funny piece, and international peace is a funny history with US [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3794.0s)]
*  intelligence work. In the JFK files, for example, in the recent declassifications, it showed a group [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3800.56s)]
*  that the CIA infiltrated and directed called the Catholic Association of International Peace, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3806.08s)]
*  and there are all these files that show that, yes, we have our assets in here, and they're [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3813.52s)]
*  doing this for this. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, not the Catholic Association [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3818.16s)]
*  for International Peace, but a second international peace group, the Carnegie Endowment for International [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3824.08s)]
*  Peace, was run from 2014 to 2021 by Bill Burns, the guy who would leave the Carnegie Endowment [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3827.52s)]
*  for International Peace to run the Central Intelligence Agency. What qualifies you as running [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=3838.64s)]

*  the New York Times, was that it would be terrible for groups to be seen as subsidized by the Central [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4027.44s)]
*  Intelligence Agency. We saw that happen in the 1960s where it was revealed groups were funded [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4034.24s)]
*  by the CIA and it caused embarrassment. That's why the endowment was created. It's literally a [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4040.7999999999997s)]
*  direct quote saying that the endowment was created to fund the groups that it would be [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4047.04s)]
*  embarrassing for them to be publicly revealed that they got CIA funding. Of course, it was [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4051.2799999999997s)]
*  conceived in the office of Reagan's CIA. William Casey and Raymond Green, there's a whole CIA [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4057.04s)]
*  backstory to that, the whole Ned thing. But in 1984, another layer of gongo. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4065.2s)]
*  So, you know, so the US Institute of Peace was set up to be a National Endowment for Democracy, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4072.4s)]
*  but really focused on conflict zones. And those, whereas the National Endowment for Democracy [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4081.2000000000003s)]
*  operates everywhere. They'll operate in, you know, very heavily in Hungary or, you know, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4085.2000000000003s)]

*  operations, for example. So they, in those places, it's a different track of influence for the NGOs [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4103.76s)]
*  because they're working with these communities in these, they're working with the farmers where the [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4112.64s)]
*  coca leaves or cocaine are being grown. They're working, you know, they're working, you mentioned [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4119.36s)]
*  coffee. USAID has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the coffee trade sector. And USAID [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4124.16s)]
*  does all this joint work with Starbucks, all this joint work with Keurig. They operate in conflict [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4134.639999999999s)]
*  zones and the drug zones in Colombia, in Peru, the Central African Republic, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4139.92s)]
*  in the Republic, Sedan. And what they're doing here is, sorry, they're, well, I got distracted [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4144.88s)]
*  by the coffee thought, sorry. What the US Institute of Peace is doing is they're building giant [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4157.52s)]
*  networks and serving as a back channel diplomacy. They're doing field work. So they are, you know, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4162.56s)]
*  if you're in Foggy Bottom or Langley, Virginia, if you want to know what's happening on the ground [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4169.84s)]
*  in Syria, you need the people in the field to report it to you. You need either the US embassy [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4174.64s)]
*  or you need the NGOs connected to the embassy to provide the field work. We want to know what [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4182.160000000001s)]
*  is happening economically in this region, which is the economic, you know, bread basket that's [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4189.52s)]
*  supporting the US military operations or the mercenary troops so that we can keep them funded. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4195.12s)]
*  We want to keep the industry in Afghanistan going, the industry in Syria in these sections. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4200.72s)]
*  So the US Institute of Peace will do those surveys. They'll work with the local populations. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4206.4800000000005s)]
*  They'll build giant networks. And, you know, in June 2023, the US Institute of Peace, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4211.04s)]
*  after the Taliban took over Afghanistan, they wrote a piece called Why the Taliban's [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4219.12s)]
*  Successful Opium Ban is Bad for Afghanistan and Bad for the World. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4225.92s)]
*  And they openly called on the Taliban. We're not getting enough opium. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4231.04s)]
*  Yes. Mike, it's a problem. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4235.12s)]
*  Right. But the opium was funding the entire paramilitary network in Syria. You know, everyone [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4237.12s)]
*  says, oh, ISIS, traffics and drugs, Al Qaeda, traffics and drugs. Well, guess what? ISIS and [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4246.24s)]
*  Al Qaeda, with the with the full backing of the Biden government, just successfully overthrew [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4252.72s)]
*  the Biden administration's top enemy in the region and now have opened up all their markets to [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4260.56s)]
*  Chevron and AT&T. And what I'm saying is, is they were openly this same group that is working with [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4268.16s)]
*  these Taliban networks and these Afghan special forces and is deeply, deeply involved in Syria. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4277.04s)]
*  Is openly calling and this is not that they got busted paying these Taliban officials when Trump [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4282.8s)]
*  tried to assert control over the US Institute of Peace because it's chartered by Congress. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4290.240000000001s)]
*  It has 15 members of its board. Three of them are mandatory. The Secretary of State, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4295.52s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense and the President of the National Defense University are three reserve [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4302.08s)]
*  spots. So think about this is the US Institute of Peace, but required on the board is the [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4306.8s)]
*  Secretary of War, the head of the the War Institute and the Secretary of State. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4311.2s)]
*  And then there are 12 political appointee spots. Now, the Trump administration tried to assert [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4317.84s)]
*  control over the US Institute of Peace as it is statutorily entitled to do. And the response from [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4323.76s)]
*  the US Institute of Peace was to barricade the doors to delete, Doge said, a terabyte worth of [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4329.28s)]
*  financial data, which Doge says it recovered and showed payments to those very Taliban networks [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4335.36s)]
*  that they were saying keep the drugs flowing. And so evidently, according to the Doge team, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4341.599999999999s)]
*  they found weapons, caches inside like, like a full military, you know, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4349.599999999999s)]
*  they found weapons inside the Institute of Peace. That was what Doge reported. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4354.639999999999s)]
*  This they said back to Orwell now, right? The peace people are stockpiling weapons. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4358.4s)]
*  But recently, so this has gone through the courts because, you know, the whole blob resistance has [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4363.36s)]
*  been trying to stop all these shutdowns at every layer. The outside general counsel for the US [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4370.08s)]
*  Institute of Peace has he was been the the outside general counsel for since 1986, just two years. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4376.639999999999s)]
*  So he so the guy in who's the head lawyer there has been the head lawyer there. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4385.2s)]
*  Since just two years after was founded since the mid 1980s. So has been, you know, mid wiping the [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4392.16s)]
*  legal dark, dark arts of this thing, since almost the day it was born. And he's the one who I believe [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4400.5599999999995s)]
*  has spearheaded or been leading this this lawsuit to stop the the federal governments, because the [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4411.04s)]
*  Trump administration cleared the board. The US Institute of Peace would not even allow the Trump [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4418.88s)]
*  appointed board members or its president even go in the building. That's why the federal police [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4425.04s)]
*  had the FBI had to come in and in. But what happened was is that same lawyer also happens [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4430.320000000001s)]
*  to represent the Wireless Trade Association in the US and AT&T in that whole network. So while they [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4438.0s)]
*  are working for regime change in Syria, while the US Institute of Peace is taking US taxpayer money, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4447.04s)]
*  55 million a year to build up this network of paramilitary groups, and all these economic [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4452.24s)]
*  assistance programs and mid wiping the political negotiations of creating a unified, cohesive block [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4460.24s)]
*  against the the Assad government in Syria. With US US Institute of Peace funds, the same lawyer who's [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4468.64s)]
*  who's now successfully sued because Judge Barrel Howe blocked the Trump administration's attempt [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4476.64s)]
*  now, now we're back to square one with that. He simultaneously is representing the Wireless Trade [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4481.92s)]
*  Association, where Syria just, you know, turned over its IT infrastructure to AT&T. So I mean, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4486.8s)]
*  just think about that. You've got you've got the US Institute of Peace organizing this regime change [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4495.68s)]
*  in Syria, including using, you know, these narco traffic drugs while calling for the narco [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4501.28s)]
*  networks to keep going. And simultaneously, the, you know, the senior executives effectively, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4507.76s)]
*  I know he's senior, he's out top outside counsel, but the senior executives effectively are [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4516.0s)]
*  representing the companies that are the direct beneficiaries of this regime change action. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4520.16s)]
*  So it doesn't matter if it's good for US national security or US national interest to topple Bashar [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4524.0s)]
*  Assad, because they have a fundamentally unique and singular benefit, whether it's good for us [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4528.64s)]
*  or not, which is that they get rich from it. I remember reading about the fascists. And one of [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4534.0s)]
*  the one of the criticisms that I thought really resonated was they eliminated the difference [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4540.88s)]
*  between the state and you know, they were they were socialists, truly, and in Germany and in Italy, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4544.56s)]
*  and there was there was you couldn't tell where the German government ended and crops began. And [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4551.360000000001s)]
*  you know what I mean? And that's bad. I thought it was bad then I think it's bad now. And I hate [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4556.32s)]
*  to see it happen here. What's funny to say that, because last week at the Council on Foreign [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4560.08s)]
*  Relations, I think the panel was titled reflections on a on a reflections on the post Soviet era [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4566.16s)]
*  and implications for the modern day is Council on Foreign Relations. And one of the questions [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4572.88s)]
*  asked the panelists directly was there was a deep state in Russia in the 1990s, these oligarchs. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4577.36s)]
*  Yes. And we lost control over Russia, they're basically analogizing Trump to Putin. And they're [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4586.96s)]
*  saying, we had we had all this control, we total control over Russia during the Boris Yeltsin period. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4595.04s)]
*  And we had all these relationships with the Russian oligarchs. But then Putin had a natural [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4600.48s)]
*  advantage as being the head of state was somehow able to take over the Russian deep state and then [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4606.16s)]
*  we lost control over Russia. This is this is right. This is like the heart of it that nobody ever says. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4613.36s)]
*  It's Putin's decision to decapitate the oligarchy. That's the reason they hate him. Well, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4620.0s)]
*  what they say is that he also co opted it and got the oligarchy working for him rather than for [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4626.4s)]
*  outside. And in the meantime, the Russian economy recovered and life expectancy went up and alcoholism [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4634.0s)]
*  went down and like it became a beautiful country. The oligarchy wasn't serving Russia. That's kind [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4637.92s)]
*  of the point. Well, and the punchline to this is, at the end of setting this question up, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4641.76s)]
*  the guy at Council on Foreign Relations asks, so with those lessons, given that that's what happened [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4648.24s)]
*  with Putin, how can we preserve the deep state against Trump to save so that the deep state can [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4654.32s)]
*  save us? This is sick. This is sick. But again, look at like, you know, Chubais and the Russian [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4661.04s)]
*  oligarchs that were working directly with the with USAID and the Harvard Institute for International [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4667.92s)]
*  Development. And it's the same thing with with Brown and Root. That story of Brown and Root and [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4673.28s)]
*  Soros in Gabon in the 1970s. It was the same thing in Russia there where we justified because it was [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4678.48s)]
*  in US national security and national interests to make Russia a democracy and to privatize all their [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4686.16s)]
*  state owned assets. USAID paid half a billion dollars to the Harvard Institute for International [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4693.5199999999995s)]
*  Development. Again, another one of these universities that's delegated by the US government [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4698.96s)]
*  to go deeper into Russian society than the US government was wanted to be seen doing. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4704.0s)]
*  Very clever name, right? US Agency for International Development pays the Harvard [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4710.0s)]
*  Institute for International Development. It's just a Harvard spawn of USAID in order to work with [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4714.56s)]
*  Chubais and all these Russian oligarchs so that the Russian oligarchs got rich selling at discount [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4720.56s)]
*  bargain basement prices all these Russian state held assets in non-competitive bids where only [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4730.32s)]
*  two outside bidders were allowed to participate. The Harvard Management Fund for the Harvard [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4736.4s)]
*  Endowment and the George Soros Quantum Fund. So it's just looting. It's looting. And by the way, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4741.68s)]
*  really the country, I mean look at the numbers. The life expectancy for men in Russia in [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4747.92s)]
*  1996 was like 55. I mean it was awful, awful to do that to people. What did your average Russian do [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4755.04s)]
*  wrong? They lived through 70 years of communism and this is what you do to them once they're [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4764.4800000000005s)]
*  liberated. It's like it's really a moral crime. And part of that issue is as they were driving [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4768.64s)]
*  our own country on a similar path, they expressed the exact same contempt that someone would try to [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4776.96s)]
*  do something to stop it. And the other thing is they fully acknowledged it was a deep state before [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4783.360000000001s)]
*  Putin. They were just mad that they lost control of the deep state, which is why they were so [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4787.68s)]
*  why a lot of these actions by the early Trump administration have terrified them around [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4793.280000000001s)]
*  co-opting parts of the business community. Exactly. They hate, for example, Elon Musk. They made this [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4799.6s)]
*  whole campaign to drive Elon away or to go after Tesla. The reaction to Jeff Bezos, for example, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4804.240000000001s)]
*  and his posture around reorienting the Washington Post and so on. The Bill Crystal class was [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4812.16s)]
*  apoplectic that these commercial drivers in the sort of business community, but really these are [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4818.4s)]
*  the private for-profit sector, that they would go along with Trump's foreign policy agenda, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4827.36s)]
*  with Trump's reforms, maybe to be in Trump's good graces. But the fact is that that state, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4832.799999999999s)]
*  which was such a powerful asset to them, they do not want that handed off to somebody who might [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4837.5199999999995s)]
*  oppose them. The same reason that they didn't want Matt Gaetz at the Justice Department. They [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4844.16s)]
*  weaponized that Justice Department under Merrick Garland. They don't want that baton handed off to [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4849.36s)]
*  someone else. It's not that they have a problem with corruption at the Justice Department. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4854.88s)]
*  They want a monopoly on that corruption. So you're describing the mobilization of, you know, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4858.0s)]
*  all the various arms of the US government, but the NGO community against Russia. And I thought you [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4865.599999999999s)]
*  made a really, really wise observation that too few make that Putin's original sin wasn't really [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4870.24s)]
*  lusting after Poland. That's a lie. It was kicking out the oligarchs and taking control of his own [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4876.08s)]
*  country, which a lot of people hated in the West. So here's the part where I feel like the NGOs [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4882.5599999999995s)]
*  destabilized the United States. Like the war against Russia has been waged for over 10 years, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4890.0s)]
*  now really by the NGOs. Yes, completely. And they were, you know, as we discussed, they were [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4899.04s)]
*  authorized, deputized to do that. We talked about the Harvard Endowment, the Harvard Institute for [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4907.2s)]
*  International Development by the Open Society Foundation, which was simultaneously doing its [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4913.2s)]
*  civil society work, funding scientists, funding universities, funding the intellectual class, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4920.16s)]
*  funding the students. And then simultaneously Soros is operating a hedge fund that is buying up [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4926.32s)]
*  the assets of the Russian government. And, you know, of the failed Soviet state. Yes, yes. And [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4933.759999999999s)]
*  this relationship is, I mentioned to you just now that there's a funny story about Soros in Mongolia [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4940.96s)]
*  and the State Department in Mongolia that is like almost the perfect encapsulation of this [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4949.2s)]
*  to see how this plays out in every country, whether it's Russia or whether it's Poland or whether it's [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4957.28s)]
*  Hungary, you name it. But Mongolia had discovered in the early 2000s the world's largest copper mine. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4965.92s)]
*  It's got the Uyghur mine. And this was by far the biggest mine ever discovered. Mongolia is the [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4973.44s)]
*  biggest mine in the world, primarily copper, some gold too. And a company called Ivanhoe [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4984.72s)]
*  went in to negotiate a deal for the rights over that mine in tandem with Mongolian government. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=4993.360000000001s)]
*  And the U.S. So I found this in a State Department cable looking up all the Soros and Open Society [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5001.6s)]
*  Foundation things. I believe the cable is from 2007. And it describes how this deal could yield [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5009.92s)]
*  billions of billions of dollars and could massively transform the entire Mongolian economy. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5020.0s)]
*  It could like double their entire GDP with a single mine. And how there was an interest in [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5026.8s)]
*  making sure that this mine was acquired by Western companies rather than Chinese or Russians. And [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5033.2s)]
*  in the context of this, the State Department references a pivotal Open Society Foundation [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5042.639999999999s)]
*  Mongolia memo that had caught fire in the Mongolian press and was weighing heavily on [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5050.72s)]
*  public conversation about whether or not the Mongolian government would sign this deal with [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5057.52s)]
*  Ivanhoe or with the company for this. And the Soros Foundation rights and the State Department [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5066.160000000001s)]
*  backs this in this cable. They basically say, yes, this is all correct. Basically, the Mongolian [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5073.52s)]
*  government wanted deal terms and was about to pass something hastily in parliament to secure a deal [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5080.4s)]
*  that the Open Society Foundation said was too extractive on behalf of the Mongolian government. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5088.879999999999s)]
*  That basically the Mongolian government had problems with corruption. They also mentioned [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5094.5599999999995s)]
*  that the deal might have environmental impact in terms of the mine and its environmental impact on [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5101.44s)]
*  the ecosystem of Mongolia. And they give seven reasons in this memo that the Mongolian parliament [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5109.84s)]
*  has to be stopped from doing this deal on these terms. So this is a- [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5118.88s)]
*  And can I just ask, the mine is in Mongolia. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5126.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's in Mongolia. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5128.72s)]
*  And the Mongolian parliament is the Mongolian government. So George Soros, who's from Hungary [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5129.6s)]
*  but has British and American citizenship, is telling the Mongolians they shouldn't be able [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5135.04s)]
*  to do what they want with their own mine. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5138.96s)]
*  Maybe I'll start with the punchline first to make it way more sense. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5141.28s)]
*  I mean, it's so, the presumption there is a bit much. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5144.08s)]
*  The punchline is in 2009, the George Soros Management Fund purchased an absolutely huge [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5149.2s)]
*  stake in that very company. Come on. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5155.44s)]
*  Yes, yes. It changed its name to Rio Tinto, but it was called Ivanhoe while it was negotiating [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5158.24s)]
*  this deal. Now, the Open Society Foundation, they published an 174 page document which went through [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5163.28s)]
*  everything they did inside of Mongolia to kill the deal in 2007. And what they described is that [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5171.44s)]
*  they networked with all these Mongolian members of parliament. They used their media NGO, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5180.88s)]
*  their nonprofit organizations, their advocacy groups, their environmental NGOs to argue that [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5188.56s)]
*  the deal should be killed on environmental grounds. And this culminated and the Soros Foundation [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5195.84s)]
*  takes credit for its spawning street protests that destabilize the Mongolian government and [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5201.68s)]
*  incentivize the parliament to not ink this deal. And again, the Soros Foundation logic [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5208.88s)]
*  was that it was too extractive on the part of the Mongolian government. The Mongolian government [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5218.08s)]
*  was getting too good a deal from this. On their own mind, in their country. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5222.64s)]
*  Yes, in their country. And George Soros didn't own enough of it. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5227.360000000001s)]
*  So the US embassy in Mongolia is working with the Soros Network. Now they're doing it on national [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5230.0s)]
*  interest, national security grounds. They're saying, hey, if a Western company doesn't get this, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5237.200000000001s)]
*  China's right next door to Mongolia. They're big in the minerals, the metals space. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5242.0s)]
*  We don't want to lose this mine, the biggest copper mine in the world to a Chinese competitor. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5247.92s)]
*  We want to make sure a Westerner gets this deal. But the Open Society Foundation, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5254.400000000001s)]
*  which is underneath the, now it's the nonprofit side of the Soros Management Fund. The Open Society [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5259.04s)]
*  Foundation is saying, hey, kill this deal because the company is not getting enough money out of [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5267.4400000000005s)]
*  this. And then as soon as they kill that and get more profit secured for the mining company, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5273.28s)]
*  the Soros Management Fund buys up the equity way before everybody else. You can read about this. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5283.44s)]
*  No matter what happened with the mine, he would have like doubled his profit. I think it went from [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5292.16s)]
*  nine cents to 17 cents before a deal was even inked or before they even got to one of the [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5295.92s)]
*  development stages of it simply because everybody else hearing the news about this rushed into it. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5300.8s)]
*  But Soros had already bought up the stock because his own NGOs were on the ground, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5306.0s)]
*  midwifing the entire process with the full force and credit of the US government driving. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5311.4400000000005s)]
*  This is going to happen in Ukraine, isn't it? Oh, I'm sure it's happened all over the country. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5316.8s)]
*  The Ukraine rebuilding fund from BlackRock. I mean, this is, so if I want a piece of the [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5321.04s)]
*  trillion dollars that's going to be spent to make Ukraine a country again, and a piece of its [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5328.0s)]
*  resources, which are substantial, then I'm probably going to use NGOs on my behalf, right? [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5334.64s)]
*  Yes. And this is where you get this curious line around gongos, government-organized NGOs, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5341.36s)]
*  and ongos, I guess, these oligarch-organized NGOs, and where they all sort of meet in the middle [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5350.32s)]
*  and where they meet in the middle is, I guess, what we just call politics, the topography of [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5358.16s)]
*  political factions in the US in the sense that every major company has an interest in sponsoring [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5365.6s)]
*  NGOs that regardless of whether they believe in the mission of it, they advance something that [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5377.12s)]
*  helps the business side of this. So I mentioned Brown and Root had the Brown Foundation, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5382.96s)]
*  and the Soros Management Fund has the Open Society Foundation, and Microsoft has the [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5389.52s)]
*  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The last one was a little bit tongue in cheek, but [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5399.44s)]
*  what I'm getting at here is, take the example of this Mongolia mine. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5405.52s)]
*  The Soros didn't care about the environmental impact of that Mongolia mine. The fact that they [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5409.839999999999s)]
*  could astroturf environmental protesters to take to the streets and to create a human rights [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5417.839999999999s)]
*  predicate as to why the international community should intervene to stop the Mongolian government [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5424.16s)]
*  from signing this deal was simply an NGO. Now, if the US government did that, that would have to [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5428.48s)]
*  come straight from the CIA. That would be a covert action if you're going to run through [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5438.64s)]
*  front groups. But if you have an ostensibly public one, but you're not seeing the classified State [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5442.0s)]
*  Department cables or whatever's CIA underneath that, making an argument from their Asia desk, [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5447.92s)]
*  well, this is going to help US national security because that's less minerals for China. But then [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5453.04s)]
*  Soros is using that money and sponsoring. It's unbelievable. So the real fear, though, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5458.4s)]
*  is that that could happen inside our borders. That this combination of [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5464.96s)]
*  government actors, strict government actors from the executive branch agencies and NGOs collude [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5471.599999999999s)]
*  to take down a president. Well, that's correct, right? So they stage a little Mongolia right here [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5478.32s)]
*  in the US. Yes. And they're all the same groups. They're all the same groups. And a great example [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5487.2s)]
*  of this, we're talking about the US Institute of Peace. The US Institute of Peace, we talked about [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5492.24s)]
*  in the context of Syria and how they were openly funding the Taliban and lobbying the Taliban to [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5497.2s)]
*  keep 95% of the world's opium flowing after the Taliban took over. You know how high heroin prices [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5504.0s)]
*  would go if they shut that down? I mean, I see their point. Right. Yeah, more for the rest of it. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5510.32s)]
*  It's unbelievable. But they, so they are involved in these astroturfed NGO [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5515.76s)]
*  rent to riots very heavily. If you go to the publications page, the Institute of Peace, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5523.76s)]
*  yes, the US Institute of Peace. Now you have to understand they have a term for this. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5528.64s)]
*  Get ready for it. Nonviolent action. That's the term. Now, if you have to say that you're nonviolent, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5533.68s)]
*  right? You're probably a little bit, you know, I'm not like nonviolently drinking this water. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5542.4800000000005s)]
*  No, no, you're not. But you have to understand where this came. So this came from [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5549.52s)]
*  this same military network. We talked about how the origin point for this was 1948. UN declaration [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5554.72s)]
*  of human rights forbids military conquest, territorial accession by military force. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5561.68s)]
*  The UN Charter that 1948 establishes the NGO framework at the international level, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5566.5599999999995s)]
*  intergovernmentally. 1948 is also when the CIA inaugurates organized political warfare [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5572.719999999999s)]
*  through the use of NGOs. But right at this time, you have, sorry, one second. I just, I had a [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5578.719999999999s)]
*  second thought that just crapped up on this. We were talking about the US Institute of Peace. So [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5587.12s)]
*  right at this time, you have this move from direct military force to topple governments through [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5591.44s)]
*  military coups or through military takeovers or through getting military defectors to, instead of [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5600.5599999999995s)]
*  a top-down attempt to induce regime change, they created a blueprint. This is the first time [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5608.5599999999995s)]
*  we've seen a government-induced regime change. They created a blueprint. This is the famous [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5617.2s)]
*  color revolution blueprint, the people-powered revolution, lots of names for this, which is the [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5621.679999999999s)]
*  bottom-up method, which instead of getting at the military level with tanks and guns and fighter [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5627.12s)]
*  jets, you do it at the paramilitary street level. You shut down the country by getting a critical [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5636.0s)]
*  mass of its civil society organizations to not cooperate with that government. So the government [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5642.88s)]
*  can't bring in any revenue. They can't pay their own police officers or members of the military to [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5649.6s)]
*  quell the riots because there's no money in the government coffers, because they'll be sanctioned [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5655.12s)]
*  by the international community for cracking down on the protesters, and because the country itself [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5659.76s)]
*  is not, the hospital workers have walked out. The public health industry workers have walked out. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5664.8s)]
*  The schools aren't open. The hospitals aren't open. The roads are being blockaded. The only way to [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5671.12s)]
*  get rid of these people is either with hundreds of thousands of police officers in every region [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5675.360000000001s)]
*  to drag them or to kill them, in which case you have the human rights violations, and then [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5681.12s)]
*  every person is kicked off the SWIFT system and the international finance system and [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5685.360000000001s)]
*  sanctions and threats of a military intervention at that point. So this was pioneered by the US [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5689.4400000000005s)]
*  military, this paramilitary street technique that they call nonviolent action. This was done [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5696.8s)]
*  through Gene Sharp and his cohorts. It was at the Harvard CIA, incidentally, the Harvard Center [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5704.400000000001s)]
*  for International Affairs. It's a very cute nickname. Henry Kissinger was there, recruited [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5712.56s)]
*  Gene Sharp. They got $50 million in Pentagon funding to develop the playbook that they now [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5719.6s)]
*  call From Dictatorship to Democracy, the idea that you can use mass NGO action to organize the unions, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5726.96s)]
*  the trade workers, the laborers, the media organizations, every aspect of civil society [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5735.6s)]
*  in order to encircle the government, to cut it off from its own sources of power, and then with the [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5742.56s)]
*  sitting government effectively paraplegic, quadriplegic, basically cut off from its arms and legs, [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5749.76s)]
*  it would be ousted by a street protest that effectively surrounds the Capitol and takes over [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5758.08s)]
*  the buildings. I mean, this is basically, it's a January 6 blueprint, if what they said about [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5766.8s)]
*  January 6 was actually true, which of course is not. But everyone can watch bringing down a dictator, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5770.4800000000005s)]
*  the PBS documentary about the State Department and US Institute of Peace, [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5779.04s)]
*  their work getting the Oat Poor movement in Yugoslavia to topple Slobodan Milosevic. That was [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5784.96s)]
*  nonviolent action is what they call it. Now, the ending scene of that documentary, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5791.28s)]
*  you hear the whole documentary, it's, he says, nonviolent action, nonviolent action. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5795.04s)]
*  The climax of the documentary, which has soaring violins as if this is an amazing thing, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5799.2s)]
*  is the Parliament building, the Capitol building in Serbia being set on fire, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5809.44s)]
*  its windows smashed, and a throng of hundreds of thousands of angry street protesters [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5817.5199999999995s)]
*  flooding into the building and declaring themselves the new government. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5826.64s)]
*  This is cheered on by the State Department, USAID, the US Institute of Peace, the US Institute of [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5830.88s)]
*  Peace was actually on the ground training them. Meanwhile, the narrator, Martin Sheen is the [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5835.52s)]
*  narrator in this documentary, and he goes on to say, it's all about nonviolent action. And he says, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5843.76s)]
*  and that's what the Oat Poor wears all black. They have tight leather, they have a clenched [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5851.120000000001s)]
*  fist as their symbol. It is all intentionally sinister. It's like intentionally sinister, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5858.160000000001s)]
*  Molotov cocktails and police cars setting the Capitol building on fire, breaking the glass, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5864.48s)]
*  forcing the the democratically elected president to flee by Helivac out of the country. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5869.759999999999s)]
*  This is what they call nonviolent action. And just again, nonviolent action just means mob [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5876.719999999999s)]
*  violence action. But to them, that is less violent than bombing Sarajevo for you. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5882.16s)]
*  They're saying it's mostly peaceful. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5891.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes, mostly peaceful arson, mostly peaceful. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5894.0s)]
*  You're describing Black Lives Matter. It's kind of weird. I'm listening to this. I'm like, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5897.4400000000005s)]
*  if Black Lives Matter was not a synthetic group, if it wasn't AstroTurf, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5902.320000000001s)]
*  what happened to it? It disappeared as soon as its usefulness ended. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5909.12s)]
*  That's exactly what happened. And I can talk all about the connections of this network to that. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5913.84s)]
*  But I mean, it's the same. And I remember Darren Beatty saying at the very beginning of that, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5918.4800000000005s)]
*  this is a color revolution. And I love and respect Darren. But I didn't quite [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5922.8s)]
*  fully appreciate how true that was. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5928.8s)]
*  It's literally the exact same network. I have all of their planning documents from starting [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5930.72s)]
*  two weeks after the riots popped off, we can get into that whole thing with the Transition [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5937.040000000001s)]
*  Integrity Project and the US Institute of Peace Program on Nonviolent Action. Oh, incidentally, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5942.160000000001s)]
*  they were involved in that too? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5947.6s)]
*  Yes. And the International Center for Nonviolent Conflict was a big part of these, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5949.2s)]
*  how to leverage the BLM protests to shut the country down in case Trump won the 2020 election [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5955.04s)]
*  on Election Day 2020. They also work through the union groups, especially the AFL-CIO, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5962.96s)]
*  which is the top CIA conduit in the union space around the world. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5970.08s)]
*  Leftists in the 1960s used to call it the AFL-CIA. Remember, the AFL-CIO had a secret [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5974.32s)]
*  agreement with the Chamber of Commerce about protests to shut down the country. This is [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5978.96s)]
*  published in Time Magazine by Molly Ball. But on this US Institute... [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5983.5199999999995s)]
*  Talk about the Uniparty. When labor and management are both colluding against you, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5988.0s)]
*  you know what it is. The Chamber of Commerce. I mean, it really is, everything is the final [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5992.5599999999995s)]
*  scene in Animal Farm when the pigs and the farmers are indistinguishable from each other. It's like, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=5998.48s)]
*  that's the deep truth. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6002.4s)]
*  Yes. Yes. But both of them were threatened by Trump's foreign policy. The unions get [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6003.84s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars from the State Department, from USAID. We have multiple bureaus [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6009.2s)]
*  just for funding them. The Department of Labor is an international affairs bureau. We spent $20 [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6016.72s)]
*  million funding unions in 2023 alone in Brazil, the AFL-CIO's union groups. In just one country, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6020.72s)]
*  in one year, $20 million to the union groups there. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6030.24s)]
*  Kind of weird there was an election that year. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6034.16s)]
*  Yeah, kind of weird there. And it was specifically for [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6036.16s)]
*  mobilization of the unions and it helped them better organize themselves. Do you remember that [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6042.48s)]
*  Lula was the head of the Workers' Party? Remember who broke him out of jail? It was the AFL-CIO. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6046.719999999999s)]
*  Who did the AFL-CIO name the man of the year? I think it was in 2021 or 2022. They named Lula [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6053.04s)]
*  the man of the year. And what is the AFL-CIO? Not only was it directly sponsored by the Central [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6061.04s)]
*  Intelligence Agency for 30 years during the Cold War, but now they don't even need that because [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6070.16s)]
*  they have the CIA spinoff, National Endowment for Democracy, which has its own union branch called [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6076.0s)]
*  the Solidarity Center. The Solidarity Center is a formal part of AFL-CIO. It is inseparable from it [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6081.92s)]
*  and the Solidarity Center kicks them money. So what I'm saying is the Chamber of Commerce was [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6090.08s)]
*  threatened by a potential abandonment of cutting the wind for them, of Trump doing liberal [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6097.28s)]

*  On God's green earth, we would just go in, replace the government and then [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6112.72s)]
*  what would happen to AT&T if they couldn't get those contracts? What would happen to Amex if [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6117.76s)]
*  we didn't have USAID's DIA app in Ukraine? I'm sorry, I think it's Visa. So that Visa gets all [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6121.599999999999s)]
*  the credit card processing for all the transactions there. What would happen to Starbucks if we [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6127.76s)]
*  abandoned the USAID coffee programs in Peru and Colombia and the Central African Republic? What [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6135.44s)]
*  would happen to the petroleum companies if we didn't militarily step up our presence? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6142.08s)]
*  So the Chamber of Commerce and the unions, labor and management had a common enemy the same way [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6151.28s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans did when Trump first came on the scene because anyone who wants to [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6158.5599999999995s)]
*  put America first is going to run straight into everyone who wants to put their own interests first. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6163.04s)]
*  America be damned. Nicely put. So let's end by, well I hope you will end by explaining if you were to [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6171.28s)]
*  I don't know, defang these groups, drain the swamp as we say, who would you go after first [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6182.16s)]
*  and how would you do it to restore democracy to the country? The premise that the people rule, [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6188.64s)]
*  that elections matter, that there's the change people want when they get a new leader, that is democracy. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6193.04s)]
*  There's three layers of it. There's the executive branch layer, the legislative and the judicial. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6200.72s)]
*  On the executive branch layer, an unbelievable amount of positive accomplishments have been [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6206.72s)]
*  done through the executive branch and I think that the Trump admin deserves credit even as we're [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6217.12s)]
*  unsatisfied with how big this is and how many problems there have been with Congress and judges [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6225.679999999999s)]
*  blocking things. It took a lot of political capital to do what they did and they were aggressive at [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6231.04s)]
*  almost every layer of it with some very big asterisks and exceptions. The idea of the [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6239.36s)]
*  the firing of 14,000 people at USAID, the closure of the offices, the funding pauses [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6246.4s)]
*  was absolutely massive, both symbolically and in very very real terms. The restructuring that [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6253.12s)]
*  Marco Rubio has led at the State Department is absolutely massive. Like 135 sub-agencies are [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6260.08s)]
*  being riffed, totally killed, the reduction in force totally laid off so that you don't even need [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6266.5599999999995s)]
*  congressional approval because there's no job for fire people to go back to because the division [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6275.4400000000005s)]
*  doesn't exist anymore. Those include the Democracy, Rights and Labor Bureau at the State Department, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6280.160000000001s)]
*  which is the number one coordinating web, I guess in tandem with the International Organizations [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6286.64s)]
*  Bureau. But Democracy, Rights and Labor is the main place at State for the NGO plex because they're [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6292.64s)]
*  all getting this funding and they're all coordinating with the State Department and [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6302.0s)]
*  getting the protection of the State Department because they are promoting democracy as the [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6306.08s)]
*  State Department wants them to do. The rights in it stands for human rights because you know human [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6309.76s)]
*  rights violations in foreign countries and then labor is you know the unions and this is where [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6315.28s)]
*  you get the rental riots and all this. And you can go online and see weeping videos from people from [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6319.36s)]
*  the Democracy, Rights and Labor Bureau that they've been working there for 15, 20 years and suddenly [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6325.28s)]
*  it's gone and it's going to have a devastating impact. Of course it never has a devastating [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6331.2s)]
*  impact on these things. I mean great example is the AP ran a story about I think the initial title [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6334.72s)]
*  for it was Trump's move to end USAID crushes cocaine programs dedicated to combating the [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6342.72s)]
*  cocaine trade. The article is the biggest self-own you'll ever read. It's all about how [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6356.4s)]
*  you know we have all this money that goes to Colombia and to Peru and to Bolivia to stop [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6362.719999999999s)]
*  the cocaine, to stop drug trafficking in the you know Colombia is number one, Peru is number two, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6369.28s)]
*  biggest coca leaf you know cultivation in the world. It goes on to say we spend hundreds of [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6375.759999999999s)]
*  millions of dollars every year to cocaine is going to flourish. Then they have a statement [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6383.68s)]
*  that they include because they reached out to the president of Colombia. President Colombia says [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6388.240000000001s)]
*  we're thrilled that USAID is gone. They made the problem worse. Then they go to Peru and the [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6391.84s)]
*  number two coca leaf cultivator and they said the Peruvian government refused to comment [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6401.4400000000005s)]
*  but we talked to the former head of the national commission on you know narcotics prevention, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6411.04s)]
*  the former head of the part of the Peruvian government that handles this and he said thank [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6418.16s)]
*  God the USAID programs are on combating cocaine here are gone. They were the primary problem in [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6424.08s)]
*  this whole thing. Actually the and he gives an example he says actually not only did none of the [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6433.2s)]
*  money actually ever reach the groups but they only slowed down action that the Peruvian government [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6440.16s)]
*  tried to do. When the Peruvian government tried to do something to stop cocaine USAID would step in [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6445.36s)]
*  and they would delay things, they would drag things. It's almost like they wanted cocaine and [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6450.32s)]
*  then he gives the example of these he says and in Bolivia right next door Bolivia banned USAID in [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6453.599999999999s)]
*  2013 and they drastically reduced the cocaine trafficking and because there was no USAID cocaine [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6460.4s)]
*  program keeping the cocaine flowing and so anyway but what I'm saying is this is all done through [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6468.96s)]
*  these you know these state department bureaus which are now being reorganized and one of the [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6474.8s)]
*  so at the executive branch level I would say there's when we huge wins at the national science [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6480.4800000000005s)]

*  especially with Damon Wilson at the helm who came straight from the Atlanta council digital [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6508.24s)]

*  The Atlanta council where he came from at that time the Atlanta council was running training [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6524.96s)]
*  seminars to get journalists to flag Trump tweets including one seminar called I call bullshit [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6529.599999999999s)]

*  them through 11 different government agencies pay the Atlanta council. So why are they why why is [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6571.2s)]
*  Ned national number democracy Atlanta council why are they still getting government money? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6575.28s)]

*  branches the and then there the other two core fours are the exact other two groups who signed [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6608.32s)]
*  that secret agreement around organizing destabilizing street protests in case Trump won. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6614.96s)]

*  they that they've recognized how elements of what they were doing before were inappropriate [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6754.96s)]
*  they'd gone rogue that certain people who were there are not there anymore that they are trying [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6763.12s)]
*  to align the their actions with the foreign policy set by their sponsors the u.s government [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6768.32s)]

*  look i'm not weighing into whether or not they're doing it for cynical self-serving reasons or [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6782.24s)]
*  whether but frankly you could argue they may have been doing the other the bad stuff for [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6786.0s)]
*  because the biden administration wanted them you know to uh you know to do that or because the [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6789.679999999999s)]
*  you know trump was on shaky ground in his own first term and didn't really control his own congress or [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6795.12s)]
*  or budget or um or had a very strong coalition but the point is is ndi has not made those [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6801.28s)]
*  reforms at all the the solidary center has not made those reforms um and the issue is is if you [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6809.68s)]
*  if you say okay iri has reformed the republican branch of it has but these other three are still [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6817.6s)]

*  uh you know pre-91 the assumption was we're locked in a an existential struggle with the [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6861.12s)]
*  forces of darkness the soviets on board with that uh post-91 you know ultimately we came to realize [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6868.24s)]
*  that we run the entire world and that's like a huge management project to keep everything under [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6877.5199999999995s)]
*  control and sort of moving in the right direction and but you know we're in charge of the world [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6881.2s)]
*  and post 2023 there's like there's no way you can tell yourself that it's just not true [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6885.52s)]
*  and the bricks is now it represents a bigger economy bigger population bigger military than [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6895.120000000001s)]
*  the west so i guess my question is do the people running all these different groups [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6900.4800000000005s)]
*  understand that their 1980s era assumptions are just like overtaken by events do they see the [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6906.080000000001s)]
*  world clearly do they know the limits to their own power do they know what's up i think they do [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6911.84s)]
*  actually good um as i mentioned i'm i'm reading bill burns is autobiography the cia director for [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6917.68s)]
*  biden and very close friend of epstein's by the way no no just just a fact yes i know i just saw [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6924.72s)]
*  just saw emails from epstein to him yes someone showed me doesn't i think bill burns is a very [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6931.4400000000005s)]
*  smart guy and i'm not for bill burns but i'm not i'm just saying friend of epstein's yeah right but [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6936.96s)]
*  i think there is recognition of that and i think this is also why you see this everything is [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6944.4800000000005s)]
*  alliance based and why you see for example the biden administration moving so deeply in tandem [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6952.4800000000005s)]
*  with the eu on all things and using eu regulatory action to box out you know populists like the [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6958.72s)]
*  biden administration was totally behind the eu digital censorship act that is going to become [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6966.64s)]
*  it's completely yes literally i think i think their internal documents from their [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6971.200000000001s)]
*  white house information integrity working group um planning the whole thing as well as the us aid [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6975.68s)]
*  programs to to beef up the terms of it so that it can be used against domestic enemies in america [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6980.8s)]
*  but the fact is is i think this is this is part of the global alliance structure [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6987.12s)]
*  and i actually don't think that the biden administration really moved unilaterally [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=6995.28s)]
*  assuming unipolar power almost almost every major foreign policy decision [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7000.0s)]
*  you know would would have the buy-in of the uk france the in-power parties in germany and canada [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7006.88s)]
*  and paid very close attention to um to and and in fact you're partnering with in many many ways [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7015.04s)]
*  china i mean trump blocked china from being able to import oil and gas from iran he blocked that [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7024.24s)]
*  for four years two months into biden's term china inked the iran deal for 400 by 400 billion dollars [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7031.2s)]
*  of oil and gas from iran it's just i so i don't think there is a kind of [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7039.68s)]
*  as much of the unipolar there is some of it definitely like you hear the john bolton types [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7046.320000000001s)]
*  you know talk about uh you know almost presupposing that we can just bully everyone around [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7052.0s)]
*  but i think even that is done with an expectation that it's going to be nato wide it's going to have [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7057.52s)]
*  you know allies around the world but but i to your point i think that the ukraine [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7063.84s)]
*  russia war and you know is has been a humbling period which i think is why there actually is [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7072.72s)]
*  an appetite for peace even within many aspects of the blob they just want peace on terms [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7080.8s)]
*  that are beyond their leverage to obtain and um you know that that is a war of attrition [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7090.32s)]
*  that you know gets back to the the efforts to cut usaid and the ngoplex usaid spent 15 billion [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7099.28s)]
*  dollars i think it was one year alone on on ukraine on this usaid ngo's are funding the [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7108.0s)]
*  pensions of people in ukraine are are funding the the salaries of municipal workers [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7119.12s)]
*  there's more welfare for people in ukraine from usaid than you know effectively american citizens [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7128.08s)]
*  who live here legally and but the fact is is if that usaid spigot gets cut things will go south [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7135.12s)]
*  very quickly this is why the eu is creating its own army you know built a trillion dollar budget [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7143.44s)]
*  that they've announced that for the eu to you know effectively create a parallel nato in case trump [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7148.5599999999995s)]
*  dips out of that but in the heat of this you know i mentioned a few of the failings one of them ned [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7154.5599999999995s)]
*  another one is a trillion dollar pentagon budget um is is a is hard for me to imagine [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7160.5599999999995s)]
*  that that does not go to prolonging the war but the trump administration is a tough choice if you [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7169.839999999999s)]
*  totally deprive ukraine of the lifeline that they've had everything crumbles immediately but then [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7175.759999999999s)]
*  uh you lose the the deal terms you in the sense that there's no hope to have [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7183.52s)]
*  territory in eastern ukraine uh you know flow back to control by the key of government [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7193.04s)]
*  there's no hope to recover the all the petroleum resources in ukraine ukraine is the third largest [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7198.64s)]
*  uh shale or reserves i believe in all of europe and especially in the donbass and uh off off [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7204.64s)]
*  the offshore uh in crimia and the black sea and so you know i think trump is is between a blob [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7212.88s)]
*  and a hard place you know he he has to if he wants a budget done he needs congress to approve we do [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7223.2s)]
*  not have a populous super majority in congress we have there are more populace now in congress than [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7229.6s)]
*  there were under trump one so i don't think trump will will get as rolled as he was by paul ryan [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7235.52s)]
*  but there will be rolling uh undoubtedly as we've seen 26 members of congress i think have said that [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7242.240000000001s)]
*  they're not going to approve the doge cuts just the doge cuts and while you're getting handed even [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7248.4800000000005s)]
*  more money from a from a trillion dollar pentagon budget and how much of that trillion is going to [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7255.360000000001s)]
*  be civil military i.e. ngos because the military funds these ngos as i mentioned the secretary of [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7259.68s)]
*  war is on the board for the u.s institute of peace the the pentagon pays the atlantic council [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7266.48s)]
*  the pentagon pays for nato which has all the social societal resilience and social cohesion [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7275.28s)]
*  grants to the ngos space to do all this and so a lot of you can shut down usaid but you can just [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7282.08s)]
*  call it civil civil military and the civil society ngos will be funded by the pentagon so [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7289.52s)]
*  trump has to keep his coalition together and so he he's he can't get everything he wants just as [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7298.0s)]
*  we're not a unipolar power anymore trump is not a unipolar president but so so i'm happy with [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7303.4400000000005s)]
*  singles and doubles as long as as long as the direction line is towards a better country [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7312.08s)]
*  the question is is are we even going to get the singles or doubles or is you know is the blob [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7322.8s)]
*  going to get enough home runs and triples on the other side of it that on net nothing comes to pass [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7328.48s)]
*  when you next come back i'd i'd love to hear what a trillion dollars a year buys [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7335.36s)]
*  considering that we're separated from our enemies by two oceans and face no invasion threat [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7342.08s)]
*  i'm thinking that's a pretty big budget and i know that i'm probably not a good republican [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7347.68s)]
*  for pointing that out but uh i guess i'm not a good republican in general but like what is that [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreRX4q_V3E&t=7352.72s)]
