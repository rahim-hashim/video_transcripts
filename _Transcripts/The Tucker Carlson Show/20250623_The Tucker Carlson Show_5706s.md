# Thank God Trump Brokered a Ceasefire. That’s the Last Thing Mark Levin Wanted.
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI)
*  Clayton Morris, ladies and gentlemen, we worked together at Fox News. You were there 10 years [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=0.0s)]
*  You've since gone on to be a lot more successful than either one of us that was at Fox and I think a lot happier and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5.72s)]
*  Congratulations. No one gets out of it alive except you [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=12.6s)]
*  And you know, it's it's it's great to beat the odds we both did but [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=15.84s)]
*  Is it weird to look at your former employer? You spent a decade working for them and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=21.44s)]
*  See them as like a prime driver for war [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=28.12s)]
*  It's not weird when if you look at history right to me when I started watching over the past few weeks [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=35.72s)]
*  this drumbeat for war I [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=44.56s)]
*  Started seeing it's almost like they went to their shelf and they grabbed their book their manual they got it off [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=47.92s)]
*  They dusted it off. Like what did we do back in 2002? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=54.0s)]
*  what have we done before that successfully worked and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  Pushed people an entire populace along with CNN and MSNBC [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=61.32s)]
*  Towards war they flipped open the pages [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=66.72s)]
*  They you know, they skipped pat they they skipped the preamble because they already knew you know what to do and they started lining up [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=69.52s)]
*  every show [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=76.8s)]
*  With the same rhetoric they started putting up the the TVs where they would stand and get up with their big pencils and their fingers [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=78.24s)]
*  On the board. Here's where they're going to attack. These are the bases almost giving like telegraphing military moves [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=85.88s)]
*  It's from the same playbook. So it's not stunning. That's called news coverage Clayton. That's news, right? I [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=91.92s)]
*  I [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=115.88s)]
*  Where is the journalism I I don't understand it but [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=121.0s)]
*  It is particularly this weekend it be I I became enraged this weekend [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  I'm not I'm not one to get enraged unless like my kids leave their shoes in the kitchen or [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=129.88s)]
*  One of my eight-year-old steals my phone charger. Like that's when I fly into a rage [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=134.2s)]
*  I don't even get road rage like I'm a pretty even-keeled person very even-keeled [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=137.84s)]
*  I can confirm that things could be happening all around me and I you know, I just I kind of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=141.62s)]
*  You know float along I got enraged this weekend [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=145.88s)]
*  Watching this coverage and almost breathlessly as soon as there was this announcement that that Trump had authorized this bombing of these nuclear sites [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=149.32s)]
*  It was it was almost as if like the hosts on these shows were like grabbing an American flag and anyone who opposed this was [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=157.6s)]
*  Unpatriotic and this was the most spectacular amazing American moment in history [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  He'll go down you like Reagan and Thatcher, you know attempting to bring down communism [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  Everyone tried to do this for decades Trump is the only one that could do it [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=175.78s)]
*  I just you know one of the hosts [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=179.78s)]
*  I just got off the phone with Trump a few minutes ago and he said their entire nuclear program has been decimated. It's done [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=182.18s)]
*  And I just couldn't believe what I was seeing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=188.34s)]
*  The people didn't vote for this no and to see these networks [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=192.66000000000003s)]
*  Pushing this coverage and it's not you know, just Fox its CNN [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=198.26s)]
*  It's MSNBC and they're all right back to their playbook because it's so incredibly profitable [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=201.76s)]
*  I mean just like follow the money on all of this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=206.12s)]
*  So if we wind I mean [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=209.12s)]
*  Contextually here. I don't know how you know much of your audience is aware of like what happened in 2002 2003 [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=211.12s)]
*  We were sort of in that world at the time [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=216.6s)]
*  You much more than me at that time, but I was part of the propaganda effort. Yeah [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=220.12s)]
*  I was part of the propaganda effort. Yeah, and you were it was it. Were you at MSNBC? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  I was at CNN the most trusted name in news. This is CNN. This is see ya [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=229.46s)]
*  so [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=235.74s)]
*  and you can't the American media was all in lockstep and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  You know that there are almost no dissenting voices allowed on the network news [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=242.3s)]
*  Let me repeat that there were almost no dissenting voices allowed on [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  Those shows across the board MSNBC we learned [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  Had a two-for-one [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=257.84s)]
*  booking [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=260.4s)]
*  Official booking plan that meant two pro war voices for every one anti-war voice [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=262.56s)]
*  But across the board, I mean shows okay, so that they actually were explicit about that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean producers who worked for for instance. I'm getting ahead of myself here because I'm just so [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=274.7s)]
*  It's all right. That's all right. I mean people [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=279.86s)]
*  This is not a debate over the next budget agreement. This is not a debate even over [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=282.62s)]
*  You know boys and girls sports. This is a debate over the future of the world and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=288.5s)]
*  Millions people could die. That's not a crazy [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=293.58s)]
*  Concern and so yeah, this really matters. I think it's fair to be worked up about I'm just trying to be [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=297.46s)]
*  Level-headed as much as I can be so I'm just gonna look at them [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=303.62s)]
*  I just want to talk about the facts here because I've looked I was I studied this very very closely at the time [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=307.08s)]
*  I was infuriated by the edit by the time when George W Bush would get up there and tell us, you know [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=311.76s)]
*  Why they attack, you know, it's because they hate why they hate us. It's cuz they hate our freedoms. I [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=317.68s)]
*  Mean my bullshit meter when I as soon as he said those words, I just wanted to scream at the television back then [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=323.04s)]
*  They don't hate us because of our freedoms. That's just garbage. What what why aren't they going? Why aren't they attacking Norway? I [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=329.4s)]
*  Went on CNN why repeated that as well? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=336.4s)]
*  For sure, and I kind of believed it and then I went over to the region right after 9-eleven and then a year later [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  I made the mistake of reading Osama bin Laden's manifesto on [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=345.76s)]
*  CNN not an endorsement of Osama bin Laden, obviously, right but it's news [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=351.2s)]
*  Well, I just think it's important to know why people do things you can disagree completely [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=356.0s)]
*  But I think it's important to be honest about other people's motives [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=360.32s)]
*  And so I read this maybe it's all made up or whatever. Can you trust Osama bin Laden? No, but I think [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=363.14000000000004s)]
*  Do I like Osama bin Laden? No, obviously [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  but I'm an American, but I think it's important to know why at least what he said about why he did it and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  The two reasons there are a number of reasons but the two big ones where you've got US forces on the Saudi Peninsula [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=381.22s)]
*  To [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=386.72s)]
*  Holy most holy cities in Islam Mecca Medina like that's offensive to me in his backyard [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=388.72s)]
*  Yeah, well right he's Saudi but also it's just like yeah symbolically offensive. I get it [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=395.0s)]
*  I don't agree but it's important to know that and by the way the US military moved its base out of Saudi Arabia after that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=399.92s)]
*  So like they took it seriously. Okay, it's you know unnecessarily provocative and the second reason was your own critical support of Israel [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=406.94s)]
*  So I read this on the air at CNN. Whoa. Whoa shouldn't have done that. I was immediately denounced as an anti-semite. What? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=415.32s)]
*  Okay, like you're reading Osama bin Laden's words and you are an anti-semite [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=423.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I got completely slammed by some group. I can't remember the name of it [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=428.2s)]
*  I was shocked by it [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=433.23999999999995s)]
*  But I I'm not endorsing Osama bin Laden. We had despised Osama bin Laden. He murdered three million American or 3,000 Americans. So whatever [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  You were not allowed to deviate from the talking points. I mean I experienced that right like for real [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=444.9s)]
*  No, you're not and you have to just not along and be like, yeah, okay [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=451.5s)]
*  I mean if you think about how ridiculous that is, you know, I had to read Mein Kampf in college, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=454.4s)]
*  We still read Hitler's words to understand. Yeah the move towards a final solution understanding bloodline all of that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  It's written in his own book so you can understand where he got to with this. It's important to understand. Yeah [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=466.44s)]
*  Historically I agree I don't endorse Hitler [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=472.62s)]
*  By the way, I'm with you on that Clayton glad we agree on that we do by the way [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=477.06s)]
*  I read that book in my history of the Holocaust class [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  You know who was taught? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=485.92s)]
*  My had a Jewish professor at the University of Pittsburgh was an incredible class [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=487.76s)]
*  But it's crazy to think the country's become so irrational partly because of training from cable news [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=491.26s)]
*  Yeah, that knowing something is considered the same as endorsing it, right? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=496.42s)]
*  And what it really is is an attempt to control your mind to control what you believe by limiting your access to information [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=501.86s)]
*  That's really what it is. Also what I find so offensive about at least cable news now is maybe it's always been this way [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=508.94s)]
*  I think it probably has but it's [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=515.04s)]
*  Incurious we can't ask. Yes, we can't ask questions. And if you ask questions, that's an endorsement of that position [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=518.34s)]
*  So like we hit these nuclear targets [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=527.08s)]
*  I would never if I were still on there and I raised the question with a guess like how do we know we actually [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=530.6s)]
*  Destroyed anything with these nuclear targets. Don't ask that question. You better not ask that question [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=536.2s)]
*  You may have heard about a recent proposal to finally protect Americans their privacy from data brokers from theft of your data [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=541.62s)]
*  It's needed badly every day tech vultures collect [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=549.14s)]
*  Information about everything you're doing online and then they sell it to the highest bidder. Obviously this should be illegal [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=554.86s)]
*  It's not illegal the new proposal being shot down ensures [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=559.82s)]
*  You're not gonna be protected anytime soon. And that's why you still need Express VPN [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=563.68s)]

*  You know and I felt like while I was there I was I was able to I [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=703.8s)]
*  Would get sky I think I would get side eyes from people but when I would question like the military industrial complex [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=708.84s)]
*  I'm sorry. Like why are we spending at this at the time was like six hundred billion dollars a year on a military industrial complex budget and [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=714.2s)]
*  All of these like a Boeing Northrop Grumman, they build factories in everyone's backyard [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=722.12s)]
*  So all the members of the House of Representatives every member of the Senate has like oh, I've got Boeing in my backyard [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=726.4000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's that's interesting because that's intentional that there's all of these military production facilities in your backyard [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=731.6800000000001s)]
*  So it's always in your backyard and I just became furious [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=738.08s)]
*  About I've always been furious about that [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=742.24s)]
*  I've always had a problem with that and so occasionally I would ask those questions of guests on the show and I could tell like [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=744.72s)]
*  It was not a favorable question to be asking about the military industrial didn't like it. Yeah, you know you knew and you knew [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=750.0s)]
*  There's a there's a lot of unsaid things, right? So I [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=758.1999999999999s)]
*  Don't exactly you know, I don't know where it comes from. Maybe the top [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=763.68s)]
*  I don't know [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=766.64s)]
*  I worked the morning so I was kind of in and out of there and I didn't really have like a lot of interaction with [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  Like suits, you know, I wasn't one of those types of people [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=771.56s)]
*  But you knew that when you were given sort of like this is what we're covering on the show today [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=775.04s)]
*  I don't see anything on here about [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=779.0s)]
*  800 billion dollars like in a defense budget or I don't see anything in here on our show. We've got a four-hour show, but we can't ask [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=783.4s)]
*  questions about [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=790.9599999999999s)]
*  Did we actually hit? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=792.92s)]
*  Nuclear weapons or did we actually hit is there anything in for dough when we hit it? I [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=795.4s)]
*  Don't see it. You know, I don't see any of that in here [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=800.76s)]
*  So you knew what sort of the agenda would be for the day? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=803.56s)]
*  Did you ever know but no one ever told me what to say, you know, it's gonna be great [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=807.28s)]
*  But it's it's like you show up [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=811.38s)]
*  I'm being disingenuous because I had the same job that you had so I know the answer to this question [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=813.56s)]
*  But it's just people may not understand how this works. So you show up and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=817.1999999999999s)]
*  Like everything's prepared for you [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=821.48s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not a matter of telling you what to say or what not to say [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  It's all kind of written that you're guided in a certain direction. Just right. Did you ever figure out who was making those decisions? I [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=826.9200000000001s)]
*  Didn't know [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=834.48s)]
*  Did you because again I was a I considered myself? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=836.2s)]
*  I never really got along with like the suits types, you know, I get uncomfortable I think in that environment [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=843.44s)]
*  You know if I have to wear a suit, I cannot wait to take it off, you know [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=850.48s)]
*  So I I don't know those people [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  By I don't have dinner with those people if I have to see them occasionally to kind of talk about something [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=857.64s)]
*  It's incredibly uncomfortable for me. So [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=863.0s)]
*  No [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  But so I don't have the answer to that I could assume but maybe you have a better [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=867.88s)]
*  Clare no, no, I know where they come it comes from the family that owns it for sure. I [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=873.0s)]
*  Mean I watched it I did have dinner suits a lot. Yeah, you knew that world so much [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=878.84s)]
*  From a suit world. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=885.56s)]
*  No, the Murdoch's made those decisions who I really liked to this day like the Murdochs but not against the Murdochs [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=888.48s)]
*  but it's just a fact that they did do that and and [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=894.24s)]
*  And they overruled their people on questions of war. I [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=898.6s)]
*  Remember and I think was 2002 pretty sure was 2012 [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=903.36s)]
*  Roger Ailes was running and wonderful man wonderful man flawed guy, but wonderful. I [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=906.76s)]
*  Really liked him and admired him [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=913.5600000000001s)]
*  personally [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=916.16s)]
*  Others disagree, but I still feel it. But anyway, he had this guy called Andrew Napolitano judge nap [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=917.24s)]
*  Did you ever run into him? Yeah. Yeah, what a nice guy just a really nice guy like everyone liked [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=924.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. I still really like him a lot. But anyway, he had this show [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=928.68s)]
*  Judging freedom maybe yeah, and he's more of a libertarian. I would exactly he was hired as a libertarian [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=932.5200000000001s)]
*  Well, he's a strict libertarian. It's an absolute constitutional like stay out of other countries 100% [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=938.08s)]
*  He's yeah, he's kind of a more [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=943.48s)]
*  Erudite Thomas Massey. Yeah, the same basic politics not a hater at all. She's a nice man [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=946.48s)]
*  but anyway, he made some anti-war noises on his show and [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=952.2800000000001s)]
*  And basically said, you know, why are we supporting all the other countries? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=957.84s)]
*  Like why are we doing this? Whoa, he lost his show over it and a bunch of people came to Roger Ailes [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=961.16s)]
*  I remember I talked to him about it at the time and [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  demanded that he fire judge Napolitano over this Wow and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=971.36s)]
*  And ultimately they just stripped him of his show but kept him around as a contributor for another four or five years [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=976.68s)]
*  As I remember I may be getting some of the details wrong, but I but that's basically what happened. They took a show away [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=982.16s)]
*  I always wondered what happened. Oh my gosh. He was like I had I loved watching that [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=986.72s)]
*  Show. Oh, it's great. Like I didn't interesting to you. He's really smart. Oh man, they and I remember thinking oh, that's the red line [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=991.08s)]
*  They don't care if you get up there and you're like, I think you know, whatever said some controversial racial opinion or you know [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=999.36s)]
*  They'd be like, ah, that's a little hot. Maybe not don't go there you express [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1006.08s)]
*  You know an opinion about our foreign policy that they don't like we're done now [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1010.9200000000001s)]
*  Like they are totally serious about that [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1014.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, you knew Roger Ailes used to watch the our show religiously on the weekend because he was home and the joke was well [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1017.5s)]
*  If you own a network or you run a network, what do you do on the weekend? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1022.62s)]
*  What you wake up and have coffee you watch your shows [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1025.42s)]
*  You know [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1027.3999999999999s)]
*  so we he [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1027.82s)]
*  was a joke that he would watch our [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1028.62s)]
*  Fox and Friends weekend show more than just about any other show on the network because it was Saturday morning [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1030.62s)]
*  He was waking up with coffee. So he would call into the booth all the all the time, you know [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1035.2s)]
*  He about a graphic being wrong. He was [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1038.86s)]
*  Very very cautious, but no one ever told me what to say or anything [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1041.3799999999999s)]
*  There was one time where I criticized Mark Zuckerberg and I called him a scumbag on the air [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1045.4199999999998s)]
*  Hi fair fair and I got a talking to about that like we don't use the term scumbag and I was like, oh I'm from [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1050.3799999999999s)]
*  Philly I thought that was like that's kind of like that's how you talk, you know, I'm sorry [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1056.3799999999999s)]
*  No, we have moms and with their children use the word scumbag. Okay got it. I'll refrain from calling Zuckerberg a scumbag [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1060.6399999999999s)]
*  but I [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1067.4199999999998s)]
*  Mean it makes sense to me [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1069.5800000000002s)]
*  I never hit that red line in that way because as you pointed out you're being guided a certain way [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1070.88s)]
*  So all of the segments for those of your viewers that don't understand like, you know, you have a card [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1076.28s)]
*  You'd have like a packet, you know of maybe like ten articles regarding the segment [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1081.74s)]
*  You're about to do and every segments like four minutes long [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1086.76s)]
*  So you and I can talk for two hours every segment is like four minutes long [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1090.54s)]
*  Then you've got a commercial break and you might have two guests during that time. So you're maybe it's a debate [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1096.68s)]
*  Can you really have a debate in four minutes? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1103.0s)]
*  No, so you have a debate and always the other person's always sort of set up for failure to begin with anyway, but and [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1105.04s)]
*  You're sort of guided in what their what their positions are, you know that John Smith [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1112.5600000000002s)]
*  He he believes this and you know, Sarah whatever it knows that believes this and [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1117.8s)]
*  You kind of go from there if you deviate from that that's when you know, you have problems [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1124.1200000000001s)]
*  So that's you're guided through the whole day like that. And that's why this weekend when we were watching this coverage [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1128.5200000000002s)]
*  I was not surprised as they would sort of handoff coverage from show to show to show to show. It's all the same [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1134.5800000000002s)]
*  Trump all the same Trump did the most amazing thing ever. He carried out. He you know, he destroyed Iran's nuclear infrastructure [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1141.4s)]
*  This is amazing. Oh, and by the way, if you're anti [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1149.3600000000001s)]
*  If you're anti this attack on Iran, that's the new message now, then you're unpatriotic. We are pro Iran. You're pro Iran [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1153.88s)]

*  You're here. You're pro Islamic terror. You're a bigot [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1166.64s)]
*  What say it just reminds me so much of Black Lives Matter in 2020. Oh, yeah, we're on the other side [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1171.44s)]
*  Of course, I certainly was and Fox was [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1176.76s)]
*  Generally, they don't want to talk about it. Mm-hmm [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1180.4s)]
*  Pro Black Lives Matter actually if I'm being totally honest, but I was completely opposed to it from day one [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1183.8000000000002s)]
*  Just because I thought it was irrational and destructive [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1188.4s)]
*  and stupid [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1192.1200000000001s)]
*  But it's the same impulse. It's like this hysteria sweeps over America [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1193.68s)]
*  fanned by the media Fox being a big part of that the biggest media and [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1200.5200000000002s)]
*  Anyone who disagrees is just written off as a hater like they go right to motive [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1207.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh, you must be taking money from reform power. You must hate this or that group. There's no like even attempt to [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1212.36s)]
*  Engage with what you're saying. It's like this write you off. Just like it's it's the same as shut up racist, right? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1220.6799999999998s)]
*  You can't ask questions about Black Lives Matter being a corrupt organization stealing money, which is [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1227.24s)]
*  You're a racist. How dare you ask that question? It's Black Lives Matter [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1234.08s)]
*  We literally paint Black Lives Matter on intersections [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1237.36s)]
*  Like how dare you talk about the the folks that are running it are actually stealing money. It's a corrupt organization [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1240.06s)]
*  You can't you can't bring that up. We're sorry to say it, but this is not a very safe country walk through Oakland or Philadelphia [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1246.02s)]
*  Yeah, good luck [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1251.8999999999999s)]
*  So most people they think about this want to carry a firearm and a lot of us do [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1253.82s)]
*  The problem is there can be massive consequences for that ask Kyle Rittenhouse Kyle written has got off in the end [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1258.82s)]
*  But he was innocent from the first moment [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1264.32s)]
*  It was obvious on video and he was facing life in prison anyway, that's [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1266.0600000000002s)]
*  What the anti-gun movement will do they'll throw you in prison for defending yourself for the firearm [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1271.38s)]
*  And that's why a lot of Americans are turning to Berna [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1275.7s)]
*  It's a proudly American company Berna makes self-defense launchers that hundreds of law enforcement departments trust [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1278.8200000000002s)]
*  They've sold over six hundred thousand pistols mostly to private citizens who refuse to be empty-handed [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1285.3400000000001s)]
*  These pistols and I have one fire rock-hard kinetic rounds or tear gas rounds and [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1291.02s)]
*  Peppered projectiles and they stop a threat from up to 60 feet away. There are no background checks [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1296.66s)]
*  There are no waiting periods Berna can ship it directly to your door [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1301.5s)]
*  You can't be arrested for defending yourself with a Berna pistol visit Berna [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1305.5s)]
*  Byrna.com or your local sportsman's warehouse to get your stay Berna.com [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1311.18s)]
*  What's so hilarious and I guess I shouldn't be surprised because they always accuse you of being exactly the way that they themselves are [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1316.5s)]
*  Is anyone who asked questions or disagrees is woke now? Have you noticed this the woke, right? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1322.66s)]
*  So like I'm not sure that we should have a war with Iran right now and like seem like there were a lot of problems [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1328.98s)]
*  Here and like people I know are dying of drug odys [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1336.22s)]
*  Shut up racist. You're woke. It's like wait what? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1339.1s)]
*  Or people who are clearly working on behalf of a foreign country accuse you of working on behalf of a foreign country [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1343.5s)]
*  It's so amazing because well so many of these were former left-wing. Oh, yeah, that's the thing, right? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1348.5s)]
*  So these neo cons let's be honest right there. They were left-wing. Oh, yeah, so [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1355.26s)]
*  they have now taken the moral high ground to tell me that I'm I'm part of the woke, right because [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1360.38s)]
*  Because I [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1367.66s)]
*  Don't want us to intervene in a foreign [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1368.98s)]
*  So I guess George by that measure then George Washington is a member of the woke right in his farewell address telling the nation [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1371.18s)]
*  We shouldn't intervene in foreign affairs of other countries [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1377.18s)]
*  So I thought wokeness was a euphemism for engaging in identity politics. It's identity politics [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1380.06s)]
*  What matters most is your identity right ethnic religious, whatever racial? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1385.66s)]
*  The people who are using the term woke, right? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1390.9s)]
*  Or practicing like the most vicious kind of identity politics I've ever seen it makes the [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1394.14s)]
*  The Black Lives Matter people seem like amateurs which they are of course [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1398.9s)]
*  I mean, this is serious identity politics like you disagree. You're a Nazi, right? What's that? But identity politics [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1403.14s)]
*  Well, and it's also being described as like insidious like you're not aware that you're anti-semitic. You're so anti-semitic now [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1410.26s)]
*  Like Tucker, I don't know if you know just the way that you dress today is now anti-semitic or just it's unconscious bias [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1417.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. I mean I literally heard this five years ago from the left and now we hear you know [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1423.46s)]
*  You're racist that knowing it you don't need to have to be aware of your bad attitudes [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1428.7s)]
*  You just exude them. We heard this five years ago from the left and literally driving here. I [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1433.78s)]
*  Heard it on Glenn Beck's radio show [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1439.42s)]
*  Glenn Beck said the exact same thing and I like Glenn Beck. Oh, I love Glenn [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1441.82s)]
*  He's an amazing he said but he said most people now it's a sort of a saw and he's exact wording Glenn [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1445.06s)]
*  Don't be mad at me, but it was like he'll admit it [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1451.34s)]
*  That we're now be it's it's like an insidious [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1454.02s)]
*  We'd be it's like a sort of soft anti-semitism that people are now they just without really consciously being aware of it [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1456.86s)]
*  They've become anti-semitic. So it's [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1463.6599999999999s)]
*  It's the same thing [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1466.82s)]
*  It's it's exactly we're gonna we're gonna need to be deprogrammed but we've been so heavily programmed by the mainstream media [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1469.5s)]
*  With wall-to-wall coverage you're not getting any perspective from [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1477.1s)]
*  From the Middle East you're not getting any perspective from Iran [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1482.18s)]
*  You're not getting any perspective from that side of it [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1485.78s)]
*  No, all of the guests that you'll have on television are all pro-israel [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1488.1399999999999s)]
*  there and this is right out of that same playbook from 2002 so [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1492.42s)]
*  If you look at the data on this I find this fascinating and again [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1497.34s)]
*  This is where I'm trying not to be emotional, but I'm trying to just like look at the data after [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1500.26s)]
*  2002 [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1504.74s)]
*  And I came at this from like a personal perspective and not to talk about me [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1506.46s)]
*  But like my my brother was in the first Gulf War and he went in with the Navy SEALS [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1509.74s)]
*  Before anyone else he was in Baghdad [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1515.94s)]
*  So he was there basically directing Tomahawk missile attacks at himself, you know [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1518.18s)]
*  You could flying right over his head essentially who's in Baghdad. Yeah [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1523.26s)]
*  So we would send like care packages and things like that [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1527.74s)]
*  But of course, we were all told at the time tie a yellow ribbon around your tree [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1530.3799999999999s)]
*  You remember the the black and white images of Wolf Blitzer with a little helmet on [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1534.1799999999998s)]
*  You know talking about how great this was to you know to stop [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1540.74s)]
*  To stop Saddam Hussein, so we watched all that happen [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1546.5s)]
*  Forget how long that last it was like 11 months or something like that. I forget. Yes. Yes [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1550.1399999999999s)]
*  so then 2002 rolls around and here we go again and [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1555.1399999999999s)]
*  Now the playbook was set is your brother out by this point [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1559.74s)]
*  No, he wasn't out at this point. He was still in it. He was still in in the Navy [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1563.6599999999999s)]
*  But he didn't have to deal with this part of it [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1568.04s)]
*  So more of like a a land lover, I guess, you know at that point [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1571.02s)]
*  But then he was in Afghanistan. So he's had a long history of like having to deal with this but [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1576.6599999999999s)]
*  so I saw if you looked at the media analysis at the time like 2002 into 2003 like we're attacked on September 11th, I [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1581.58s)]
*  Maintain a massive false flag operation, but you do you you know, but I [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1590.7s)]
*  Absolutely believe it was a catalyst to get us into these forever wars [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1596.02s)]
*  Shut up. Don't ask questions about it. You'll be painted as you know, and truth or whatever. Yeah, we can't declassify those documents. Yeah, so [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1600.1000000000001s)]
*  whatever [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1608.1000000000001s)]
*  Whose country is this by the way? I was under the impression. It was partly mine. I thought it was a shareholder here born here [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1609.78s)]
*  I'm a citizen. Why don't I have the right to know I don't understand. I know someone who died on 9-eleven [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1615.9s)]
*  I spent years of my life responding to it professionally [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1621.3400000000001s)]
*  so did other members of my family and I don't have a right to see the documents because tell me tell me how that works [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1625.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, you know William Randolph Hearst made us sure that we couldn't know the truth [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1632.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean we want to go back even further into history with the media narratives being how everything is being framed [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1637.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean we look at remember the main the reason we went to war with Spain, you know [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1643.98s)]
*  I was on pages of the Hearst papers the New York Journal at the time. I think I'm an American. Yeah [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1647.7s)]
*  so [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1655.1000000000001s)]
*  the playbook was set and [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1656.3400000000001s)]
*  after after 9-eleven these networks all of the major news networks started [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1658.98s)]
*  the drumbeat for war CBS NBC [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1664.98s)]
*  ABC and PBS News they started their nightly newscasts every night [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1668.14s)]
*  Would have guests just about they were all pro-war go take out Saddam Hussein [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1672.86s)]
*  I think when they did the analysis the fair the FAIR report at the time looked at just the nightly newscasts [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1677.38s)]
*  393 of their guests out of those three of them just three of them were anti-war and [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1686.26s)]
*  Like moderately anti-war not like when like not like you or me on there [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1693.18s)]
*  Maybe we shouldn't only three of them and that was just the nightly newscasts like the shows that most people don't even watch [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1698.1s)]
*  Anyway, you know the 630 nightly newscasts [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1704.06s)]
*  the Tom Brokaw era [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1706.82s)]
*  but then then Colin Powell, you know goes before Congress and he holds up that fake anthrax vial and [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1708.98s)]
*  Pushes us to war in Iraq and says that he has mobile biological weapons labs. We can't really find them [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1718.34s)]
*  So they're mobile we got to go in there. It's a threat to the region. Of course, it's a threat to Israel [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1725.5s)]
*  the network the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1730.14s)]
*  The cable news channels then that was when they did the really exhaustive study of the cable news channels [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1731.9s)]
*  And I found this fascinating that I think was like [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1737.38s)]
*  1600 I might be off by like a few but it's like [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1740.74s)]
*  1600 guests they analyzed during that time after Colin Powell sat before Congress and [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1743.78s)]
*  Essentially lied on I think unknowingly lied [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1749.94s)]
*  That this was a threat [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1753.34s)]
*  1600 of the guests there were [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1755.82s)]
*  like 67 percent of the guests were pro-war on [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1759.06s)]
*  Across CNN MSNBC Fox News all of the networks all of the networks the Brit Hume show on Fox [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1763.78s)]
*  The the Wolf Blitzer show on CNN almost overwhelmingly all [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1773.26s)]
*  Pro war MSNBC at the time [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1778.1s)]
*  Then fired Phil Donahue [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1781.46s)]
*  Cancelled his show because he was very much in the judge Napolitano like maybe we shouldn't be going on war [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1783.94s)]
*  So MSNBC fired him cancelled his show and replaced it with a show called [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1789.42s)]
*  countdown Iraq [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1794.78s)]

*  Asking questions about this [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1803.54s)]
*  Why are we doing this? Why should we be doing this? This seems like it's a boondoggle. It's a lie [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1805.78s)]
*  Maybe we should be questioning this allowing the weapons inspectors to do this [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1810.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, and by the way at the time when all of the the networks were pushing this narrative [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1813.74s)]
*  They did a study and 61 percent of Americans [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1818.82s)]
*  supported [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1822.98s)]
*  Delaying any kind of attack let the weapons inspectors do their jobs like we don't want to go to war [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1824.6999999999998s)]
*  So six even with all of that propaganda that was being pushed by these networks [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1830.1399999999999s)]
*  61% of Americans still said no, we shouldn't involve ourselves in this which by the way [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1834.62s)]
*  I think if you looked at those numbers would be very similar to like what Trump got in this last election with like [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1838.54s)]
*  Do we support probably way higher? You probably know these numbers better than I do [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1843.1s)]
*  Like what percentage of Americans right now want us to be involved in these forever wars? Oh, and by the way [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1847.1s)]

*  Shocking right. So again by that measure who's Thomas Massey Thomas Massey is [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1887.5s)]
*  Ideological but more than that. He's like a gentleman. He's a very decent man personally [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1893.02s)]
*  He believes in self-restraint. He believes in self-reliance. He built his own off-grid house [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1897.8600000000001s)]
*  He lives in the community he's from knows everybody [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1904.02s)]
*  His rise in politics was totally organic. He didn't you know wasn't the Young Leaders program it [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=1908.26s)]

*  vehemently and President Trump just launched a [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2128.7s)]
*  Like large diatribe untrue social about him, you know calling him non, you know [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2131.5s)]
*  Not not MAGA and he's not make America great again. And Thomas Massey is the wrong target [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2136.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was the first time that I saw Trump get ratioed actually [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2142.34s)]
*  when he attacked Massey a few months ago and [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2147.42s)]
*  Just read the comments so people usually, you know, all of the MAGA people will just jump on and say, you know [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2150.98s)]
*  Whatever you say President Trump. We love you. We love you without any sort of critical [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2156.02s)]
*  Thought and then when he when he attacked Massey a number of months ago [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2160.94s)]
*  The ratio was unbelievable. I never thought I'd see it but people overwhelming were like mr. President wrong target. It's wrong target [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2165.5s)]
*  I mean you can I I understand that Trump is annoyed [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2172.86s)]
*  Understandably that Massey's like criticizing his bill [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2177.3s)]
*  Trump thinks the bill is really important and [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2179.98s)]
*  Massey's just totally against it and you can't win Massey's vote because he really means it [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2182.58s)]
*  I think this is what the president's thinking is my sense and [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2186.54s)]
*  And that annoys him because he really feels like he has to get this bill through. Okay, that's a fair debate [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2190.22s)]
*  I get it. I get both sides [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2195.58s)]
*  But to accuse him [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2197.78s)]
*  For anyone to accuse Massey of having evil motives is really dark and [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2200.18s)]
*  Says much more about the accuser than the accused. I would say I agree. Yeah [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2205.5s)]
*  So Wow, okay. We've already gotten me spun up Clayton Morris. I've been spun up all weekend [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2210.46s)]

*  Cog in the propaganda machine those years even I was like always baffled [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2327.08s)]
*  What the hell does some have to do with 9-eleven and there was this character Steve Hayes who later became a Fox News contributor [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2332.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah member who was like [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2338.44s)]
*  Who's just kind of dumb? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2340.44s)]
*  Not evil or anything is just stupid and ambitious and trying to feed his family [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2342.7599999999998s)]
*  But he wound up writing this book [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2347.64s)]
*  And I think the Cheney people like leaked him a bunch of lies and he was dumb enough to believe them [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2350.0s)]
*  And it was like a book like no actually Saddam was behind 9-eleven [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2354.54s)]
*  We work together actually I was like, ah, I don't think you really made the case there [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2362.24s)]
*  What when did he publish that book was that before Colin Powell's anthrax? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2367.3199999999997s)]
*  I you know, I can't it's all a blur to me [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2372.16s)]
*  Was a long time ago and I was right in the middle of it [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2374.96s)]
*  So it's it was hard. It's harder to see the outlines right in the middle of something [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2377.7200000000003s)]
*  I didn't have clarity and like the fair report at the time [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2380.7400000000002s)]
*  I would have been like fair is a very liberal group and I would have been like well liberals [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2383.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it gives a shit what they think. Yeah, and I'm still a very opposed to liberals, but the definition liberal has changed [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2387.8s)]
*  But now I would I would hope I would say I don't care where the information comes from [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2394.78s)]
*  What matters to me is whether or not it's true, right? You have to be focused on what's true [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2399.64s)]
*  Period like that has to be your your North Star or else you're gonna wind up participating in lies as I did [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2404.44s)]
*  Do you remember a curveball? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2411.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2413.88s)]
*  So this is a the media complicity with us [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2415.12s)]
*  I spoke to an FBI agent who told me he said, you know, we when we want to leak information [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2418.2s)]
*  You know, we push it out to the Washington Post or we push it out to [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2422.56s)]
*  Intelligence agencies want to push and leak stories or plant stories. We go to the New York Times [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2426.72s)]
*  We go to the you know, we go to the Washington Post etc. And of course it used to be you know back in the day [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2430.68s)]
*  You know, they were embedded inside of newsrooms, right? So you had them inside the CBS newsroom and all of that [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2437.58s)]
*  And now they just give them the information and then they run with it they don't question it at all so curveball [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2444.4s)]
*  This has always been fascinating to me. It's you know, Colin Powell gets up there and holds up this vial and [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2450.48s)]
*  It's been kept from him that this guy curveball was a defector from Iraq he defects to Germany and [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2455.92s)]
*  Starts talking all kinds of shit about Saddam Hussein. He's got mobile biological weapons labs mobile bio labs [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2466.96s)]
*  I remember that he's got all these things and the German authorities like [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2473.96s)]
*  This guy curveball has got a screw loose. I guess [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2479.28s)]
*  so do you remember there was a [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2482.92s)]
*  CIA [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2485.2000000000003s)]
*  European chief I think his name was like Tyler [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2486.8s)]
*  Drum heller or something like that [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2491.12s)]
*  He knew that this guy screwball was had a screw loose and he warned [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2493.8s)]
*  His counterparts in DC like don't pay attention to what this guy curveball is saying. This information is not accurate [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2500.0s)]
*  He's got an agenda. This smells bad [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2507.52s)]
*  Don't don't base anything that you're giving Colin Powell or anybody anybody else any reason to go into Iraq? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2510.44s)]
*  Don't base it on curveball [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2516.88s)]
*  DC ignores it on purpose hides it from Colin Powell [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2520.48s)]
*  so then Colin Powell goes before the American people with a little vial of fake anthrax and says mobile biological weapons labs and [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2524.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean all of the networks run with it [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2533.04s)]
*  There were people in the media who were aware that curveball was had a screw loose [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2535.94s)]
*  But it didn't matter because the narrative had been set. We ignored it [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2541.34s)]
*  So the you know DC DC offices ignored it on purpose and cordoned it off [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2545.74s)]
*  I think Colin Powell's speechwriter at the time and and head of his office said we were completely deceived [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2551.1s)]
*  Because they withheld this information and this was he's Colin Powell spent weeks at CIA headquarters [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2559.46s)]
*  Going over all of the documents not one of them that he find credible [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2565.14s)]
*  The one that he ended up using [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2569.7400000000002s)]
*  One of maybe two was the mobile biological weapons labs that all came from curveball [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2572.7400000000002s)]
*  Which was all made up and then of course in 2011 curveball comes out and says yeah [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2578.94s)]
*  I made the whole thing up because I hated Saddam and I just wanted a regime change and I knew if I planted this seed [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2582.46s)]
*  It would lead to regime change [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2586.82s)]
*  Shouldn't we have a stronger predicate to go into these countries and shouldn't the the incurious media be asking questions of these people? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2588.7400000000002s)]
*  but they go along with it because it's part of [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2596.5800000000004s)]
*  You know, I don't who's feeding them these sort of like deep state talking points that they need to carry on with this [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2599.78s)]
*  but they're to me they're an extension of [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2604.34s)]
*  The Pentagon I mean when you have like Fox News has like an office in the Pentagon [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2607.6200000000003s)]
*  And who works in that office? I think Jennifer Griffin Oh Jennifer Griffin [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2612.6200000000003s)]
*  So you have these people that are literally inside the buildings [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2616.58s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin is [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2620.7799999999997s)]
*  Even by the standards of Pentagon employees [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2623.62s)]
*  I guess she's not technically an employee the Pentagon she'll she's a show obviously for the deepest of the deep states, but she [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2626.2999999999997s)]
*  She's like a parody. She's like a parody. It's like the whole thing. She's seen this amazing tweet yesterday [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2633.42s)]
*  I guess the Secretary of Defense Pete Hicks ether or former colleague [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2639.46s)]
*  Said something about you know referring to the pilots of the b2s who dropped the the Bunker Busters [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2644.64s)]
*  In Iran says something like good work boys. I think there's something like that and Jennifer Griffin immediately comes back. It was breaking news [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2650.2s)]
*  Actually, one of the pilots was a female a woman and like so all of a sudden Fox News is like celebrating the diversity of the bomber pilots [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2657.64s)]
*  There was this meme years ago several years ago making fun of the left and it was like [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2667.16s)]
*  You know someone getting bombed in some you know [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2673.68s)]
*  Benighted country and by the US or by NATO and it was like but you know at least the pilots are gay [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2676.68s)]
*  And all of a sudden Fox is like no actually we should celebrate now because one of the b2 pilots was a woman [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2684.7599999999998s)]
*  So Roe v. Wade was overturned three years ago and people celebrated, but the battle over abortion is [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2690.96s)]
*  Not over in fact did you know that [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2697.36s)]
*  Abortions are at a 10-year high in a lot of ways [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2700.7999999999997s)]
*  It's the saddest thing that happens in this country the birth rate falls and the killing of children [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2703.3199999999997s)]
*  accelerates [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2709.48s)]
*  It's awful pre-born is fighting this trend [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2710.68s)]
*  They're expanding their life-affirming care in the darkest corners of the country to help women and save babies [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2714.08s)]
*  Now the abortion mafia don't want women to think about what they are carrying [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2719.08s)]
*  They want them to think that ending the pregnancy will solve all of their problems [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2723.6800000000003s)]
*  But that is not true 11% of women who take the abortion pill for example go on to suffer serious health [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2726.84s)]
*  Consequences and that does not include the emotional and moral consequences [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2733.0800000000004s)]
*  It's bad. It's ending a life [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2738.0800000000004s)]
*  So when you give to pre-born you are not just saving a baby you're saving a mother to pre-born has already rescued over [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2740.36s)]
*  350,000 babies there are still many many more who need help [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2747.1200000000003s)]
*  Dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby to support their cause that's pound 250 baby [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2750.54s)]
*  Go to pre-born comm slash Tucker pre-born comm slash Tucker because children are the greatest gift [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2756.1s)]
*  Period you know what's amazing if you look at well first of all her coverage of this in the media in the immediate aftermath of the bombing [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2763.2999999999997s)]
*  Was this is spectacular? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2769.98s)]

*  There was not one leak no one of the explosions [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2777.82s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin's fought in a lot of wars. She's personally courageous to put a lot on the line [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2781.6200000000003s)]
*  So many of these people are even like that Jim skewdo from CNN [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2786.78s)]
*  You know unbelievable he you know he was embedded in in Ukraine, and he's like you know we we know the this massive offensive is coming [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2790.82s)]
*  Here's this and this you know being fed information directly from the deep state you know these guys, so they're all an extension [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2798.1400000000003s)]
*  You know CNN and all these are they're all an extension of the intelligence community [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2804.3s)]
*  Being fed this information and given these stores sources, so they can never say a negative thing about them because then you cut off your sources [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2809.02s)]
*  You know Jennifer Griffin as this was all unfolding and it was clear to me [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2816.98s)]
*  That there are a lot of questions about what was actually in those nuclear sites [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2822.54s)]
*  Because a week earlier Israel had struck two of them [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2827.14s)]
*  So do you think that Iran just kind of hung out and just like got a broom out and [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2830.54s)]
*  Cleaned some stuff up and just put like the pictures back up on the wall. No they were empty and [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2834.1800000000003s)]
*  Fordo by all accounts was empty as well [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2840.42s)]
*  So what exactly did we hit and then this information was coming out almost in real time? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2843.02s)]
*  But I was watching the network news coverage, and there was no sort of walking it back [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2847.06s)]
*  there was no [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2853.62s)]
*  Sessing the truth right just lying just continuing with this. This is the greatest moment in American history [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2855.66s)]
*  Yes, Jen Griffin is a liar um [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2861.8199999999997s)]
*  But also very liberal box true Trump hater [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2865.8599999999997s)]
*  to the point where I complained about her and I really tried not to complain about other people at Fox when I work there because [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2869.22s)]
*  Like I don't like that you know office politics stuff, but she was discrediting the channel. She was such a Trump hater [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2874.1s)]
*  And it was like emotional like her internal memos, you know from the Pentagon sources are telling us [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2880.58s)]
*  We're like screeds. It was like I'll just read political playbook if that's what you know or whatever [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2887.38s)]
*  I'll read mother Jones and I said to an executive of Fox like what what are we doing with this Jennifer Griffin person? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2892.38s)]
*  She's an idiot. She doesn't tell the truth [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2900.22s)]
*  She misleads our viewers and she's like a screaming liberal who hates Trump who our viewers love so what do we get? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2902.46s)]
*  What are we getting out of this and I was like oh? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2909.9s)]
*  It's like boy you could not touch Jennifer Griffin. I don't know what that's about [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2912.82s)]
*  but um [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2918.38s)]
*  Well if you have an office in the Pentagon, maybe that's what that's about maybe I mean or I [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2919.98s)]
*  Don't know [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2926.62s)]
*  That's that whole other world that I you know [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2927.82s)]
*  I'm not a part of but I just I cannot I can't tolerate it [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2929.78s)]
*  And it's why so many people are so fed up with cable news [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2933.3s)]
*  But you have to understand well you understand it [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2938.06s)]
*  Maybe your viewers don't fully understand or appreciate how profitable [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2941.2599999999998s)]
*  It is for these networks during war [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2946.62s)]
*  so if you look at the numbers from like [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2950.46s)]
*  like q1 of [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2953.14s)]
*  20 or 2002 [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2955.14s)]
*  2002 before we went into Iraq the numbers for revenue for for Fox [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2958.06s)]
*  was [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2964.7799999999997s)]
*  About 70 or so [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2965.98s)]
*  I forget the numbers exactly, but anyway in that following quarter when the war started in March [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2968.58s)]
*  The numbers went up a hundred and fifty percent no way hundred and fifty percent so war is incredibly profitable [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2974.54s)]
*  I mean CNN was built on it right [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2981.3s)]
*  I mean CNN's were literally started or was brought to public attention during the war that your brother served in in 1990 [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2983.34s)]
*  So they made you know billions off of war [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2989.98s)]
*  So count down to Iraq showdown with Saddam like all of the sort of build up to war [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=2994.42s)]
*  People gonna tune in they're gonna make money from ad revenue when in an era where ad revenue is plummeting the [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3000.06s)]
*  Young people don't watch cable news [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3007.78s)]
*  They get their news from like tik-tok and an X and little sound bites here and they YouTube and places like that [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3010.34s)]
*  They're not buying a cable subscription. Do you know any young people that have a cable? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3016.66s)]
*  If you asked any of your staff do any of you guys own a cable subscription so you can watch [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3020.74s)]
*  CNN or Fox News no so that audience is you know like getting much much older [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3026.62s)]
*  So it's gonna be very interesting to see what happens to like the cable news landscape in the next few years remember Benghazi [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3033.54s)]
*  Right. I'm glad you brought that up [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3040.3799999999997s)]
*  For a whole host of reasons, but go ahead. I don't mean to well [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3043.62s)]
*  That was kind of in progress when I got to Fox I've been fired from a couple other channels Roger Ailes hired me [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3047.82s)]
*  so nice of him never stop being grateful and [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3052.86s)]
*  but I show up in this Benghazi thing is like [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3056.94s)]
*  Going bonkers and Benghazi Benghazi Benghazi and this is like the touchstone to this is the Rosetta stone to [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3060.5800000000004s)]
*  the Obama administration where I take him down with Benghazi and of course the US ambassador was killed and [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3067.54s)]
*  So whatever I mean, that's I'm totally opposed to you. My father was US ambassador [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3072.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm against US ambassadors being killed right through the streets. Yeah. Yeah completely [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3076.2599999999998s)]
*  So I was on board and we talked about it a lot on TV and I remember one day [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3080.1s)]
*  I was thinking I saw some number of the number of CIA operations got CIA officers who were there and [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3085.66s)]
*  Benghazi is like an ancient city. I think it's a custom site versus on on the med and [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3091.3799999999997s)]
*  You know second city of Libya. It's a real place, but we had we had so many CIA personnel in Benghazi, Libya [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3096.02s)]
*  and I remember this was after we [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3102.68s)]
*  killed [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3106.7799999999997s)]
*  Gaddafi and I was like why what what were they doing there? What was people doing there? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3108.62s)]
*  So I asked that question on TV. You know, it turns out they were there [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3114.66s)]
*  helping to move [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3118.9399999999996s)]
*  Gaddafi's arm stockpiles [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3120.4599999999996s)]
*  to fund [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3122.4599999999996s)]
*  The war in Syria which we were not prosecuting on our own behalf. It was a hundred percent for a foreign country [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3124.54s)]
*  We were doing this we had no national interest in stoking a civil war in in Syria [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3130.74s)]
*  We did that really at the behest of another country [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3135.58s)]
*  Shamefully killed all these people but whatever anyway, I didn't know any of this but I was just I asked like one day [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3138.34s)]
*  Why do we have so many CIA officers? I sort of understood that world a little bit. I was like, that's weird [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3143.18s)]
*  Do we have 35 operations guys in Benghazi Libya? Like what is or whatever the number was? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3147.86s)]
*  Whoa, I got immediately. Oh, whoa. That's not the Benghazi story. We're looking at [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3153.5s)]
*  Really Fox told you that 100% [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3159.86s)]
*  Like I don't know like what does that have to do with it the point is a US ambassador was killed that's bad [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3162.02s)]
*  Let's just keep it there. Like we don't that's not our area. I'm glad you bring this up [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3167.42s)]
*  Something big is going on here [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3172.9s)]
*  Because you know Fox hated Obama, of course. Yeah. Yeah me too. So yeah vehemently [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3175.38s)]
*  hated Hillary Clinton me too vehemently so [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3182.2200000000003s)]
*  They're responsible for the Benghazi disaster killing of US ambassador [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3186.46s)]
*  But you couldn't ask questions about like why the hell we in Libya to begin with exactly. So it's not amazing [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3192.38s)]
*  So you because that speaks to the heart of it, which is the uniparty right that speaks to the heart of it [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3197.94s)]
*  Which is both that liberals? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3204.26s)]
*  Neo cons they're all operating from the same playbook. Exactly. So you can't question like why are we in Libya in the first place? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3206.7400000000002s)]
*  Why why did we go in and you know, just because you know, Kaddafi wanted to make his own country prosperous [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3213.02s)]
*  That we can't have that in the Middle East [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3221.3799999999997s)]
*  In the same way that we couldn't have Iran nationalizing their own oil in the 1950s, right? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3223.58s)]
*  That's the same thing [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3229.02s)]
*  So you can't ask that question [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3230.2599999999998s)]
*  And so it just speaks to the military industrial complex control the uniparty that operates in Washington DC [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3231.74s)]
*  That fully is an operational at the at the media networks as well [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3238.4199999999996s)]
*  Don't question why we're in Libya just focus on the Hillary Clinton piece of what happened in Benghazi [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3242.9399999999996s)]
*  Don't question what's going on in Syria just you know focus on Assad as a madman and he's gonna kill he's gassed all these people [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3248.22s)]
*  Which was fake [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3254.62s)]
*  It was fake. I said it was fake boy. They wanted to kill me for saying that I [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3256.62s)]
*  Mean this sort of predicate these propaganda pieces that they use [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3260.94s)]
*  It becomes part of like, you know this national vernacular on television, you know Saddam's get you know [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3264.98s)]
*  Assad is gassing his own people [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3271.7s)]
*  It's not true [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3274.5s)]
*  It's not true they were so emotionally so that by that point I [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3276.18s)]
*  neutral on us not always have been but [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3281.8999999999996s)]
*  There was a thriving Christian community there. I am a Christian. So I felt legitimate for me to ask like how does it affect the Christians? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3284.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. No one else is saying it. So I thought I would yeah, and I said that Wow people didn't like that [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3290.8399999999997s)]
*  And then the gas attack came which was of course the justification for a bombing campaign another bombing campaign in Syria [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3296.7799999999997s)]
*  Someone high-level person tipped me off. Hey, this is not real. Well, there's no evidence. It's real if it's real show me how it's real [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3304.58s)]
*  Yeah, in fact, it's been not only no evidence. It's been debunked, right? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3310.14s)]
*  But this was like the day after the day of yeah, so I said that on TV boy [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3313.06s)]
*  I got taken aside by a senior person there who I really liked had known my whole life honestly [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3316.8599999999997s)]
*  And I was like Tucker. I don't know what you're doing here, but this is this is and I was like in very emotional [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3322.3399999999997s)]
*  Like why are you defending Assad? It was like I'm not defending Assad [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3328.2999999999997s)]
*  We're using the US military to kill people and I just want to know [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3332.2400000000002s)]
*  If the justification for that is real and they haven't shown that it is and they're clearly lying and I don't know much about [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3336.04s)]
*  Anything, but I do know lying when I see I have a good [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3341.16s)]
*  Instinct for that and I think they're lying. Wow. I got scolded [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3344.4s)]
*  By somebody who I really liked and was close to personally but was like emotional like how dare you? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3348.92s)]
*  What is that? I don't I never have I don't understand it to this day. I [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3354.4s)]
*  Think I understand it in a if you look at it with this like broader brush that were [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3357.84s)]
*  We can't have dissent when you're trying to when you're trying to do the bidding of a foreign country [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3364.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean Israel absolutely wanted us to take out Assad. They've been wanting for the same thing with Libya [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3367.8s)]
*  And if you go back to Netanyahu sitting there in front of Congress telling us about Iraq that Saddam Hussein [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3374.1200000000003s)]
*  100% has weapons of mass destruction 100% there's no doubt in my mind [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3380.56s)]
*  You need to go in there like it you know, by the way, it's a risk to America [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3384.36s)]
*  So this is always the the you know, the story which is it's a risk to America if if you don't go and bomb Iran [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3387.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a risk to America [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3394.6000000000004s)]
*  We're defending freedom together and the same with Syria that Syria is gonna launch attacks [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3395.56s)]
*  Which by the way, Syria was one of the most peaceful countries in the world [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3400.44s)]
*  Yeah, Damascus a beautiful country a beautiful city [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3403.88s)]
*  One of the most peaceful countries in the world looking at Syria [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3408.0800000000004s)]
*  Beautiful city one of the most peaceful countries in the world look it up [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3410.8399999999997s)]
*  but when you want to [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3415.72s)]
*  Take care of your own people and you want to sort of de-western eyes [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3417.9199999999996s)]
*  That's a that's a huge threat in the same way that Iran wanting to nationalize its own oil and kick British petroleum out of its country [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3421.96s)]
*  We're gonna keep our own oil. I mean look what I did to Norway in the late 70s [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3429.2799999999997s)]
*  Norway became one of the richest and wealthiest countries in the world number one per capita [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3433.8799999999997s)]
*  So if there's a history lesson here like Iran was basically trying to do what Norway did in the late 70s [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3438.3199999999997s)]
*  We're gonna not you know nationalize our own oil, but keep keep the profitability for ourselves [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3444.24s)]
*  And then what happened the United States took it over? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3450.08s)]
*  But British petroleum came back in we installed the Shah they end up using all of this oil funneling off to other places [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3452.72s)]
*  So doesn't enrich the Iranians at all [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3458.52s)]
*  widespread poverty, it's like something out of Mao's playbook, you know, like [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3461.96s)]
*  Take all of your food and then just ship it off to Russia [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3465.4399999999996s)]

*  Really high taxes give them no food produce a bountiful amount of food just like Iran with oil [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3472.3999999999996s)]
*  But instead of keeping it [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3478.72s)]
*  Send it to Stalin so that you're in you're fattening them up the wheat goes to the wheat goes to Russia [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3480.7599999999998s)]
*  It doesn't go to the Chinese people. It's a plate, you know, it's right out of that playbook [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3486.8799999999997s)]
*  So we cannot have a strong Libya [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3490.3599999999997s)]
*  That [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3493.2s)]
*  It you know serves its own self interests [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3494.64s)]
*  We cannot have a strong Iran that wants to enrich its own people [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3497.3199999999997s)]
*  Have you ever seen the photos of like Iran in the 1950s? I have it's unbelievable people should look it up. I mean [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3501.04s)]
*  Girls in miniskirts walking you'd be hard-pressed to tell like the difference between like downtown Rochester, New York [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3508.16s)]
*  These black and white photos was also thriving. Yeah in 1954. Yeah [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3514.4399999999996s)]
*  Sad no, it's and I don't know I [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3519.92s)]
*  I've [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3523.64s)]
*  managed to [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3524.92s)]
*  See the Israeli perspective on I don't see it on Gaza. I'm just gonna say that but on most things I've [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3526.24s)]
*  managed to see the Israeli perspective and [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3532.52s)]
*  You know, they think they're acting in their own interests and my kind of gut level view is that every country acts in its own interest [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3535.4s)]
*  Every person acts in his family's interest that that makes sense to me [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3542.0s)]
*  I've never been mad about it [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3546.08s)]
*  Again Gaza, I think is [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3549.08s)]
*  Is too much. It's my personal opinion. I'm sorry. They call me a hater [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3551.12s)]
*  But but whatever but in just in general like countries act in our interests like that's okay. I don't understand the Americans [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3556.4s)]
*  Who were bought in on that? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3563.6s)]
*  Or change their profiles so that they've got their Christian Americans and they've got an Israeli flag [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3565.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't get that. I don't understand get that everyone's like, oh you hate Israel. No [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3570.7599999999998s)]
*  My my real rage is reserved for people who sell it their own country [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3575.12s)]
*  Yeah, like I get their perspective they think they're doing what they need to do. They could be right or wrong [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3579.08s)]
*  We can debate it whether what they're doing is good for them [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3582.72s)]
*  I you know doesn't seem like it but maybe they're you know, what do I know? No, I think Israel I mean [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3584.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll say it I think Israel is killing themselves. Yeah, okay, but that's their country, right? I don't understand [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3589.12s)]
*  Why the selling out of my country where I'm from by my countrymen like that really offends me? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3595.04s)]
*  That's fair, isn't it? Right because I don't hear Israelis wanting to pump us with billions of dollars [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3602.36s)]
*  Telling us that you know, you guys have a fentanyl problem [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3608.7599999999998s)]
*  Like you know or coming into our country like the IDF is gonna protect our southern borders to protect us [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3611.56s)]
*  Yeah, we why are we sending billions of dollars? What? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3616.7999999999997s)]
*  Israel has a surplus a budget surplus and a space force [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3621.2s)]
*  Like space program like why are we I mean just driving down streets seeing like homeless people [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3627.08s)]
*  Oh, I know I was driving down the street just the other day just this guy like with a bag just like, you know [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3632.68s)]
*  Falling out of the trees [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3636.48s)]
*  Was in California a few weeks ago and just the tents and I couldn't believe the amount of 10 cities underneath [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3638.28s)]
*  It's a national emergency. It's the most pressing national emergency [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3644.84s)]
*  I can imagine if your countrymen are dying of drug odys by the hundreds of thousands and living on the street by the millions [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3647.6800000000003s)]
*  Which they are. Yeah, how is that? Not the most important thing that's happening in your country, but they'll say it's a false dichotomy [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3654.2000000000003s)]
*  How what is us sending billions to Israel have to do with all the homeless people? No, I mean, that's it's silly [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3659.52s)]
*  How much disk space how much attention of our leaders is focused abroad versus how much is focused here? It's it's simple [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3665.72s)]
*  It's not even about the money though [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3673.06s)]
*  It is on some level but the money but it's what the attention if I'm totally absorbed in the problems of my neighbors children [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3674.3799999999997s)]
*  It leaves less time from the problems of my own children. It's that simple [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3680.64s)]
*  Well Ted Cruz said to you in your interview with him the very first thing out of his mouth [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3683.72s)]
*  The very first reason he wanted to become a part of the United States Congress is because he wanted to see how he could serve [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3687.04s)]
*  Israel I think those were his [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3692.66s)]
*  Maybe the problem with that is once you start saying that stuff out loud [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3694.66s)]
*  I [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3698.7s)]
*  Mean, I you know, it's not good [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3699.98s)]
*  People are you know, once you see how things actually operate [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3702.22s)]
*  It radicalizes people and as a true temperamental moderate [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3705.58s)]
*  Let me say I don't want that. I don't want a country full of angry people, you know what I mean? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3709.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but people like Ted Cruz who is just sort of admits that the US is not his main interest in life [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3715.3799999999997s)]
*  But he is a United States senator representing one of our biggest states [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3722.94s)]
*  That radicalizes people I mean why wouldn't it? Yeah, and I just don't want that [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3727.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't want everyone to be kind of happy and I want people to be pissed off and [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3731.8599999999997s)]
*  Writing crazy shit on X and which they're now doing. You know what I mean? Yeah all of it anyway [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3735.7s)]
*  So can I you said you saw Fox News? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3742.4199999999996s)]
*  Recently, you're not a huge Fox. Will you lived out of the country for years? Yeah, yes, it's been ever. I never watch it for years [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3745.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but now you're back in the United States and you saw it. Can I just play we just put together a montage [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3751.18s)]
*  Which I think is fair [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3756.94s)]
*  By the way Fox canned me over two years ago. I've never attacked Fox. I'm not mad at Fox [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3758.62s)]
*  I've always liked Fox and grateful to them. This is really the first time I've attacked them, but I think it really matters [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3763.3799999999997s)]
*  I think this is a fair representation of what's on Fox [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3768.98s)]
*  Fox's air right now. Okay, here it is [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3773.46s)]
*  The greater risk would be to do nothing in the face of a clear and present danger the world cannot experience another [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3775.66s)]
*  Holocaust if Iran gets a nuclear weapon [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3783.54s)]
*  I think the odds are unacceptably high that we would find out with a mushroom cloud over New York City or Los Angeles [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3786.8599999999997s)]
*  Or Tel Aviv and Israel Israel is doing an enormous favor to the United States right now [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3793.58s)]
*  Nuclear Iran is not just an existential threat to Israel. It is an existential threat to America [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3799.42s)]
*  Take these enemies not just figuratively not just seriously [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3805.66s)]
*  But literally when they say they want a second genocide [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3810.7799999999997s)]
*  They want a nuclear Holocaust [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3814.74s)]
*  They mean it if we need to provide bombs to Israel provide bombs if we need to fly planes with Israel do joint operations [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3816.2999999999997s)]
*  But here's the bigger question wouldn't the world be better off if the ayatollahs went away and replaced by something better? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3823.54s)]
*  Wouldn't Iran be better off America first is not sitting in a beach chair and using words [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3830.22s)]
*  It's taking decisive action when we can take out four dough the one swoop of an airplane. What the hell is it gonna take? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3834.9s)]
*  To realize what we're up against here [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3843.22s)]
*  This country should be united united in its own defense [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3846.7s)]
*  Nobody's dragging us into anything. It's not the Jews. It's not Israel again [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3851.7s)]
*  No [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3856.58s)]
*  Long-range [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3858.9s)]
*  Intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads are for you and me and your children and your grandchildren [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3861.18s)]
*  That's what's airing on Fox by the way that same [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3869.22s)]
*  Person Mark Levin who was a totally minor player in Fox world up until recently. I can tell you firsthand [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3873.14s)]
*  Suggested today that we send nuclear weapons to Ukraine, too [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3881.74s)]
*  And [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3884.72s)]
*  But I should just make it clear in the last clip that we played he said [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3886.64s)]
*  Intercontinental ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads are meant for you. They're gonna kill you the mullahs [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3891.04s)]
*  Ron doesn't have [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3897.48s)]
*  Intercontinental ballistic missiles. It doesn't have nuclear warheads like all of this is [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3899.04s)]
*  It's it's deranged and the point is to scare [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3903.56s)]
*  old people into [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3907.7599999999998s)]
*  Obedience and let me say one last thing that everyone on that list so we've got Hannity Cruz Barry Weiss Lindsey Graham [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3910.44s)]
*  Kaylee McEnany Mark Levin [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3917.6000000000004s)]
*  Levin [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3919.92s)]
*  of those people [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3921.92s)]
*  Hannity's I think a genuine friend of Trump's I think Hannity really likes Trump and I just want to say again [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3924.5600000000004s)]
*  I really like Sean Hannity personally got no problem Sean Hannity at all personally and he he likes [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3929.5200000000004s)]
*  He likes Trump I don't know Kaylee McEnany what she thinks of Trump but Ted Cruz Barry Weiss Lindsey Graham and Mark Levin [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3935.66s)]
*  Hate Donald Trump. They're all never Trumpers. Well, I mean [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3943.1s)]
*  You know one of them Ted Cruz ran against him, right? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3948.34s)]
*  So like right these are people who hate Donald Trump. I'm not guessing there. No, I know them all [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3951.02s)]
*  They're like Nikki Haley supporters a hundred percent, right Ron DeSantis [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3957.62s)]
*  And they're all now saying how much they love Trump like anyway, I'm gonna stand back and just let you assess like what we just saw [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3961.9s)]
*  Well, one thing I noticed I didn't see any dissenting voices at all again goes right back to the 2002 playbook [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3969.22s)]
*  I didn't see anybody saying wait a second [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3976.34s)]
*  Challenging Mark Levin about intercontinental ballistic missiles. There was no [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3979.66s)]
*  Questioning of that there's just there's no one there to question it [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3985.54s)]
*  There was a guy who would have questioned him but they fired him a couple years ago [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3988.66s)]
*  And now he's got a much bigger platform [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3992.54s)]
*  Sound self-pitying but it is no it's true. Like is Hannity. I mean, I think Ted Cruz [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3995.54s)]
*  I don't know whose show he was on during that but his Hannity gonna question [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=3999.66s)]
*  Like I saw Mark Levin go on a tirade the other day on Hannity show and then Hannity basically jumped in and [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4003.14s)]
*  supported that tirade [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4010.18s)]
*  praising Trump as maybe you know that [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4012.14s)]
*  Decades of presidents had the opportunity to attack and didn't do it. It took Donald Trump like [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4015.18s)]
*  You know God basically to to attack and destroy Iran's nuclear facilities [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4020.58s)]
*  but I didn't see any dissenting voices on this at all and the idea of Barry Weiss saying that [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4026.54s)]
*  That this is a threat to America. So that's that's what we keep hearing [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4032.66s)]
*  This is a threat to very wise to say whatever she needs to say Barry Weiss's interest is not the United States at all [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4035.8999999999996s)]
*  It's odd. I mean [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4041.8999999999996s)]
*  But factually is it a threat to America? That's what I want to know like who and if it is certainly make it a threat to America [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4044.02s)]
*  right, and that's the that's the beauty of [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4050.86s)]
*  Now we're hearing about now their sleeper cells [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4053.7000000000003s)]
*  So I spoke to a CIA agent former CIA agent a couple months ago and he said my biggest fear is [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4055.9s)]
*  That they will use [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4064.38s)]
*  He said this is this is the CIA plan. This is what we do. So we use a dumb Muslim [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4066.7400000000002s)]
*  We'll get a dumb Muslim who's easily brainwashable and we'll have them carry out an attack as a catalyst for us to go into war [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4071.86s)]
*  Go into war in Iran and then oh this guy's Iran. This guy's an Iranian. Ah, there you go [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4079.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm Palestinian Christian like sir, huh, sir, huh? Just throw them. Yeah [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4085.18s)]
*  Right exactly. So we will use a Patsy and that will be the catalyst [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4089.86s)]
*  Do you see what they did in you know in Wayne, Michigan? Did you see what they did? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4093.88s)]
*  There was a there was a you know carrying out this attack by the way these accounts as soon as we attacked [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4098.28s)]
*  the nuclear sites almost immediately there were [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4103.8s)]
*  videos being surfaced and flooded on social media about like [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4106.84s)]
*  Islamists running towards subways in New York City. So reckless and dangerous. It's so [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4111.24s)]
*  Immoral but so profitable Tucker [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4117.64s)]
*  So much money they'll make off of this. I mean, I think Mark Levin and Barry Weiss, you know, whatever [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4120.32s)]
*  I mean, these are people who just really just don't care at all [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4126.74s)]
*  Okay, but there are other people here Lindsey Graham who everyone hates Lindsey Graham, but I always say this and I mean it [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4130.5s)]
*  What's absolutely delightful person delightful person hilarious nice [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4136.38s)]
*  Like he's not in person. He's not some kind of monster at all. He's like fun guy to have dinner with which I have done [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4141.62s)]
*  What's he thinking? Does part of him think geez a lot of people could die like I'm [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4147.62s)]
*  Like when they die do I feel bad about it it's an unpatriotic question Tucker, but like this is so [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4153.22s)]
*  That's an anti-semitic question. Like how can you think really thinks that I? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4158.9s)]
*  Don't think he's I think he's so bought and paid for by the military industrial complex [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4164.82s)]
*  How much money he's made from the military industrial complex people are dying. I don't think they care at all [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4169.82s)]
*  They're in a bubble man. I don't think they care at all and so they don't think at some point [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4174.86s)]
*  To answer for this [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4179.72s)]
*  Maybe in the afterlife they will but because it always happens over there. We don't live that long like human life spans pretty short [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4181.240000000001s)]
*  I don't know. You're really rolling the dice with this kind of stuff. I mean, maybe there's no God and [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4187.56s)]
*  You know, it's fine and like the guy who dies richest wins [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4193.0s)]
*  I guess maybe but what if you're what if you know, the blaze Pascal formula is like right like why would you [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4195.76s)]
*  Why would you risk that? He's only risking like purgatory for a few thousand years and then he'll you know [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4203.320000000001s)]
*  Off one way or the other [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4209.52s)]
*  But it's incredibly like if somebody sent you ten million dollars to say that, you know [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4211.56s)]
*  Firestone tires are better than Bridgestone tires assuming they're not the same company, which I think they may be but whatever [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4217.72s)]
*  But if someone sent you ten million dollars or a hundred million dollars or ten billion dollars to [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4226.64s)]
*  Say something was untrue that you knew would get people killed [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4230.88s)]
*  You want ten billion dollars, but you'd be like, I don't know. I can't that's not a good idea [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4234.4800000000005s)]
*  kind of rolling with [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4239.26s)]
*  like my soul here, but these people are soulless and [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4240.98s)]
*  They're not going to ask these tough questions. They're not going to challenge this as you and I talked about last night [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4244.74s)]
*  I'm thinking of that Upton Sinclair quote where he said what you it's [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4249.139999999999s)]
*  it's [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4252.54s)]
*  It's hard to convince a man of something. He's paid not to see yeah [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4253.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's a you know [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4256.66s)]
*  If you're paying if you're on the salary if he's being paid to not see it [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4258.139999999999s)]
*  So if your whole salary relies on knowing something [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4262.099999999999s)]
*  You know [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4266.099999999999s)]
*  Our not knowing something [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4267.22s)]
*  You know, it's difficult. So all these you know different anchors on these different television [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4269.78s)]
*  they want the prestige of being on TV and having people like put makeup on them and all of that and they [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4273.38s)]
*  They rely on that contract [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4278.54s)]
*  They rely on that salary and then if they don't have that they go off and try to do things like what like Don Lemon did [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4280.3s)]
*  Or whatever and if you're part of that machine, no one wants to watch your stuff [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4286.139999999999s)]
*  You know because well you for for ten years you were a liar [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4289.94s)]
*  So now you're gonna go off and do an independent show and now and now we're gonna watch you and trust you like you were [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4294.58s)]
*  Lying for money for so many years right pushing a narrative and now you're gonna go off. We're not gonna watch it [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4299.9400000000005s)]
*  so I [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4307.22s)]
*  Just find it so [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4308.66s)]
*  No, it's such a good point [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4310.9800000000005s)]
*  It's the same argument that they used in 2002 that it's an existential threat to the United States of America that Saddam Hussein is going [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4312.62s)]
*  to use [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4320.22s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic missiles he's gonna [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4321.54s)]
*  Gather a warhead with anthrax. He's gonna shoot, you know, he's gonna shoot it into some mall somewhere [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4323.9s)]
*  So that's the fear right there gonna they're playing on our fear that we are going to be attacked by Iran [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4329.18s)]
*  And we they don't have an intercontinental ballistic missile to hit us to forget just don't let the facts get in the way [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4335.5s)]
*  They actually don't have a nuclear warhead [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4341.68s)]
*  They don't have the reentry mechanism to even make that happen [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4344.78s)]
*  But we need to be fearful of it. Like I don't wake up fearful of Iran in the morning. Maybe I'm dumb [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4348.26s)]
*  You know, maybe I'm an idiot and I should that should be the first thing that I do when I wake up in the morning [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4353.0599999999995s)]
*  Not like the trend day or Agua [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4357.099999999999s)]
*  Gang down the street. I should be more worried about [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4359.54s)]
*  Iran is going to attack me and by the way, why would they attack us? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4362.98s)]
*  I know but why why aren't they attacking Sweden right now if they hate our freedoms? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4366.099999999999s)]
*  Why aren't they attacking Norway right now? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4371.58s)]
*  Why would they attack us if we get that if we get the hell out of there? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4374.9s)]
*  Maybe we wouldn't maybe we wouldn't have these problems if we wouldn't build these bases in their backyard [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4379.14s)]
*  if we wouldn't meddle in trying to [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4384.66s)]
*  Decapitate their leadership and overthrow and install a pro-western government and tell them to open McDonald's [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4387.22s)]
*  But we can't we seem like we're so addicted to doing it and we thought under Trump that this would be a realignment [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4394.34s)]
*  Oh, we're not going to do this [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4400.42s)]
*  well, the whole the whole game has been to manipulate the president, of course and [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4402.62s)]
*  You know, I think that's true with any president, I mean, it's that's the seat of power [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4407.42s)]
*  So, of course a lot of people are interested in you know, moving in their direction. I get it, you know, it's all it's not surprising [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4411.1s)]
*  It's not even offensive. It's just the way things are [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4417.06s)]
*  I'm just offended [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4419.7s)]
*  Watching these people who I know personally and I know for a fact they hate Trump the Murdochs really hate Trump [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4421.62s)]

*  This channel run and staffed by Trump haters, they're not all Trump haters again [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4549.02s)]
*  I Sean Hannity likes Trump good for him [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4553.900000000001s)]
*  For real he does and there are a few other people there who like Trump, but most people hate them [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4556.46s)]
*  They wouldn't allow Trump on my show [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4562.22s)]
*  Period like Trump would call in what they call a beeper or a phone er, you know [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4564.5s)]
*  I mean we had him on our show all the time. Yeah, I'm calling like no not doing that [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4569.1s)]
*  I did an interview in April of 2023 right with Trump at Mar-a-Lago [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4573.42s)]
*  Right before I got canned like a week before I got canned and boy [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4577.62s)]
*  They were furious that I talked to Trump and then interview because they didn't want they didn't want to be promoted [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4581.58s)]
*  And I don't know that it's personal. They just dislike his views. They they dislike his views on economics [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4587.7s)]
*  They dislike his views on foreign policy and they're very serious about it. So [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4593.46s)]
*  Again, that's fine. You can disagree you're allowed to I believe in disagreement [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4597.9s)]
*  sincere disagreement [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4603.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm just blown away the those same people like no, no, we're we're here with MAGA [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4604.46s)]
*  We're policing MAGA. You're not MAGA says Mark Levin or whatever his great name is [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4610.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like are you serious and they were supporting DeSantis? I mean they were up until the primary hates Trump [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4617.54s)]
*  So like which is again, that's fine. I'm not attacking him [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4623.34s)]
*  I believe that everyone is allowed to come to his own conclusions about everything because I believe that people have souls [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4627.18s)]
*  They're not slaves or animals or machines [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4633.78s)]
*  They are autonomous beings created by God and so they're allowed and have to be allowed to come to their own conclusions and all [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4637.0599999999995s)]
*  Conclusions are legal. I'm not the one who's trying to criminalize opinions as they have done in Europe and they're trying to do here [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4643.34s)]
*  I reject that but Mark Levin is on the other side Levin and [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4648.58s)]
*  But for him to be like, oh, I just love Trump and Trump's the man if you're a true paper [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4653.78s)]
*  No, you're a Trump hater and so are your bosses and so are your colleagues and Jen Griffin you're a Trump hater [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4658.94s)]
*  It just drives me bonkers because it's a lie. It's fake. That's the part that bothers me. I have much more respect [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4665.219999999999s)]
*  For I don't know just some sincere left. He was like, yeah, I don't like Trump now. I didn't like him then I disagree [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4673.66s)]
*  like that just seems straightforward and [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4679.179999999999s)]
*  Sort of manly to me. This just seems totally creepy like Ted Cruz like I love Trump [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4683.099999999999s)]
*  And sycophantic totally. Yeah, that it's always yeah, it's always that's always bothered me. You know the sycophantic [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4688.94s)]
*  Kid, you know ass kissing on the air, but then the other part of it is that you know that Trump watches Fox all day [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4697.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4703.82s)]
*  Well, they know that that's why they're doing they know that [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4705.66s)]
*  So when they start an hour of a broadcast and say Trump just carried out the most magnificent [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4708.339999999999s)]
*  Attack in American history on nuclear sites Trump sitting there watching it. Oh, yeah, I did that [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4714.38s)]
*  So it's like feeding this ego [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4720.34s)]
*  It's like a weird loop. I don't understand it. Yeah, I know [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4723.14s)]
*  It's gonna be very interesting when these I mean I do understand it. It's like it's the same reason people check their Twitter [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4726.82s)]
*  Mentions or whatever they call it or a Google themselves something I've ever done. But um, yeah, I don't I don't approve of it [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4734.86s)]
*  I think it's bad. I think it makes you more insecure when you look to other people for approval people [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4741.04s)]
*  You don't know who cares what people you don't know think of you like it's so weird to me [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4745.5199999999995s)]
*  But anyway, but I think you know, it's a super tough call right now [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4748.96s)]
*  He's under the president's under enormous pressure from outside the White House [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4754.04s)]
*  from donors and [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4759.24s)]
*  Etc and I think it's natural for people to seek affirmation [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4762.0s)]
*  The problem is that you don't you know, you don't want to be [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4766.92s)]
*  Unduly influenced by flattery. I think that's a just for all of us [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4771.08s)]
*  That's a weakness that all of us have and I think you need to approach flatterers with hostility [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4774.76s)]
*  I agree flattery is way more dangerous than [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4780.4s)]
*  Criticism. Yeah, and people often ignore the flattery part and just soak it in [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4784.88s)]
*  So it's very easy to get like a thousand comments that are praising you. I love you Tucker [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4789.5199999999995s)]
*  You're me and then there's like one negative really goes after you calls you whatever and you can dwell on that and Luke lose [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4793.8s)]
*  Sleep over that. Oh, yeah, but maybe the more insidious and more dangerous or the thousand love of commerce [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4801.04s)]
*  Because you know, of course there's a kind of I mean again [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4807.64s)]
*  There's false [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4811.44s)]
*  Criticism you work for Qatar, right? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4814.44s)]
*  But like there's also legitimate criticism, which I think is really important to hear [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4817.96s)]
*  And I seek it always I try to I want to anyway [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4823.04s)]
*  But flattery is the most deceptive of all it's the most insidious the most dangerous [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4827.2s)]
*  It's it shows the least respect to you. So many flatters use no respect for you at all [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4832.72s)]
*  if you were gonna try to bring the conversation back to [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4837.88s)]
*  Like a non emotional level with what's going on there. Yeah, where would you go? What is America doing? It's really simple [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4841.28s)]
*  How's America doing countries defined by its cities go to our ten biggest cities walk around spend a day in each [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4847.4800000000005s)]
*  How's it? How's it going? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4853.12s)]
*  Doing a good job early is doing a pretty good job [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4854.84s)]
*  That's a fucking disaster [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4857.28s)]
*  It is and I live in, you know rural pockets that are great because they're more like the country was in the 80s [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4860.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not the country the country is that cities right any country? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4866.24s)]
*  I mean, in fact, there weren't even countries until fairly recently there were cities [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4870.54s)]
*  I mean that's Rome was a city. We controlled the world right the idea of a nation state is a pretty new [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4875.3s)]
*  Concept no cities matter they really matter I hate them. I don't go to them because they're terrible, right [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4881.86s)]
*  So I would just say the pressing problem in America is the condition of its cities because that is America [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4887.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not Iran with an intercontinental ballistic missile coming. Oh, it's not Iran [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4892.62s)]
*  It's also not Malibu or Jackson Hole or the weird little pockets where I live. It's not [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4896.54s)]
*  It's New York, Chicago LA [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4901.339999999999s)]
*  It is it's Atlanta. It's Minneapolis. It's have you seen Sunset Boulevard recently? No [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4903.86s)]
*  I just did an interview with [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4909.86s)]
*  someone who grew up in Hollywood and [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4912.58s)]
*  You know Hollywood's collapsing but Sunset Boulevard all the big stores are closed [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4914.94s)]
*  Oh seen seen actual these Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Yeah. Yeah, not like the East West artery that defines the city [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4919.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Oh, I know it very well. It's like all these classic stores 80 year old restaurants closed up in Hollywood [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4925.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, so when Frank says like yeah that whole area. No, I know that area really well [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4933.139999999999s)]
*  I [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4938.22s)]
*  grew up [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4939.3s)]
*  For a time in my childhood right there and I and I love it San Francisco go to Union Square. I [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4940.42s)]
*  Went there with my great-grandmother who was survived the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco went to Gump's with her as a child over Christmas [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4946.780000000001s)]
*  I'll never forget how charming Union Square was and I was born there and I was I was there this spring and I was like [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4954.18s)]
*  Coming down off and I was staying in Nob Hill come down [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4960.3s)]
*  Union Square and I was just like my heart broke. Yeah, so that's that's the problem [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4962.780000000001s)]
*  It's really simple and you mentioned to someone like Ted Cruz or I mean Mark Levin and Barry Weiss are like what? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4967.66s)]
*  But they don't care. Yeah, they have no interest in America at all [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4974.86s)]
*  But but but some of these people I mean certainly Lindsey Graham. He should care he doesn't but again [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4978.58s)]
*  It's Upton Sinclair, right? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4985.86s)]
*  If you're it's very difficult to get someone to understand something or care if their entire salary depends on them not caring [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4987.22s)]
*  So his entire salary the money that he makes from all of these lobbying groups all the military industrial complex [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=4993.66s)]
*  funds his [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5000.7s)]
*  mania his [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5002.9s)]
*  wanting to [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5004.82s)]
*  You know decapitate Putin [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5006.54s)]
*  regime change in Russia regime change in Iran doing the bidding of all of these, you know, all of these [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5009.0599999999995s)]
*  All of these foreign countries doing the bidding of military industrial complex which stands to make a lot of money [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5018.14s)]
*  Wouldn't it be amazing if we could that true like you brought up a great point the other day? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5023.74s)]
*  But that trillion dollar budget that we now have for the military industrial complex [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5027.9400000000005s)]
*  Like why do we not have the material to protect ourselves? I guess you think that kind of budget? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5031.18s)]
*  Ask Jen Griffin shut up you hate the military you love Iran you love our enemies [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5039.42s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's so it's so frustrating and again, I don't love Iran I don't hate Israel [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5044.34s)]
*  I really am angry at the people who abandoned their own country who are positions of [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5050.099999999999s)]
*  Responsibility in their nation the nation of their birth and just abandoned it [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5054.98s)]
*  I look on them as I as I view a father who abandoned his family with true contempt [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5058.54s)]
*  I don't care how hot she was. I don't care a badger drinking problem was I don't care what your excuse was [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5062.94s)]
*  you left your family and I just I [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5067.82s)]
*  I've total contempt for that. By the way, that's not even considered bad now [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5071.26s)]
*  Right. No, it's encouraged. Like I mean you abandon your children. That's cool [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5075.099999999999s)]
*  I mean I was in the Barnes and Noble the other day and [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5079.98s)]
*  I haven't been in one of those in a long time like a big bookstore that still exists. It still exists where it was in [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5083.26s)]
*  Outside of Denver, Colorado [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5090.179999999999s)]
*  Wow [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5091.78s)]
*  And I still love going I would sit there for hours and read books get a coffee [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5092.86s)]
*  And that's how I did my most of my studying at the University of Pittsburgh was the Barnes and Noble down the street [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5096.78s)]
*  And I loved it. I loved being around books. I loved you know that environment, but [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5100.94s)]
*  My wife and I went she's like, oh my god [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5104.78s)]
*  I gotta get out of here like all of little tables for like, you know [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5106.46s)]
*  Gender studies or Jen, you know, and then there was the whole family. This really stunned us the whole family section [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5110.179999999999s)]
*  Was not about like how to improve your marriage or have a better family it was all how to get divorced [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5117.98s)]
*  First next to how to kill yourself file. Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what and they of course they push this and this is what they want [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5127.62s)]
*  You know, they don't want us to have a strong nuclear family. They don't want us to have [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5134.099999999999s)]
*  Strong neighbors friendships in the neighborhood. They want us to you know, they want they want [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5138.78s)]
*  Women to say they don't need men you get rid of get rid of men in your life [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5144.179999999999s)]
*  men [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5149.219999999999s)]
*  It's it's [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5151.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5153.34s)]
*  So these I guess I mean I have opinions and everything you said but I don't want to keep repeating myself like an old person [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5155.14s)]
*  But I guess I would just say [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5160.38s)]
*  We have a lot of problems like real real problems. Not just inflation or GDP or like actual [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5162.38s)]
*  systemic problems to steal a term that they love and [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5169.22s)]
*  You know anything that that diverts attention from that it seems really bad [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5174.18s)]
*  So this is the madness that I this is another part of my rage because I watch the the economic numbers also [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5177.900000000001s)]
*  I'm [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5184.1s)]
*  I'm not an economist play one on television. I am [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5185.7s)]
*  remember when I graduated from HBS and went to the New York Fed just for five years as an internship and [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5189.9400000000005s)]
*  Thinking I could make this a career but I said one in the cable news. Yeah, you could have worked at the Treasury, but [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5196.18s)]
*  So if you think about right now what would devastate the United States of America [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5202.42s)]
*  It's is it an intercontinental ballistic missile? No. No what would devastate the United States of America [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5207.66s)]
*  Would be five dollar gasoline [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5212.9s)]
*  So have we thought about that because when I heard them come out on TV the other night say [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5216.179999999999s)]
*  We've thought through every possible scenario as an as an attack against us after we launched these attacks on these nuclear sites [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5221.22s)]
*  We've we've gamed out everything were their words. We've gamed out everything [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5228.599999999999s)]
*  Did you game out that the Iranian Parliament just voted to close the Straits of Hormuz? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5232.0599999999995s)]
*  Did you figure that part of it out because I remember in [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5237.259999999999s)]
*  2022 under Biden when gas hit five dollars and one penny [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5241.339999999999s)]
*  We had people filling up the flatbed of their truck with tarps with gasoline because they were in panic mode [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5247.099999999999s)]
*  Biden literally emptied the strategic oil reserves as a response inflation went over nine percent [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5253.62s)]
*  The CPI number went over nine percent, which is the consumer price index [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5261.299999999999s)]
*  Which means how much are people paying for their groceries how much gas prices are included in the CPI number? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5264.86s)]
*  Five dollars [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5272.62s)]
*  Closing the Straits of Hormuz could put oil our gas prices in the United States between seven and ten dollars [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5274.299999999999s)]
*  It's only 20% of the world's petroleum [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5280.82s)]
*  Flows through there not a big deal. Have we thought about this? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5283.98s)]
*  Have we thought about how everything that we're doing right now the lights on the food that we get on our tables is [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5287.179999999999s)]
*  As would be affected by this in a massive way. I mean the only [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5293.700000000001s)]
*  You know, the only silver lining is that also China relies on the Straits of Hormuz [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5298.34s)]
*  You know in a very large way luckily they don't play the long game though. So it's not a not a concern [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5303.62s)]
*  I'm sure they're day traders just like us [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5309.38s)]
*  So China just can't flip on that Siberian oil pipeline to Russia [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5311.900000000001s)]
*  Hey, we need instead of the eight hundred thousand barrels a day that we normally get from you like let's crank it up to three [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5315.660000000001s)]
*  You okay with that Putin do you think that they have a relationship the BRICS nations have a relationship to soften this they do now [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5321.42s)]
*  So what um boy you're making me sad so I'm gonna end on [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5329.66s)]
*  Clayton it's so great to see you. That's great. So let me end on what I hope is a hopeful note. So both of us [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5334.9800000000005s)]
*  worked in television our whole lives were we you left voluntarily because you're smarter than I am but I [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5342.3s)]
*  Was expelled like a hairball from the system and [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5348.139999999999s)]
*  So you've been out how long what year did you leave [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5353.74s)]
*  2017 so eight years ago Wow crazy. I've been out two years [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5358.86s)]
*  My head is starting to clear. I feel better. Yeah, I feel like a much younger man [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5363.62s)]
*  But um, what's the what's the future of that of that business of that medium? Oh, I think it's collapsing in real time [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5366.96s)]
*  And I've I said that while I was there [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5374.62s)]
*  Yeah [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5376.9800000000005s)]
*  That this idea that people are gonna pay for a cable subscription in order to get their CNN or Rachel [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5377.900000000001s)]
*  Maddow or [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5385.76s)]
*  Sean Hannity like that's dying and that audience is dying with him. I don't know if you've ever watched Fox in the afternoon [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5386.9400000000005s)]
*  it's all ads for hip replacement or [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5394.66s)]
*  Like don't fall out of your shower stalls because you're elderly so they know their audience they know it's aging out the joke back [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5398.820000000001s)]
*  When I was at Fox was that Oh CBS is audiences like 90 [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5406.700000000001s)]
*  It was like 75 at the time, but I'm just being exaggerating [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5411.62s)]
*  So now those people are in their 90s [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5416.38s)]
*  Though that audience is not getting any younger again. I don't know anybody watching right now who's buying a cable box [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5419.660000000001s)]
*  When they go to Xfinity or Comcast and they're they're starting out they're like a young couple they're in their 20s [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5427.62s)]
*  They want to have children [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5434.2s)]
*  They don't even know what a cable box is [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5437.0199999999995s)]
*  So they're going now maybe with like, you know by a phonograph [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5438.94s)]
*  But not a cable bar and they a lot of this is like shifted over to like YouTube TV and things like that [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5442.4s)]
*  You know things so I mean there'll be people that'll still flip through but I think it's those era of like those massive [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5446.62s)]
*  Salaries and everyone's kind of I think that era is gone [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5452.96s)]
*  So I think you just answered the question that's been bothering me for the past month [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5457.240000000001s)]
*  Which is why do old people love killing so much? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5461.34s)]
*  And I I love old people. I'm not one of those people hates the elderly [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5464.400000000001s)]
*  I love the elderly my favorite person my dad was elderly when he died in 84 [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5468.320000000001s)]
*  So I'm not I've always thought we should respect our elders my whole life. I thought that so I'm conservative [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5473.06s)]
*  But in the last month that's like every old person I come into contact with it's like let's just kill them like [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5479.080000000001s)]
*  Thoughtlessly just kill people and it's like you're gonna face judgment really soon [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5485.240000000001s)]
*  Should you really be calling for killing people in your final days here? I always think that I never say it [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5489.8s)]
*  But why is that and I do think it's at least in part the result of watching [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5495.080000000001s)]
*  This filth and it is filth. It's it's wall-to-wall. I know they don't turn it off. It's worse than pornography [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5502.200000000001s)]
*  It's disgusting Keith Kellogg talking about killing people [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5508.28s)]
*  Keith Kellogg goes a complete idiot. I know Keith Kellogg is like truly stupid the idea Keith [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5511.28s)]
*  Kellogg could have any influence over anything. It's like shocking totally ignorant [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5515.759999999999s)]
*  Just enthusiastic about killing [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5520.88s)]
*  And reckless and just oh not not qualified to drive my car [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5523.759999999999s)]
*  And I'm like how who are these people and why are old people so into killing? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5528.5199999999995s)]
*  I honestly think it's because they're watching it [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5533.32s)]
*  Yeah, and we you and I know this to be true which is that I [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5535.4s)]
*  Think even Roger Ailes told us that the reason [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5539.759999999999s)]
*  Fox and Friends in the morning would do so well is because the people at night would leave their TV on [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5542.5199999999995s)]
*  Set to that channel and then wake up and it was the first thing would click on to that show and [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5548.12s)]
*  Then they leave it on all day [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5553.4s)]
*  I've heard from so many viewers over the years that are like [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5554.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, my parents would just turn on turn it on and they would leave it run all day [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5557.82s)]
*  It's just kind of like a noise in the background so every hour [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5561.64s)]
*  Doesn't matter what panel show it is with four people sitting there on a couch or one person hosting a show [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5564.76s)]
*  When 80% of your guests are pro-war and the entire narrative all day is about how Trump is amazing and carried out the most [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5571.72s)]
*  spectacular attack on America, you know on [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5579.88s)]
*  in the Middle East since we've [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5582.4400000000005s)]
*  since Normandy [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5584.4800000000005s)]
*  Then they're just sucking that in we that Barnes & Noble the other day. I met an old gentleman [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5586.88s)]
*  lovely guy and I was in the history section and he just started chatting and we just started chatting and [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5592.120000000001s)]
*  Talking to my wife and he said yeah, you know, I'm really concerned about you know, Iran getting this nuclear weapon [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5597.200000000001s)]
*  Iran getting this nuclear weapon and you know, and we said, do you know that Israel has a nuclear weapon, right? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5603.120000000001s)]
*  He said what I've never heard that is that true? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5609.280000000001s)]
*  And he's like, well, you know, I just watched I just have it on the news on did just tell me that Iran [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5613.92s)]
*  You know, it's a we got to be worried about Iran [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5618.120000000001s)]
*  So do you do you ever hear them talking about that Israel has an entire nuclear weapons program that JFK [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5620.48s)]
*  Pushed them for inspections and then pushed and pushed and pushed Ben-Gurion for inspections and then was assassinated [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5627.12s)]
*  Not saying they're related [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5632.92s)]
*  That Eisenhower warned JFK about it like this goes back to the 60s. Why don't we know about this? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5634.92s)]
*  So this guy because he's watching this like spoon-fed propaganda all day [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5640.44s)]
*  Doesn't know any of that. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5645.72s)]
*  Clay Morris ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Thank you [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5647.12s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show on one level that's not surprising that's what they do [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5650.48s)]
*  But on another level it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right now all the change taking place in our economy [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5658.48s)]
*  And our politics with the wars one the cusp of fighting right now [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5664.48s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information rather than more and that is totally wrong [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leY9FUqk1uI&t=5669.04s)]
